    "A Synthetic Data Generation Framework for Grounded Dialogues": "Training grounded response generation models often requires a large collection of grounded dialogues. However, it is costly to build such dialogues. In this paper, we present a synthetic data generation framework (SynDG) for grounded dialogues. The generation process utilizes large pre-trained language models and freely available knowledge data (e.g., Wikipedia pages, persona profiles, etc.). The key idea of designing SynDG is to consider dialogue flow and coherence in the generation process. Specifically, given knowledge data, we first heuristically determine a dialogue flow, which is a series of knowledge pieces. Then, we employ T5 to incrementally turn the dialogue flow into a dialogue. To ensure coherence of both the dialogue flow and the synthetic dialogue, we design a two-level filtering strategy, at the flow-level and the utterance-level respectively. Experiments on two public benchmarks show that the synthetic grounded dialogue data produced by our framework is able to significantly boost model performance in both full training data and low-resource scenarios.",
    "AutoConv: Automatically Generating Information-seeking Conversations with Large Language Models": "Information-seeking conversation, which aims to help users gather information through conversation, has achieved great progress in recent years. However, the research is still stymied by the scarcity of training data. To alleviate this problem, we propose AutoConv for synthetic conversation generation, which takes advantage of the few-shot learning ability and generation capacity of large language models (LLM). Specifically, we formulate the conversation generation problem as a language modeling task, then finetune an LLM with a few human conversations to capture the characteristics of the information-seeking process and use it for generating synthetic conversations with high quality. Experimental results on two frequently-used datasets verify that AutoConv has substantial improvements over strong baselines and alleviates the dependence on human annotation. In addition, we also provide several analysis studies to promote future research.",
    "BertNet: Harvesting Knowledge Graphs with Arbitrary Relations from Pretrained Language Models": "It is crucial to automatically construct knowledge graphs (KGs) of diverse new relations to support knowledge discovery and broad applications. Previous KG construction methods, based on either crowdsourcing or text mining, are often limited to a small predefined set of relations due to manual cost or restrictions in text corpus. Recent research proposed to use pretrained language models (LMs) as implicit knowledge bases that accept knowledge queries with prompts. Yet, the implicit knowledge lacks many desirable properties of a full-scale symbolic KG, such as easy access, navigation, editing, and quality assurance. In this paper, we propose a new approach of harvesting massive KGs of arbitrary relations from pretrained LMs. With minimal input of a relation definition (a prompt and a few shot of example entity pairs), the approach efficiently searches in the vast entity pair space to extract diverse accurate knowledge of the desired relation. We develop an effective search-and-rescore mechanism for improved efficiency and accuracy. We deploy the approach to harvest KGs of over 400 new relations from different LMs. Extensive human and automatic evaluations show our approach manages to extract diverse accurate knowledge, including tuples of complex relations (e.g., A is capable of but not good at B). The resulting KGs as a symbolic interpretation of the source LMs also reveal new insights into the LMs' knowledge capacities.",
    "Contrastive Novelty-Augmented Learning: Anticipating Outliers with Large Language Models": "In many task settings, text classification models are likely to encounter examples from novel classes on which they cannot predict correctly. Selective prediction, in which models abstain on low-confidence examples, provides a possible solution, but existing models are often overly confident on unseen classes. To remedy this overconfidence, we introduce Contrastive Novelty-Augmented Learning (CoNAL), a two-step method that generates OOD examples representative of novel classes, then trains to decrease confidence on them. First, we generate OOD examples by prompting a large language model twice: we prompt it to enumerate relevant novel classes, then generate examples from each novel class matching the task format. Second, we train a classifier with a novel contrastive objective that encourages lower confidence on generated OOD examples than training examples. When trained with CoNAL, classifiers improve in their ability to detect and abstain on novel class examples over prior methods by an average of 2.3% in terms of accuracy under the accuracy-coverage curve (AUAC) and 5.5% AUROC across 4 NLP datasets, with no cost to in-distribution accuracy.",
    "Cross-Domain Data Augmentation with Domain-Adaptive Language Modeling for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis": "Cross-domain Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) aims to leverage the useful knowledge from a source domain to identify aspect-sentiment pairs in sentences from a target domain. To tackle the task, several recent works explore a new unsupervised domain adaptation framework, i.e., Cross-Domain Data Augmentation (CDDA), aiming to directly generate much labeled target-domain data based on the labeled source-domain data. However, these CDDA methods still suffer from several issues: 1) preserving many source-specific attributes such as syntactic structures; 2) lack of fluency and coherence; 3) limiting the diversity of generated data. To address these issues, we propose a new cross-domain Data Augmentation approach based on Domain-Adaptive Language Modeling named DA2LM, which contains three stages: 1) assigning pseudo labels to unlabeled target-domain data; 2) unifying the process of token generation and labeling with a Domain-Adaptive Language Model (DALM) to learn the shared context and annotation across domains; 3) using the trained DALM to generate labeled target-domain data. Experiments show that DA2LM consistently outperforms previous feature adaptation and CDDA methods on both ABSA and Aspect Extraction tasks. The source code is publicly released at https://github.com/NUSTM/DALM.",
    "DISCO: Distilling Counterfactuals with Large Language Models": "Models trained with counterfactually augmented data learn representations of the causal structure of tasks, enabling robust generalization. However, high-quality counterfactual data is scarce for most tasks and not easily generated at scale. When crowdsourced, such data is typically limited in scale and diversity; when generated using supervised methods, it is computationally expensive to extend to new counterfactual dimensions. In this work, we introduce DISCO (DIStilled COunterfactual Data), a new method for automatically generating high-quality counterfactual data at scale. DISCO engineers prompts to generate phrasal perturbations with a large general language model. Then, a task-specific teacher model filters these generations to distill high-quality counterfactual data. While task-agnostic, we apply our pipeline to the task of natural language inference (NLI) and find that on challenging evaluations such as the NLI stress test, comparatively smaller student models trained with DISCO-generated counterfactuals are more robust (6% absolute) and generalize better across distributions (2%) compared to models trained without data augmentation. Furthermore, DISCO-augmented models are 10% more consistent between counterfactual pairs on three evaluation sets, demonstrating that DISCO augmentation enables models to more reliably learn causal representations.",
    "Discovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations": "As language models (LMs) scale, they develop many novel behaviors, good and bad, exacerbating the need to evaluate how they behave. Prior work creates evaluations with crowdwork (which is time-consuming and expensive) or existing data sources (which are not always available). Here, we automatically generate evaluations with LMs. We explore approaches with varying amounts of human effort, from instructing LMs to write yes/no questions to making complex Winogender schemas with multiple stages of LM-based generation and filtering. Crowdworkers rate the examples as highly relevant and agree with 90-100% of labels, sometimes more so than corresponding human-written datasets. We generate 154 datasets and discover new cases of inverse scaling where LMs get worse with size. Larger LMs repeat back a dialog user's preferred answer (“sycophancy”) and express greater desire to pursue concerning goals like resource acquisition and goal preservation. We also find some of the first examples of inverse scaling in RL from Human Feedback (RLHF), where more RLHF makes LMs worse. For example, RLHF makes LMs express stronger political views (on gun rights and immigration) and a greater desire to avoid shut down. Overall, LM-written evaluations are high-quality and let us quickly discover many novel LM behaviors.",
    "Disfluency Generation for More Robust Dialogue Systems": "Disfluencies in user utterances can trigger a chain of errors impacting all the modules of a dialogue system: natural language understanding, dialogue state tracking, and response generation. In this work, we first analyze existing dialogue datasets commonly used in research and show that they only contain a marginal number of disfluent utterances. Due to this relative absence of disfluencies in their training data, dialogue systems may then critically fail when exposed to disfluent utterances. Following this observation, we propose to augment existing datasets with disfluent user utterances by paraphrasing fluent utterances into disfluent ones. Relying on a pre-trained language model, our few-shot disfluent paraphraser guided by a disfluency classifier can generate useful disfluent utterances for training better dialogue systems. We report on improvements for both dialogue state tracking and response generation when the dialogue systems are trained on datasets augmented with our disfluent utterances.",
    "Distilling Script Knowledge from Large Language Models for Constrained Language Planning": "In everyday life, humans often plan their actions by following step-by-step instructions in the form of goal-oriented scripts. Previous work has exploited language models (LMs) to plan for abstract goals of stereotypical activities (e.g., “make a cake”), but leaves more specific goals with multi-facet constraints understudied (e.g., “make a cake for diabetics”). In this paper, we define the task of constrained language planning for the first time. We propose an overgenerate-then-filter approach to improve large language models (LLMs) on this task, and use it to distill a novel constrained language planning dataset, CoScript, which consists of 55,000 scripts. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the constrained language planning ability of LLMs, especially on constraint faithfulness. Furthermore, CoScript is demonstrated to be quite effective in endowing smaller LMs with constrained language planning ability.",
    "ECG-QALM: Entity-Controlled Synthetic Text Generation using Contextual Q&A for NER": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) state-of-the-art methods requires high-quality labeled datasets. Issues such as scarcity of labeled data, under-representation of entities, and privacy concerns with using sensitive data for training, can be significant barriers. Generating synthetic data to train models is a promising solution to mitigate these problems. We propose ECG-QALM, a contextual question and answering approach using pre-trained language models to synthetically generate entity-controlled text. Generated text is then used to augment small labeled datasets for downstream NER tasks. We evaluate our method on two publicly available datasets. We find ECG-QALM is capable of producing full text samples with desired entities appearing in a controllable way, while retaining sentence coherence closest to the real world data. Evaluations on NER tasks show significant improvements (75% - 140%) in low-labeled data regimes.",
    "Eliciting Affective Events from Language Models by Multiple View Co-prompting": "Prior research on affective event classification showed that exploiting weakly labeled data for training can improve model performance. In this work, we propose a simpler and more effective approach for generating training data by automatically acquiring and labeling affective events with Multiple View Co-prompting, which leverages two language model prompts that provide independent views of an event. The approach starts with a modest amount of gold data and prompts pre-trained language models to generate new events. Next, information about the probable affective polarity of each event is collected from two complementary language model prompts and jointly used to assign polarity labels. Experimental results on two datasets show that the newly acquired events improve a state-of-the-art affective event classifier. We also present analyses which show that using multiple views produces polarity labels of higher quality than either view on its own.",
    "Evaluation of Question Generation Needs More References": "Question generation (QG) is the task of generating a valid and fluent question based on a given context and the target answer. According to various purposes, even given the same context, instructors can ask questions about different concepts, and even the same concept can be written in different ways. However, the evaluation for QG usually depends on single reference-based similarity metrics, such as n-gram-based metric or learned metric, which is not sufficient to fully evaluate the potential of QG methods. To this end, we propose to paraphrase the reference question for a more robust QG evaluation. Using large language models such as GPT-3, we created semantically and syntactically diverse questions, then adopt the simple aggregation of the popular evaluation metrics as the final scores. Through our experiments, we found that using multiple (pseudo) references is more effective for QG evaluation while showing a higher correlation with human evaluations than evaluation with a single reference.",
    "FolkScope: Intention Knowledge Graph Construction for E-commerce Commonsense Discovery": "Understanding users' intentions in e-commerce platforms requires commonsense knowledge. In this paper, we present FolkScope, an intention knowledge graph construction framework to reveal the structure of humans' minds about purchasing items. As commonsense knowledge is usually ineffable and not expressed explicitly, it is challenging to perform information extraction. Thus, we propose a new approach that leverages the generation power of large language models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop annotation to semi-automatically construct the knowledge graph. LLMs first generate intention assertions via e-commerce-specific prompts to explain shopping behaviors, where the intention can be an open reason or a predicate falling into one of 18 categories aligning with ConceptNet, e.g., IsA, MadeOf, UsedFor, etc. Then we annotate plausibility and typicality labels of sampled intentions as training data in order to populate human judgments to all automatic generations. Last, to structurize the assertions, we propose pattern mining and conceptualization to form more condensed and abstract knowledge. Extensive evaluations and studies demonstrate that our constructed knowledge graph can well model e-commerce knowledge and have many potential applications. Our codes and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/FolkScope.",
    "Hence, Socrates is mortal: A Benchmark for Natural Language Syllogistic Reasoning": "Syllogistic reasoning, a typical form of deductive reasoning, is a critical capability widely required in natural language understanding tasks, such as text entailment and question answering. To better facilitate research on syllogistic reasoning, we develop a benchmark called SYLLOBASE that differs from existing syllogistic datasets in three aspects: (1) Covering a complete taxonomy of syllogism reasoning patterns; (2) Containing both automatically and manually constructed samples; and (3) Involving both the generation and understanding tasks. We automatically construct 50k template-based syllogism samples by mining syllogism patterns from Wikidata and ConceptNet. To improve our dataset's naturalness and challenge, we apply GPT-3 to paraphrase the template-based data and further manually rewrite 1,000 samples as the test set. State-of-the-art pretrained language models can achieve the best generation ROUGE-L of 38.72 by T5 and the best multi-choice accuracy of 72.77% by RoBERTa on SYLLOBASE, which indicates the great challenge of learning diverse syllogistic reasoning types on SYLLOBASE. Our datasets are released at https://github.com/casually-PYlearner/SYLLOBASE.",
    "I Spy a Metaphor: Large Language Models and Diffusion Models Co-Create Visual Metaphors": "Visual metaphors are powerful rhetorical devices used to persuade or communicate creative ideas through images. Similar to linguistic metaphors, they convey meaning implicitly through symbolism and juxtaposition of the symbols. We propose a new task of generating visual metaphors from linguistic metaphors. This is a challenging task for diffusion-based text-to-image models, such as DALL·E 2, since it requires the ability to model implicit meaning and compositionality. We propose to solve the task through the collaboration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion Models: Instruct GPT-3 (davinci-002) with Chain-of-Thought prompting generates text that represents a visual elaboration of the linguistic metaphor containing the implicit meaning and relevant objects, which is then used as input to the diffusion-based text-to-image models. Using a human-AI collaboration framework, where humans interact both with the LLM and the top-performing diffusion model, we create a high-quality dataset containing 6,476 visual metaphors for 1,540 linguistic metaphors and their associated visual elaborations. Evaluation by professional illustrators shows the promise of LLM-Diffusion Model collaboration for this task. To evaluate the utility of our Human-AI collaboration framework and the quality of our dataset, we perform both an intrinsic human-based evaluation and an extrinsic evaluation using visual entailment as a downstream task.",
    "Increasing Diversity While Maintaining Accuracy: Text Data Generation with Large Language Models and Human Interventions": "Large language models (LLMs) can be used to generate text data for training and evaluating other models. However, creating high-quality datasets with LLMs can be challenging. In this work, we explore human-AI partnerships to facilitate high diversity and accuracy in LLM-based text data generation. We first examine two approaches to diversify text generation: 1) logit suppression, which minimizes the generation of languages that have already been frequently generated, and 2) temperature sampling, which flattens the token sampling probability. We found that diversification approaches can increase data diversity but often at the cost of data accuracy (i.e., text and labels being appropriate for the target domain). To address this issue, we examined two human interventions, 1) label replacement (LR), correcting misaligned labels, and 2) out-of-scope filtering (OOSF), removing instances that are out of the user's domain of interest or to which no considered label applies. With oracle studies, we found that LR increases the absolute accuracy of models trained with diversified datasets by 14.4%. Moreover, we found that some models trained with data generated with LR interventions outperformed LLM-based few-shot classification. In contrast, OOSF was not effective in increasing model accuracy, implying the need for future work in human-in-the-loop text data generation.",
    "LENS: A Learnable Evaluation Metric for Text Simplification": "Training learnable metrics using modern language models has recently emerged as a promising method for the automatic evaluation of machine translation. However, existing human evaluation datasets for text simplification have limited annotations that are based on unitary or outdated models, making them unsuitable for this approach. To address these issues, we introduce the SIMPEVAL corpus that contains: SIMPEVALPAST, comprising 12K human ratings on 2.4K simplifications of 24 past systems, and SIMPEVAL2022, a challenging simplification benchmark consisting of over 1K human ratings of 360 simplifications including GPT-3.5 generated text. Training on SIMPEVAL, we present LENS, a Learnable Evaluation Metric for Text Simplification. Extensive empirical results show that LENS correlates much better with human judgment than existing metrics, paving the way for future progress in the evaluation of text simplification. We also introduce RANK & RATE, a human evaluation framework that rates simplifications from several models in a list-wise manner using an interactive interface, which ensures both consistency and accuracy in the evaluation process and is used to create the SIMPEVAL datasets.",
    "Leveraging Synthetic Targets for Machine Translation": "In this work, we provide a recipe for training machine translation models in a limited resource setting by leveraging synthetic target data generated using a large pre-trained model. We show that consistently across different benchmarks in bilingual, multilingual, and speech translation setups, training models on synthetic targets outperforms training on the actual ground-truth data. This performance gap grows bigger with increasing limits on the amount of available resources in the form of the size of the dataset and the number of parameters in the model. We also provide preliminary analysis into whether this boost in performance is linked to ease of optimization or more deterministic nature of the predictions, and whether this paradigm leads to better out-of-distribution performance across different testing domains.",
    "LM-CPPF: Paraphrasing-Guided Data Augmentation for Contrastive Prompt-Based Few-Shot Fine-Tuning": "In recent years, there has been significant progress in developing pre-trained language models for NLP. However, these models often struggle when fine-tuned on small datasets. To address this issue, researchers have proposed various adaptation approaches. Prompt-based tuning is arguably the most common way, especially for larger models. Previous research shows that adding contrastive learning to prompt-based fine-tuning is effective as it helps the model generate embeddings that are more distinguishable between classes, and it can also be more sample-efficient as the model learns from positive and negative examples simultaneously. One of the most important components of contrastive learning is data augmentation, but unlike computer vision, effective data augmentation for NLP is still challenging. This paper proposes LM-CPPF, Contrastive Paraphrasing-guided Prompt-based Fine-tuning of Language Models, which leverages prompt-based few-shot paraphrasing using generative language models, especially large language models such as GPT-3 and OPT-175B, for data augmentation. Our experiments on multiple text classification benchmarks show that this augmentation method outperforms other methods, such as easy data augmentation, back translation, and multiple templates.",
    "Marked Personas: Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models": "To recognize and mitigate harms from large language models (LLMs), we need to understand the prevalence and nuances of stereotypes in LLM outputs. Toward this end, we present Marked Personas, a prompt-based method to measure stereotypes in LLMs for intersectional demographic groups without any lexicon or data labeling. Grounded in the sociolinguistic concept of markedness (which characterizes explicitly linguistically marked categories versus unmarked defaults), our proposed method is twofold: 1) prompting an LLM to generate personas, i.e., natural language descriptions, of the target demographic group alongside personas of unmarked, default groups; 2) identifying the words that significantly distinguish personas of the target group from corresponding unmarked ones. We find that the portrayals generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 contain higher rates of racial stereotypes than human-written portrayals using the same prompts. The words distinguishing personas of marked (non-white, non-male) groups reflect patterns of othering and exoticizing these demographics. An intersectional lens further reveals tropes that dominate portrayals of marginalized groups, such as tropicalism and the hypersexualization of minoritized women. These representational harms have concerning implications for downstream applications like story generation.",
    "Playing the Part of the Sharp Bully: Generating Adversarial Examples for Implicit Hate Speech Detection": "Research on abusive content detection on social media has primarily focused on explicit forms of hate speech (HS), that are often identifiable by recognizing hateful words and expressions. Messages containing linguistically subtle and implicit forms of hate speech still constitute an open challenge for automatic hate speech detection. In this paper, we propose a new framework for generating adversarial implicit HS short-text messages using Auto-regressive Language Models. Moreover, we propose a strategy to group the generated implicit messages by their complexity levels (EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD categories) characterizing how challenging these messages are for supervised classifiers. Finally, relying on (Dinan et al., 2019; Vidgen et al., 2021), we propose a “build it, break it, fix it”, training scheme using HARD messages showing how iteratively retraining on HARD messages substantially leverages SOTA models' performances on implicit HS benchmarks.",
    "S2ynRE: Two-stage Self-training with Synthetic data for Low-resource Relation Extraction": "Current relation extraction methods suffer from the inadequacy of large-scale annotated data. While distant supervision alleviates the problem of data quantities, there still exists domain disparity in data qualities due to its reliance on domain-restrained knowledge bases. In this work, we propose S2ynRE, a framework of two-stage Self-training with Synthetic data for Relation Extraction. We first leverage the capability of large language models to adapt to the target domain and automatically synthesize large quantities of coherent, realistic training data. We then propose an accompanied two-stage self-training algorithm that iteratively and alternately learns from synthetic and golden data together. We conduct comprehensive experiments and detailed ablations on popular relation extraction datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Code is available at https://github.com/BenfengXu/S2ynRE.",
    "Synthetic Text Generation with Differential Privacy: A Simple and Practical Recipe": "Privacy concerns have attracted increasing attention in data-driven products due to the tendency of machine learning models to memorize sensitive training data. Generating synthetic versions of such data with a formal privacy guarantee, such as differential privacy (DP), provides a promising path to mitigating these privacy concerns, but previous approaches in this direction have typically failed to produce synthetic data of high quality. In this work, we show that a simple and practical recipe in the text domain is effective: simply fine-tuning a pre-trained generative language model with DP enables the model to generate useful synthetic text with strong privacy protection. Through extensive empirical analyses on both benchmark and private customer data, we demonstrate that our method produces synthetic text that is competitive in terms of utility with its non-private counterpart, meanwhile providing strong protection against potential privacy leakages.",
    "Targeted Data Generation: Finding and Fixing Model Weaknesses": "Even when aggregate accuracy is high, state-of-the-art NLP models often fail systematically on specific subgroups of data, resulting in unfair outcomes and eroding user trust. Additional data collection may not help in addressing these weaknesses, as such challenging subgroups may be unknown to users, and under-represented in the existing and new data. We propose Targeted Data Generation (TDG), a framework that automatically identifies challenging subgroups, and generates new data for those subgroups using large language models (LLMs) with a human in the loop. TDG estimates the expected benefit and potential harm of data augmentation for each subgroup, and selects the ones most likely to improve within-group performance without hurting overall performance. In our experiments, TDG significantly improves the accuracy on challenging subgroups for state-of-the-art sentiment analysis and natural language inference models, while also improving overall test accuracy.",
    "Uncertainty-Aware Unlikelihood Learning Improves Generative Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction": "Recently, aspect sentiment quad prediction has received widespread attention in the field of aspect-based sentiment analysis. Existing studies extract quadruplets via pre-trained generative language models to paraphrase the original sentence into a templated target sequence. However, previous works only focus on what to generate but ignore what not to generate. We argue that considering the negative samples also leads to potential benefits. In this work, we propose a template-agnostic method to control the token-level generation, which boosts original learning and reduces mistakes simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce Monte Carlo dropout to understand the built-in uncertainty of pre-trained language models, acquiring the noises and errors. We further propose marginalized unlikelihood learning to suppress the uncertainty-aware mistake tokens. Finally, we introduce minimization entropy to balance the effects of marginalized unlikelihood learning. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various generation templates.",
    "Unnatural Instructions: Tuning Language Models with (Almost) No Human Labor": "Instruction tuning enables pretrained language models to perform new tasks from inference-time natural language descriptions. These approaches rely on vast amounts of human supervision in the form of crowdsourced datasets or user interactions. In this work, we introduce Unnatural Instructions: a large dataset of creative and diverse instructions, collected with virtually no human labor. We collect 64,000 examples by prompting a language model with three seed examples of instructions and eliciting a fourth. This set is then expanded by prompting the model to rephrase each instruction, creating a total of approximately 240,000 examples of instructions, inputs, and outputs. Experiments show that despite containing a fair amount of noise, training on Unnatural Instructions rivals the effectiveness of training on open-source manually-curated datasets, surpassing the performance of models such as T0++ and Tk-Instruct across various benchmarks. These results demonstrate the potential of model-generated data as a cost-effective alternative to crowdsourcing for dataset expansion and diversification.",
    "Unsupervised Graph-Text Mutual Conversion with a Unified Pretrained Language Model": "Graph-to-text (G2T) generation and text-to-graph (T2G) triple extraction are two essential tasks for knowledge graphs. Existing unsupervised approaches become suitable candidates for jointly learning the two tasks due to their avoidance of using graph-text parallel data. However, they adopt multiple complex modules and still require entity information or relation type for training. To this end, we propose INFINITY, a simple yet effective unsupervised method with a unified pretrained language model that does not introduce external annotation tools or additional parallel information. It achieves fully unsupervised graph-text mutual conversion for the first time. Specifically, INFINITY treats both G2T and T2G as a bidirectional sequence generation task by fine-tuning only one pretrained seq2seq model. A novel back-translation-based framework is then designed to generate synthetic parallel data automatically. Besides, we investigate the impact of graph linearization and introduce the structure-aware fine-tuning strategy to alleviate possible performance deterioration via retaining structural information in graph sequences. As a fully unsupervised framework, INFINITY is empirically verified to outperform state-of-the-art baselines for G2T and T2G tasks. Additionally, we also devise a new training setting called cross learning for low-resource unsupervised information extraction."
