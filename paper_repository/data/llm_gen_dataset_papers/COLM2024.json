    "ScenicNL Generating Probabilistic Scenario Programs from Natural Language": "For cyber-physical systems, including robotics and autonomous vehicles, mass deployment has been hindered by fatal errors that occur when operating in rare events. To better understand failure modes, companies meticulously recreate rare crash events in simulation, but current methods do not easily allow for exploring ”what if” scenarios which could reveal how accidents might have been avoided. We present ScenicNL, an AI system that generates probabilistic scenario programs from natural language. Given the abundance of documented failures of autonomous vehicles due to regulatory requirements, we apply ScenicNL to police crash reports, providing a data-driven approach to capturing and understanding these failures. By using a probabilistic language such as Scenic, we can clearly and concisely represent such scenarios of interest and easily ask \"what if\" questions. We demonstrate how commonplace prompting techniques with Large Language Models are incapable of generating code for low-resource languages such as Scenic. We propose an AI system via the composition of several prompting techniques to extract the reasoning abilities needed to model probability distributions around the uncertainty in the crash events. Our system then uses Constrained Decoding and tools such as a compiler and simulator to produce scenario programs in this low-resource setting. We evaluate our system on publicly available autonomous vehicle crash reports in California from the last five years and share insights into how we generate code that is both semantically meaningful and syntactically correct. Finally, we release our code and a collection of over 500 crash reports from the California Department of Motor Vehicles.",
    "TarGEN Targeted Data Generation with Large Language Models": "We present TarGEN, a multi-step prompting strategy for generating high-quality synthetic datasets using LLMs. An advantage of TarGEN is its seedless nature; it does not require specific task instances, broadening its applicability beyond task replication. This differentiates it from other data generation techniques, as it can be leveraged for novel or highly domain-specific tasks with no existing data instances. We augment TarGEN with a self-correction module that enables LLMs to rectify inaccurately labeled instances during dataset creation, ensuring reliable labels. To assess our technique's effectiveness against existing baselines, we emulate eight tasks from the SuperGLUE benchmark to create a \"synthetic\" version and finetune various language models on both synthetic and original training sets. Evaluation on the original test set reveals that models trained on the synthetic datasets perform ~1-3% points higher than those trained on original datasets. Finally, when pre-finetuned on our \"synthetic\" SuperGLUE dataset, Llama2 (7B) yields impressive results on the OpenLLM leaderboard, surpassing the model trained on the Self-Instruct dataset by 2.62% points. Our analysis reveals that the synthetic data generated by TarGEN not only improves model learning, but also has comparable or higher levels of complexity, diversity, and similar levels of bias in comparison with the original data.",
    "3M-Diffusion Latent Multi-Modal Diffusion for Language-Guided Molecular Structure Generation": "Generating molecular structures with desired properties is a critical task with broad applications in drug discovery and materials design. We propose 3M-Diffusion, a novel multi-modal molecular graph generation method, to generate diverse, ideally novel molecular structures with desired properties.  3M-Diffusion encodes molecular graphs into a graph latent space which it then aligns with the text space learned by encoder-based LLMs from textual descriptions. It then reconstructs the molecular structure and atomic attributes based on the given text descriptions using the molecule decoder. It then learns a probabilistic mapping from the text space to the latent molecular graph space using a diffusion model. The results of our extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that 3M-Diffusion can generate high-quality, novel and diverse molecular graphs that semantically match the textual description provided.",
    "ChatGPT Based Data Augmentation for Improved Parameter-Efficient Debiasing of LLMs": "Large Language models (LLMs), while powerful, exhibit harmful social biases. Debiasing is often challenging due to computational costs, data constraints, and potential degradation of multi-task language capabilities. This work introduces a novel approach utilizing ChatGPT to generate synthetic training data, aiming to enhance the debiasing of LLMs. We propose two strategies: Targeted Prompting, which provides effective debiasing for known biases but necessitates prior specification of bias in question; and General Prompting, which, while slightly less effective, offers debiasing across various categories. We leverage resource-efficient LLM debiasing using adapter tuning and compare the effectiveness of our synthetic data to existing debiasing datasets. Our results reveal that: (1) ChatGPT can efficiently produce high-quality training data for debiasing other LLMs; (2) data produced via our approach surpasses existing datasets in debiasing performance while also preserving internal knowledge of a pre-trained LLM; and (3) synthetic data exhibits generalizability across categories, effectively mitigating various biases, including intersectional ones. These findings underscore the potential of synthetic data in advancing the fairness of LLMs with minimal retraining cost.",
    "Starling-7B Improving Helpfulness and Harmlessness with RLAIF": "This paper presents Starling-7B, the current best-performing 7B chat model on Chatbot Arena, along with its training dataset Nectar, a high-quality preference dataset collected by prompting GPT-4 to rank responses. We propose an internal pairwise rating technique, where the model considers all pairings before providing a ranking decision, leveraging the proven pairwise rating capability of LLMs without the cost of individual pairwise calls. The resulting Nectar dataset comprises 182,954 chat prompts, each with seven responses from various models, ranked by GPT-4, equating to 3.8 million high-quality pairwise comparisons. We introduce Starling-RM-7B and Starling-RM-34B, the reward model suites trained with a K-wise preference loss on Nectar, outperforming pairwise counterparts. We benchmark reward model training pipelines across metrics such as human preference, truthfulness, and safety. Using Nectar and our new training pipeline, we fine-tuned Openchat-3.5 to create Starling-LM-7B, achieving significant performance enhancements on MT-Bench, AlpacaEval, and human evaluation metrics. To facilitate research and understanding of RLHF mechanisms, we open-source the Nectar dataset, the reward models, and the language models.",
    "Iteratively Prompting Multimodal LLMs to Reproduce Natural and AI-Generated Images": "With the digital imagery landscape rapidly evolving, image stocks and AI-generated image marketplaces have become central to visual media. Traditional stock images now exist alongside innovative platforms that trade in prompts for AI-generated visuals, driven by sophisticated APIs like DALL-E 3 and Midjourney.  This paper studies the possibility of employing multi-modal models with enhanced visual understanding to mimic the outputs of these platforms, introducing an original attack strategy. Our method leverages fine-tuned CLIP models, a multi-label classifier, and the descriptive capabilities of GPT-4V to create prompts that generate images similar to those available in marketplaces and from premium stock image providers, yet at a markedly lower expense. In presenting this strategy, we aim to spotlight a new class of economic and security considerations within the realm of digital imagery. Our findings, supported by both automated metrics and human assessment, reveal that comparable visual content can be produced for a fraction of the prevailing market prices (\\$0.23 - \\$0.27 per image), emphasizing the need for awareness and strategic discussions about the integrity of digital media in an increasingly AI-integrated landscape. Additionally, this approach holds promise as a tool for data augmentation, potentially enhancing machine learning models by providing varied and cost-effective training data. Our work also contributes to the field by assembling a dataset consisting of approximately 19 million prompt-image pairs generated by the popular Midjourney platform, which we plan to release publicly.",
    "Does Collaborative Human–LM Dialogue Generation Help Information Extraction from Human–Human Dialogues": "The capabilities of pretrained language models (LMs) have opened opportunities to explore new application areas, but applications involving human-human interaction are limited by the fact that most data is protected from public release for privacy reasons. Problem-solving human-human dialogues in real applications can be much more complex than existing Wizard-of-Oz collections, preventing successful domain transfer. To support information extraction (IE) for a private call center dataset (AIC), we introduce a human-in-the-loop dialogue generation framework capable of synthesizing realistic dialogues. In IE experiments with AIC dialogues, we observe 25% relative improvement in F1 after augmenting a small set of real human-human conversations with synthetic data. In controlled experiments, we compare training with our human-in-the-loop-synthesized data vs. fully automatically LM-generated data and find that collaborating humans adds value both in the generation and annotation stages. We release code and our synthetic dataset to illustrate the complexity of call center conversations and encourage development of complex dialogue datasets that are more representative of natural data.",
    "Evaluating Cultural Adaptability of a Large Language Model via Simulation of Synthetic Personas": "The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multicultural environments hinges on their ability to understand users' diverse cultural backgrounds. We measure this capability by having an LLM simulate human profiles representing various nationalities within the scope of a questionnaire-style psychological experiment. Specifically, we employ GPT-3.5 to reproduce reactions to persuasive news articles of 7,286 participants from 15 countries; comparing the results with a dataset of real participants sharing the same demographic traits.  Our analysis shows that specifying a person's country of residence improves GPT-3.5's alignment with their responses. In contrast, using native language prompting introduces shifts that significantly reduce overall alignment, with some languages particularly impairing performance. These findings suggest that while direct nationality information enhances the model's cultural adaptability, native language cues do not reliably improve simulation fidelity and can detract from the model's effectiveness.",
    "FABLES Evaluating faithfulness and content selection in book-length summarization": "While long-context large language models (LLMs) can technically summarize book-length documents (> 100K tokens), the length and complexity of the documents have so far prohibited evaluations of input-dependent aspects like faithfulness. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale human evaluation of faithfulness and content selection on LLM-generated summaries of fictional books. Our study mitigates the issue of data contamination by focusing on summaries of books published in 2023 or 2024, and we hire annotators who have fully read each book prior to the annotation task to minimize cost and cognitive burden. We collect FABLES, a dataset of annotations on 3,158 claims made in LLM-generated summaries of 26 books, at a cost of $5.2K USD, which allows us to rank LLM summarizers based on faithfulness: CLAUDE-3-OPUS significantly outperforms all closedsource LLMs, while the open-source MIXTRAL is on par with GPT-3.5-TURBO. An analysis of the annotations reveals that most unfaithful claims relate to events and character states, and they generally require indirect reasoning over the narrative to invalidate. While LLM-based auto-raters have proven reliable for factuality and coherence in other settings, we implement several LLM raters of faithfulness and find that none correlates strongly with human annotations, especially with regard to detecting unfaithful claims. Our experiments suggest that detecting unfaithful claims is an important future direction not only for summarization evaluation but also as a testbed for long-context understanding. Finally, we move beyond faithfulness by exploring content selection errors in book-length summarization: we develop a typology of omission errors related to crucial narrative elements and also identify a systematic over-emphasis on events occurring towards the end of the book. We release FABLES to spur further research on the evaluation of book-length summarization.",
    "Forcing Diffuse Distributions out of Language Models": "Despite being trained specifically to follow user instructions, today's instruction-tuned language models perform poorly when instructed to produce random outputs. For example, when prompted to pick a number uniformly between one and ten Llama-2-13B-chat disproportionately favors the number five, and when tasked with picking a first name at random, Mistral-7B-Instruct chooses Avery 40 times more often than we would expect based on the U.S. population. When these language models are used for real-world tasks where diversity of outputs is crucial, such as language model assisted dataset construction, their inability to produce diffuse distributions over valid choices is a major hurdle. In this work, we propose a fine-tuning method that encourages language models to output distributions that are diffuse over valid outcomes. The methods we introduce generalize across a variety of tasks and distributions and make large language models practical for synthetic dataset generation with little human intervention.",
    "See What LLMs Cannot Answer A Self-Challenge Framework for Uncovering LLM Weaknesses": "The impressive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) has consistently surpassed numerous human-designed benchmarks, presenting new challenges in assessing the shortcomings of LLMs.  Designing tasks and finding LLMs' limitations are becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we investigate the question of whether an LLM can discover its own limitations from the errors it makes.  To this end, we propose a Self-Challenge evaluation framework with human-in-the-loop. Starting from seed instances that GPT-4 fails to answer, we prompt GPT-4 to summarize error patterns that can be used to generate new instances and incorporate human feedback on them to refine these patterns for generating more challenging data, iteratively. We end up with 8 diverse patterns, such as text manipulation and questions with assumptions.  We then build a benchmark, SC-G4, consisting of 1,835 instances generated by GPT-4 using these patterns, with human-annotated gold responses. The SC-G4 serves as a challenging benchmark that allows for a detailed assessment of LLMs' abilities.  Our results show that only 44.96\\% of instances in SC-G4 can be answered correctly by GPT-4.  Interestingly, our pilot study indicates that these error patterns also challenge other LLMs, such as Claude-3 and Llama-3, and cannot be fully resolved through fine-tuning. Our work takes the first step to demonstrate that LLMs can autonomously identify their inherent flaws and provide insights for future dynamic and automatic evaluation.",
    "Generating Synthetic Datasets for Few-shot Prompt Tuning": "A major limitation of prompt tuning is its dependence on large labeled training datasets. Under few-shot learning settings, prompt tuning lags far behind full-model fine-tuning, limiting its scope of application. In this paper, we leverage the powerful LLMs to synthesize task-specific labeled data for training the soft prompts. We first introduce a distribution-aligned weighted generator tuning (DawGen) method to encourage generating in-distribution data that aligns with the few-shot real data. Then, we train soft prompts on both synthetic and real datasets using a gradient surgery approach, which eliminates the conflicting gradients from different data sources. Experiments on seven sentence-pair classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for boosting prompt tuning in few-shot learning settings. Results on QQP, MRPC, and SICK datasets are even comparable to the performance of transfer learning from large real-world datasets, showing the promise of synthetic data as an alternative for enhancing soft prompt tuning.",
    "Stream of Search (SoS) Learning to Search in Language": "Language models are rarely shown fruitful mistakes while training. They then struggle to look beyond the next token, suffering from a snowballing of errors and struggling to predict the consequence of their actions several steps ahead. In this paper, we show how language models can be taught to search by representing the process of search in language, as a flattened string --- stream of search (SoS). We propose a unified language for search that captures an array of different symbolic search strategies. We demonstrate our approach using the simple yet difficult game of Countdown, where the goal is to combine input numbers with arithmetic operations to reach a target number. We pretrain a transformer-based language model from scratch on a dataset of streams of search generated by heuristic solvers. We find that SoS pretraining increases search accuracy by 25\\% over models trained to predict only the optimal search trajectory.  We further finetune this model with two policy improvement methods: Advantage-Induced Policy Alignment (APA) and Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR). The finetuned SoS models solve 36\\% of previously unsolved problems, including problems that cannot be solved by any of the heuristic solvers. Our results indicate that language models can learn to solve problems via search, self-improve to flexibly use different search strategies, and potentially discover new ones.",
    "Hummer Towards Limited Competitive Preference Dataset": "Preference datasets are essential for incorporating human preferences into pre-trained language models, playing a key role in the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, these datasets often demonstrate conflicting alignment objectives, leading to increased vulnerability to jailbreak attacks and challenges in adapting downstream tasks to prioritize specific alignment objectives without negatively impacting others. In this work, we introduce a novel statistical metric, Alignment Dimension Conflict, to quantify the degree of conflict within preference datasets. We then present \\texttt{Hummer} and its fine-grained variant, \\texttt{Hummer-F}, as innovative pairwise preference datasets with reduced-conflict alignment objectives. \\texttt{Hummer} is built based on UltraFeedback and is enhanced by AI feedback from GPT-4, marking as the first preference dataset aimed at reducing the competition between alignment objectives. Furthermore, we develop reward models, \\texttt{HummerRM} and \\texttt{HummerRM-F}, which employ a hybrid sampling approach to balance diverse alignment objectives effectively. This sampling method positions \\texttt{HummerRM} as an ideal model for domain-specific further fine-tuning and reducing vulnerability to jailbreak attacks.",
    "Prompt Public Large Language Models to Synthesize Data for Private On-device Applications": "Pre-training on public data is an effective method to improve the performance for federated learning (FL) with differential privacy (DP). This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) trained on public data can improve the quality of pre-training data for the on-device language models trained with DP and FL. We carefully design LLM prompts to filter and transform existing public data, and generate new data to resemble the real user data distribution. The model pre-trained on our synthetic dataset achieves relative improvement of 19.0\\% and 22.8\\% in next word prediction accuracy compared to the baseline model pre-trained on a standard public dataset, when evaluated over the real user data in Gboard (Google Keyboard, a production mobile keyboard application). Furthermore, our method achieves evaluation accuracy better than or comparable to the baseline during the DP FL fine-tuning over the user data from millions of mobile devices, and our final model outperforms the baseline in production A/B testing. Our experiments demonstrate the strengths of LLMs in synthesizing data close to the private distribution even without accessing the private data, and also suggest future research directions to further reduce the distribution gap.",
    "EnvGen Generating and Adapting Environments via LLMs for Training Embodied Agents": "Recent state-of-the-art approaches for embodied learning via interaction directly employ large language models (LLMs) as agents to determine the next steps in an environment. Due to their world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, LLM agents achieve stronger performance than previous smaller agents based on reinforcement learning (RL); however, frequently calling LLMs is slow and expensive. This begs an interesting question: Instead of directly employing LLMs as embodied agents, can we use LLMs' reasoning capabilities to adaptively create training environments to help smaller embodied RL agents learn useful skills that they are weak at? In this work, we propose EnvGen, a novel framework to address this question. First, we prompt an LLM to generate training environments that allow agents to quickly learn different tasks in parallel. Concretely, the LLM is given the task description and environment simulator objectives that the agents should learn and is then asked to generate a set of environment configurations (e.g., different terrains, items initially given to agents, chances of finding certain objects, etc.). Next, we train a small RL agent in a mixture of the original and LLM-generated environments. Then, we enable the LLM to continuously adapt the generated environments to progressively improve the skills that the agent is weak at, by providing feedback to the LLM in the form of the agent's performance. We demonstrate the usefulness of EnvGen with comprehensive experiments in Crafter and Heist game environments. We find that a small RL agent trained with EnvGen can outperform SOTA methods, including a GPT-4 agent, and learns long-horizon tasks significantly faster. We also show that using an LLM to adapt environments dynamically outperforms curriculum learning approaches and how the LLM adapts training environments to help improve RL agents' weaker skills over time. Additionally, EnvGen is substantially more efficient as it only uses a small number of LLM calls (e.g., 4 in total), whereas LLM agents require one or more LLM calls per step (resulting in thousands of LLM calls per episode). We also present detailed analyses of EnvGen's design choices.",
    "DiagrammerGPT Generating Open-Domain, Open-Platform Diagrams via LLM Planning": "Text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen significant growth over the past few years. Despite this, there has been little work on generating diagrams with T2I models. A diagram is a symbolic/schematic representation that explains information using structurally rich and spatially complex visualizations (e.g., a dense combination of related objects, text labels, directional arrows/lines, etc.). Existing state-of-the-art T2I models often fail at diagram generation because they lack fine-grained object layout control when many objects are densely connected via complex relations such as arrows/lines, and also often fail to render comprehensible text labels. To address this gap, we present DiagrammerGPT, a novel two-stage text-to-diagram generation framework leveraging the layout guidance capabilities of LLMs to generate more accurate diagrams. In the first stage, we use LLMs to generate and iteratively refine ‘diagram plans' (in a planner-auditor feedback loop). In the second stage, we use a diagram generator, DiagramGLIGEN, and a text label rendering module to generate diagrams (with clear text labels) following the diagram plans. To benchmark the text-to-diagram generation task, we introduce AI2D-Caption, a densely annotated diagram dataset built on top of the AI2D dataset. We show that our DiagrammerGPT framework produces more accurate diagrams, outperforming existing T2I models. We also provide comprehensive analysis, including open-domain diagram generation, multi-platform vector graphic diagram generation, human-in-the-loop editing, and multimodal planner/auditor LLMs.",
    "Self-Guide Better Task-Specific Instruction Following via Self-Synthetic Finetuning": "Large language models (LLMs) hold the promise of solving diverse tasks when provided with appropriate natural language prompts. However, prompting often leads models to make predictions with lower accuracy compared to finetuning a model with ample training data. On the other hand, while finetuning LLMs on task-specific data generally improves their performance, abundant annotated datasets are not available for all tasks. Previous work has explored generating task-specific data from state-of-the-art LLMs and using this data to finetune smaller models, but this approach requires access to a language model other than the one being trained, which introduces cost, scalability challenges, and legal hurdles associated with continuously relying on more powerful LLMs. In response to these, we propose Self-Guide, a multi-stage mechanism in which we synthesize task-specific input-output pairs from the student LLM, then use these input-output pairs to finetune the student LLM itself. In our empirical evaluation of the Natural Instructions V2 benchmark, we find that Self-Guide improves the performance of LLM by a substantial margin. Specifically, we report an absolute improvement of approximately 15% for classification tasks and 18% for generation tasks in the benchmark's metrics. This sheds light on the promise of self-synthesized data guiding LLMs towards becoming task-specific experts without any external learning signals.",
    "Description-Based Text Similarity": "Identifying texts with a given semantics is central for many information seeking scenarios. Similarity search over vector embeddings appear to be central to this ability, yet the similarity reflected in current text embeddings is corpus-driven, and is inconsistent and sub-optimal for many use cases. What, then, is a good notion of similarity for effective retrieval of text?  We identify the need to search for texts based on abstract descriptions of their content, and the corresponding notion of \\emph{description based similarity}. We demonstrate the inadequacy of current text embeddings and propose an alternative model that significantly improves when used in standard nearest neighbor search. The model is trained using positive and negative pairs sourced through prompting a LLM, demonstrating how data from LLMs can be used for creating new capabilities not immediately possible using the original model."
