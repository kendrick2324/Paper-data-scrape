    "MarioGPT Open-Ended Text2Level Generation through Large Language Models": "Procedural Content Generation (PCG) is a technique to generate complex and diverse environments in an automated way. However, while generating content with PCG methods is often straightforward, generating meaningful content that reflects specific  intentions and constraints remains challenging. Furthermore, many PCG algorithms lack the ability to generate content in an open-ended manner. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have  shown to be incredibly effective in many diverse domains. These trained LLMs can be fine-tuned, re-using information and accelerating training for new tasks. Here, we introduce MarioGPT, a fine-tuned GPT2 model trained to generate tile-based game levels, in our case Super Mario Bros levels. MarioGPT can not only generate diverse levels, but can be  text-prompted for controllable level generation, addressing one of the key challenges of current PCG techniques.  As far as we know, MarioGPT is the first text-to-level model and combined with novelty search it enables the  generation of diverse levels with varying play-style dynamics (i.e. player paths) and the open-ended discovery of an increasingly diverse range of content. \nCode available at https://github.com/shyamsn97/mario-gpt.",
    "ALGO Synthesizing Algorithmic Programs with Generated Oracle Verifiers": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at implementing code from functionality descriptions but struggle with algorithmic problems that require not only implementation but also identification of the suitable algorithm. Moreover, LLM-generated programs lack guaranteed correctness and require human verification. To address these challenges, we propose ALGO, a framework that synthesizes Algorithmic programs with LLM-Generated Oracles to guide the generation and verify their correctness. ALGO first generates a reference oracle by prompting an LLM to exhaustively enumerate all the combinations of relevant variables. This oracle is then utilized to guide an arbitrary search strategy in exploring the algorithm space and to verify the synthesized algorithms. Our study shows that the LLM-generated\noracles are correct for 88% of the cases. With the oracles as verifiers, ALGO can be integrated with any existing code generation model in a model-agnostic manner to enhance its performance. Experiments show that when equipped with ALGO, we achieve an 8× better one-submission pass rate over the Codex model and a 2.6× better one-submission pass rate over CodeT, the current state-of-the-art model on CodeContests. We can also get 1.3× better pass rate over the ChatGPT Code Interpreter on unseen problems. The problem set we used for testing, the prompts we used, the verifier and solution programs, and the test cases generated by ALGO\nare available at https://github.com/zkx06111/ALGO.",
    "Localized Symbolic Knowledge Distillation for Visual Commonsense Models": "Instruction following vision-language (VL) models offer a flexible\ninterface that supports a broad range of multimodal tasks in a zero-shot fashion.\nHowever, interfaces that operate on full images do not directly enable the user to\n“point to\" and access specific regions within images. This capability is important\nnot only to support reference-grounded VL benchmarks, but also, for practical\napplications that require precise within-image reasoning. We build Localized\nVisual Commonsense model which allows users to specify (multiple) regions-\nas-input. We train our model by sampling localized commonsense knowledge\nfrom a large language model (LLM): specifically, we prompt a LLM to collect\ncommonsense knowledge given a global literal image description and a local\nliteral region description automatically generated by a set of VL models. This\npipeline is scalable and fully automatic, as no aligned or human-authored image\nand text pairs are required. With a separately trained critic model that selects\nhigh quality examples, we find that training on the localized commonsense corpus\nexpanded solely from images can successfully distill existing VL models to support\na reference-as-input interface. Empirical results and human evaluations in zero-shot\nsettings demonstrate that our distillation method results in more precise VL models\nof reasoning compared to a baseline of passing a generated referring expression.",
    "Generating Images with Multimodal Language Models": "We propose a method to fuse frozen text-only large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained image encoder and decoder models, by mapping between their embedding spaces. Our model demonstrates a wide suite of multimodal capabilities: image retrieval, novel image generation, and multimodal dialogue. Ours is the first approach capable of conditioning on arbitrarily interleaved image and text inputs to generate coherent image (and text) outputs. To achieve strong performance on image generation, we propose an efficient mapping network to ground the LLM to an off-the-shelf text-to-image generation model. This mapping network translates hidden representations of text into the embedding space of the visual models, enabling us to leverage the strong text representations of the LLM for visual outputs. Our approach outperforms baseline generation models on tasks with longer and more complex language. In addition to novel image generation, our model is also capable of image retrieval from a prespecified dataset, and decides whether to retrieve or generate at inference time. This is done with a learnt decision module which conditions on the hidden representations of the LLM. Our model exhibits a wider range of capabilities compared to prior multimodal language models. It can process image-and-text inputs, and produce retrieved images, generated images, and generated text — outperforming non-LLM based generation models across several text-to-image tasks that measure context dependence.",
    "PoET A generative model of protein families as sequences-of-sequences": "Generative protein language models are a natural way to design new proteins with desired functions. However, current models are either difficult to direct to produce a protein from a specific family of interest, or must be trained on a large multiple sequence alignment (MSA) from the specific family of interest, making them unable to benefit from transfer learning across families. To address this, we propose **P**r**o**tein **E**volutionary **T**ransformer (PoET), an autoregressive generative model of whole protein families that learns to generate sets of related proteins as sequences-of-sequences across tens of millions of natural protein sequence clusters. PoET can be used as a retrieval-augmented language model to generate and score arbitrary modifications conditioned on any protein family of interest, and can extrapolate from short context lengths to generalize well even for small families. This is enabled by a unique Transformer layer; we model tokens sequentially within sequences while attending between sequences order invariantly, allowing PoET to scale to context lengths beyond those used during training. In extensive experiments on deep mutational scanning datasets, we show that PoET outperforms existing protein language models and evolutionary sequence models for variant function prediction across proteins of all MSA depths. We also demonstrate PoET's ability to controllably generate new protein sequences.",
    "DiffVL Scaling Up Soft Body Manipulation using Vision-Language Driven Differentiable Physics": "Combining gradient-based trajectory optimization with differentiable physics simulation is an efficient technique for solving soft-body manipulation problems.\nUsing a well-crafted optimization objective, the solver can quickly converge onto a valid trajectory.\nHowever, writing the appropriate objective functions requires expert knowledge, making it difficult to collect a large set of naturalistic problems from non-expert users.\nWe introduce DiffVL, a method that enables non-expert users to communicate soft-body manipulation tasks -- a combination of vision and natural language, given in multiple stages -- that can be readily leveraged by a differential physics solver. \nWe have developed GUI tools that enable non-expert users to specify 100 tasks inspired by real-life soft-body manipulations from online videos, which we'll make public.\nWe leverage large language models to translate task descriptions into machine-interpretable optimization objectives. The optimization objectives can help differentiable physics solvers to solve these long-horizon multistage tasks that are challenging for previous baselines.",
    "Is Your Code Generated by ChatGPT Really Correct Rigorous Evaluation of Large Language Models for Code Generation": "Program synthesis has been long studied with recent approaches focused on directly using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code. Programming benchmarks, with curated synthesis problems and test-cases, are used to measure the performance of various LLMs on code synthesis. However, these test-cases can be limited in both quantity and quality for fully assessing the functional correctness of the generated code. Such limitation in the existing benchmarks begs the following question: In the era of LLMs, is the code generated really correct? To answer this, we propose EvalPlus – a code synthesis evaluation framework to rigorously benchmark the functional correctness of LLM-synthesized code. EvalPlus augments a given evaluation dataset with large amounts of test-cases newly produced by an automatic test input generator, powered by both LLM- and mutation-based strategies. While EvalPlus is general, we extend the test-cases of the popular HumanEval benchmark by 80x to build HumanEval+. Our extensive evaluation across 26 popular LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 and ChatGPT) demonstrates that HumanEval+ is able to catch significant amounts of previously undetected wrong code synthesized by LLMs, reducing the pass@k by up-to 19.3-28.9%. We also surprisingly found that test insufficiency can lead to mis-ranking. For example, both WizardCoder-CodeLlama and Phind-CodeLlama now outperform ChatGPT on HumanEval+, while none of them could on HumanEval. Our work not only indicates that prior popular code synthesis evaluation results do not accurately reflect the true performance of LLMs for code synthesis, but also opens up a new direction to improve such programming benchmarks through automated testing. We have open-sourced our tools, enhanced datasets as well as all LLM-generated code at https://github.com/evalplus/evalplus to facilitate and accelerate future LLM-for-code research.",
    "GPT4Tools Teaching Large Language Model to Use Tools via Self-instruction": "This paper aims to efficiently enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to use multi-modal tools.\nThe advanced proprietary LLMs, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have shown great potential for tool usage through sophisticated prompt engineering.\nNevertheless, these models typically rely on prohibitive computational costs and publicly inaccessible data.\nTo address these challenges, we propose the GPT4Tools based on self-instruct to enable open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and OPT, to use tools.\nIt generates an instruction-following dataset by prompting an advanced teacher with various multi-modal contexts.\nBy using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) optimization, our approach facilitates the open-source LLMs to solve a range of visual problems, including visual comprehension and image generation.\nMoreover, we provide a benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLMs to use tools, which is performed in both zero-shot and fine-tuning ways.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various language models, which not only significantly improves the accuracy of invoking seen tools, but also enables the zero-shot capacity for unseen tools.",
    "LANCE Stress-testing Visual Models by Generating Language-guided Counterfactual Images": "We propose an automated algorithm to stress-test a trained visual model by generating language-guided counterfactual test images (LANCE). Our method leverages recent progress in large language modeling and text-based image editing to augment an IID test set with a suite of diverse, realistic, and challenging test images without altering model weights. We benchmark the performance of a diverse set of pre-trained models on our generated data and observe significant and consistent performance drops. We further analyze model sensitivity across different types of edits, and demonstrate its applicability at surfacing previously unknown class-level model biases in ImageNet. Code is available at https://github.com/virajprabhu/lance.",
    "LaFTer Label-Free Tuning of Zero-shot Classifier using Language and Unlabeled Image Collections": "Recently, large-scale pre-trained Vision and Language (VL) models have set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in zero-shot visual classification enabling open-vocabulary recognition of potentially unlimited set of categories defined as simple language prompts. However, despite these great advances, the performance of these zero-shot classifiers still falls short of the results of dedicated (closed category set) classifiers trained with supervised fine-tuning. In this paper we show, for the first time, how to reduce this gap without any labels and without any paired VL data, using an unlabeled image collection and a set of texts auto-generated using a Large Language Model (LLM) describing the categories of interest and effectively substituting labeled visual instances of those categories. Using our label-free approach, we are able to attain significant performance improvements over the zero-shot performance of the base VL model and other contemporary methods and baselines on a wide variety of datasets, demonstrating absolute improvement of up to $11.7\\%$ ($3.8\\%$ on average) in the label-free setting. Moreover, despite our approach being label-free, we observe $1.3\\%$ average gains over leading few-shot prompting baselines that do use 5-shot supervision.",
    "LayoutGPT Compositional Visual Planning and Generation with Large Language Models": "Attaining a high degree of user controllability in visual generation often requires intricate, fine-grained inputs like layouts. However, such inputs impose a substantial burden on users when compared to simple text inputs. To address the issue, we study how Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as visual planners by generating layouts from text conditions, and thus collaborate with visual generative models. We propose LayoutGPT, a method to compose in-context visual demonstrations in style sheet language to enhance visual planning skills of LLMs. We show that LayoutGPT can generate plausible layouts in multiple domains, ranging from 2D images to 3D indoor scenes. LayoutGPT also shows superior performance in converting challenging language concepts like numerical and spatial relations to layout arrangements for faithful text-to-image generation. When combined with a downstream image generation model, LayoutGPT outperforms text-to-image models/systems by 20-40\\% and achieves comparable performance as human users in designing visual layouts for numerical and spatial correctness. Lastly, LayoutGPT achieves comparable performance to supervised methods in 3D indoor scene synthesis, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential in multiple visual domains.",
    "Symbol-LLM Leverage Language Models for Symbolic System in Visual Human Activity Reasoning": "Human reasoning can be understood as a cooperation between the intuitive, associative \"System-1'' and the deliberative, logical \"System-2''. For existing System-1-like methods in visual activity understanding, it is crucial to integrate System-2 processing to improve explainability, generalization, and data efficiency. One possible path of activity reasoning is building a symbolic system composed of symbols and rules, where one rule connects multiple symbols, implying human knowledge and reasoning abilities.\nPrevious methods have made progress, but are defective with limited symbols from handcraft and limited rules from visual-based annotations, failing to cover the complex patterns of activities and lacking compositional generalization. \nTo overcome the defects, we propose a new symbolic system with two ideal important properties: broad-coverage symbols and rational rules. Collecting massive human knowledge via manual annotations is expensive to instantiate this symbolic system. Instead, we leverage the recent advancement of LLMs (Large Language Models) as an approximation of the two ideal properties, i.e., Symbols from Large Language Models (Symbol-LLM). \nThen, given an image, visual contents from the images are extracted and\nchecked as symbols and activity semantics are reasoned out based on rules via fuzzy logic calculation.\nOur method shows superiority in extensive activity understanding tasks. Code and data are available at https://mvig-rhos.com/symbol_llm.",
    "CoVR Learning Composed Video Retrieval from Web Video Captions": "Composed Image Retrieval (CoIR) has recently gained popularity as a task that considers both text and image queries together, to search for relevant images in a database. Most CoIR approaches require manually annotated datasets, containing image-text-image triplets, where the text describes a modification from the query image to the target image. However, manual curation of CoIR triplets is expensive and prevents scalability. In this work, we instead propose a scalable automatic dataset creation methodology that generates triplets given video-caption pairs. To this end, we mine paired videos with a similar caption from a large database, and leverage a large language model to generate the corresponding modification text. We automatically construct our WebVid-CoVR dataset by applying this procedure to the large WebVid2M collection, resulting in 1.6M triplets. Moreover, we introduce a new benchmark for composed video retrieval (CoVR) and contribute a manually annotated evaluation set, along with baseline results. We further show that training a CoVR model on our dataset transfers well to CoIR, improving the state of the art in the zero-shot setup on both the CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks. Our code, datasets, and models will be made publicly available",
    "On the Planning Abilities of Large Language Models - A Critical Investigation": "Intrigued by the claims of emergent reasoning capabilities in LLMs trained on general web corpora, in this paper, we set out to investigate their planning capabilities. We aim to evaluate (1) the effectiveness of LLMs in generating plans autonomously in commonsense planning tasks and (2) the potential of LLMs as a source of heuristic guidance for other agents (AI planners) in their planning tasks. We conduct a systematic study by generating a suite of instances on domains similar to the ones employed in the International Planning Competition and evaluate LLMs in two distinct modes: autonomous and heuristic. Our findings reveal that LLMs’ ability to generate executable plans autonomously is rather limited, with the best model (GPT-4) having an average success rate of ~12% across the domains. However, the results in the heuristic mode show more promise. In the heuristic mode, we demonstrate that LLM-generated plans can improve the search process for underlying sound planners and additionally show that external verifiers can help provide feedback on the generated plans and back-prompt the LLM for better plan generation.",
    "SPAE Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder for Multimodal Generation with Frozen LLMs": "In this work, we introduce Semantic Pyramid AutoEncoder (SPAE) for enabling frozen LLMs to perform both understanding and generation tasks involving non-linguistic modalities such as images or videos. SPAE converts between raw pixels and interpretable lexical tokens (or words) extracted from the LLM's vocabulary. The resulting tokens capture both the rich semantic meaning and the fine-grained details needed for visual reconstruction, effectively translating the visual content into a language comprehensible to the LLM, and empowering it to perform a wide array of multimodal tasks. Our approach is validated through in-context learning experiments with frozen PaLM 2 and GPT 3.5 on a diverse set of image understanding and generation tasks.\nOur method marks the first successful attempt to enable a frozen LLM to generate image content while surpassing state-of-the-art performance in image understanding tasks, under the same setting, by over 25%."
