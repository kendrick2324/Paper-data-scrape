    "Dr.Spider A Diagnostic Evaluation Benchmark towards Text-to-SQL Robustness": "Neural text-to-SQL models have achieved remarkable performance in translating natural language questions into SQL queries. However, recent studies reveal that text-to-SQL models are vulnerable to task-specific perturbations. Previous curated robustness test sets usually focus on individual phenomena. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive robustness benchmark based on Spider, a cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmark, to diagnose the model robustness. We design 17 perturbations on databases, natural language questions, and SQL queries to measure the robustness from different angles. In order to collect more diversified natural question perturbations, we utilize large pretrained language models (PLMs) to simulate human behaviors in creating natural questions. We conduct a diagnostic study of the state-of-the-art models on the robustness set. Experimental results reveal that even the most robust model suffers from a 14.0% performance drop overall and a 50.7% performance drop on the most challenging perturbation. We also present a breakdown analysis regarding text-to-SQL model designs and provide insights for improving model robustness.",
    "Promptagator Few-shot Dense Retrieval From 8 Examples": "Much recent research on information retrieval has focused on how to transfer from one task (typically with abundant supervised data) to various other retrieval tasks where supervision is limited, with the implicit assumption that it is possible to generalize from one task to all the rest. However, this overlooks the fact that there are many diverse and unique retrieval problems, each targeting different search intents, queries, and search domains. In this paper, we suggest to work on Few-shot Dense Retrieval, a setting where each task comes with a short description and a few examples. To address this, we introduce Prompt-based Query Generation forRetrieval (Promptagator): for each task, we feed the few-shot examples to a large language model (LLM) and prompt it to behave as a task-specific query generator. Using this, we can synthetically generate a large number of relevant queries for any document, yielding abundant data for training task-specific retrievers --- with no reliance on traditional resources such as Natural Questions (Kwiatkowskiet al., 2019) or MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016). Surprisingly, Promptagator with only 8 annotated examples enables efficient dual encoder retrievers to outperform computationally more expensive models trained on MS MARCO such as ColBERT v2 (Santhanam et al., 2022) by more than 1.2 points nDCG@10 on average on 11 retrieval sets. Further training standard-size re-rankers using the same generated data yields another 5.0 points nDCG@10 improvement. Our studies show that synthetic query generation can be far more effective than previously observed, especially when a small amount of task-specific knowledge is given.",
    "Language Models are Realistic Tabular Data Generators": "Tabular data is among the oldest and most ubiquitous forms of data. However, the generation of synthetic samples with the original data’s characteristics remains a significant challenge for tabular data. While many generative models from the computer vision domain, such as variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks, have been adapted for tabular data generation, less research has been directed towards recent transformer-based large language models (LLMs), which are also generative in nature. To this end, we propose GReaT (Generation of Realistic Tabular data), which exploits an auto-regressive generative LLM to sample synthetic and yet highly realistic tabular data. Furthermore, GReaT can model tabular data distributions by conditioning on any subset of features; the remaining features are sampled without additional overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a series of experiments that quantify the validity and quality of the produced data samples from multiple angles. We find that GReaT maintains state-of-the-art performance across numerous real-world and synthetic data sets with heterogeneous feature types coming in various sizes.",
    "Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Program Better": "Recent Language Models (LMs) achieve breakthrough performance in code generation when trained on human-authored problems, even solving some competitive-programming problems. Self-play has proven useful in games such as Go, and thus it is natural to ask whether LMs can generate their own instructive programming problems to improve their performance. We show that it is possible for an LM to synthesize programming problems and solutions, which are filtered for correctness by a Python interpreter. The LM’s performance is then seen to improve when it is fine-tuned on its own synthetic problems and verified solutions; thus the model “improves itself” using the Python interpreter. Problems are specified formally as programming puzzles [Schuster et al. , 2021], a code-based problem format where solutions can easily be verified for correctness by execution. In experiments on publicly-available LMs, test accuracy more than doubles. This work demonstrates the potential for code LMs, with an interpreter, to generate instructive problems and improve their own performance.",
    "ImaginaryNet Learning Object Detectors without Real Images and Annotations": "Without the demand of training in reality, humans are able of detecting a new category of object simply based on the language description on its visual characteristics. Empowering deep learning with this ability undoubtedly enables the neural network to handle complex vision tasks, e.g., object detection, without collecting and annotating real images. To this end, this paper introduces a novel challenging learning paradigm Imaginary-Supervised Object Detection (ISOD), where neither real images nor manual annotations are allowed for training object detectors. To resolve this challenge, we propose ImaginaryNet, a framework to synthesize images by combining pretrained language model and text-to-image synthesis model. Given a class label, the language model is used to generate a full description of a scene with a target object, and the text-to-image model is deployed to generate a photo-realistic image. With the synthesized images and class labels, weakly supervised object detection can then be leveraged to accomplish ISOD. By gradually introducing real images and manual annotations, ImaginaryNet can collaborate with other supervision settings to further boost detection performance. Experiments show that ImaginaryNet can (i) obtain about 75% performance in ISOD compared with the weakly supervised counterpart of the same backbone trained on real data, (ii) significantly improve the baseline while achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance by incorporating ImaginaryNet with other supervision settings.  Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/kodenii/ImaginaryNet.",
    "MolJET Multimodal Joint Embedding Transformer for Conditional de novo Molecular Design and Multi-Property Optimization": "Multi-property constrained optimization of molecules using generative de novo design models is vital for the successful application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) towards materials and drug discovery. Yet there remains a gap between the reported performance of such models in the literature and their practical utility in real world design scenarios. Furthermore, existing models are largely inaccessible to chemists without an extensive background in computer science. To address these challenges, we propose a generative foundation model, the Multimodal Joint Embedding Transformer (MolJET), which performs conditional generation of desired molecular distributions based on human-interpretable chemistry prompts in a zero-shot manner. We assess MolJET on the standard benchmarks available in the GuacaMol and MIMOSA evaluation frameworks. These include structure-based sampling tasks as well as a range of multi-property optimization tasks that probe a models ability to design drug-like molecules given realistic property constraints. We demonstrate that with self-supervised pretraining, MolJET outperforms 80% of task-optimized models while using zero-shot inferences and beats all baselines after minimal supervision. Moreover, the performance of MolJET on text-only conditioning tasks improves with the inclusion of property modalities during training, highlighting the importance of a multimodal approach to molecular design. MolJET is the first example of text-based de novo molecular design using large-scale multimodal foundation models and should serve as a building block towards further improvements to accessible AI for chemists.",
    "Differentially Private Conditional Text Generation For Synthetic Data Production": "Companies have faced increasing pressure in recent years to anonymize user collected data when sharing internally or to third parties. Text data in particular contains copious amounts of personally identifiable information that has proven to be difficult to de-identify while remain useful for the party of interest. Previous works have suggested that synthetic text generation could provide a promising avenue to curate high performant and private datasets. In this paper, we introduce an approach to synthesize high utility text classification datasets by performing conditional generation through a large language model, distilGPT2, while providing measurable guarantees via differential privacy. We show that naive approaches suffer heavily from utility loss by entangling task-relevant factors in the transformer embedding space, making controlled generation more difficult. We analyze how incorporating a secondary learning objective can improve the performance of the generative model, improving utility of the generated data.",
    "Meta-Weighted Language Model Tuning for Augmentation-Enhanced Few-Shot Learning": "Recent studies have revealed the intriguing few-shot learning ability of pretrained language models (PLMs): They can quickly adapt to a new task when fine-tuned on a small amount of labeled data formulated as prompts, without requiring abundant task-specific annotations. Despite their promising performance, most existing few-shot approaches that only learn from the small training set still underperform fully supervised training by nontrivial margins. In this work, we study few-shot learning with PLMs from a different perspective: We first tune an autoregressive PLM on the few-shot samples and then use it as a generator to synthesize a large amount of novel training samples which augment the original training set. To encourage the generator to produce label-discriminative samples, we train it via weighted maximum likelihood where the weight of each token is automatically adjusted based on a discriminative meta-learning objective. A classification PLM can then be fine-tuned on both the few-shot and the synthetic samples with regularization for better generalization and stability. Our approach FewGen achieves an overall better result across seven classification tasks of the GLUE benchmark than existing few-shot learning methods.",
    "Contrastive Novelty Learning Anticipating Outliers with Large Language Models": "In many task settings, text classification models are likely to encounter examples from novel classes on which they cannot predict correctly. Selective prediction, in which models abstain on low-confidence examples, provides a possible solution, but existing models are often overly confident on OOD examples. To remedy this overconfidence, we introduce Contrastive Novelty Learning (CNL), a two-step method that generates OOD examples representative of novel classes, then trains to decrease confidence on them. First, we generate OOD examples by prompting a large language model twice: we prompt it to enumerate novel classes relevant to the label set, then generate examples from each novel class matching the task format. Second, we train our classifier with a novel contrastive objective that encourages lower confidence on generated OOD examples than training examples. When trained with CNL, classifiers improve in their ability to detect and abstain on OOD examples over prior methods by an average of 2.3% AUAC and 5.5% AUROC across 4 NLP datasets, with no cost to in-distribution accuracy.",
    "What does a platypus look like Generating customized prompts for zero-shot image classification": "Open vocabulary models are a promising new paradigm for image classification. Unlike traditional classification models, open vocabulary models classify among any arbitrary set of categories specified with natural language during inference. This natural language, called \"prompts\", typically consists of a set of hand-written templates (e.g., \"a photo of a {}”) which are completed with each of the category names. This work introduces a simple method to generate higher accuracy prompts, without relying on any explicit knowledge of the task domain and with far fewer hand-constructed sentences. To achieve this, we combine open vocabulary models with large language models (LLMs) to create Customized Prompts via Language models (CuPL, pronounced \"couple\"). In particular, we leverage the knowledge contained in LLMs in order to generate many descriptive sentences that are customized for each object category. We find that this straightforward and general approach improves accuracy on a range of zero-shot image classification benchmarks, including over one percentage point gain on ImageNet. Finally, this simple baseline requires no additional training and remains completely zero-shot.",
    "Human-Guided Fair Classification for Natural Language Processing": "Text classifiers have promising applications in high-stake tasks such as resume screening and content moderation. These classifiers must be fair and avoid discriminatory decisions by being invariant to perturbations of sensitive attributes such as gender or ethnicity. However, there is a gap between human intuition about these perturbations and the formal similarity specifications capturing them. While existing research has started to address this gap, current methods are based on hardcoded word replacements, resulting in specifications with limited expressivity or ones that fail to fully align with human intuition (e.g., in cases of asymmetric counterfactuals). This work proposes novel methods for bridging this gap by discovering expressive and intuitive individual fairness specifications. We show how to leverage unsupervised style transfer and GPT-3's zero-shot capabilities to automatically generate expressive candidate pairs of semantically similar sentences that differ along sensitive attributes. We then validate the generated pairs via an extensive crowdsourcing study, which confirms that a lot of these pairs align with human intuition about fairness in the context of toxicity classification. Finally, we show how limited amounts of human feedback can be leveraged to learn a similarity specification that can be used to train downstream fairness-aware models. ",
    "Self-Guided Noise-Free Data Generation for Efficient Zero-Shot Learning": "There is a rising interest in further exploring the zero-shot learning potential of large pre-trained language models (PLMs). A new paradigm called data-generation-based zero-shot learning has achieved impressive success. In this paradigm, the synthesized data from the PLM acts as the carrier of knowledge, which is used to train a task-specific model with orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the PLM, achieving both higher performance and efficiency than prompt-based zero-shot learning methods on PLMs. The main hurdle of this approach is that the synthesized data from PLM usually contains a significant portion of low-quality samples. Fitting on such data will greatly hamper the performance of the task-specific model, making it unreliable for deployment. Previous methods remedy this issue mainly by filtering synthetic data using heuristic metrics(e.g., output confidence), or refining the data with the help of a human expert, which comes with excessive manual tuning or expensive costs. In this paper, we propose a novel noise-robust re-weighting framework SunGen to automatically construct high-quality data for zero-shot classification problems. Our framework features the ability to learn the sample weights indicating data quality without requiring any human annotation. We theoretically and empirically verify the ability of our method to help construct good-quality synthetic datasets. Notably, SunGen-LSTM yields a 9.8% relative improvement than the baseline on average accuracy across eight different established text classification tasks."
