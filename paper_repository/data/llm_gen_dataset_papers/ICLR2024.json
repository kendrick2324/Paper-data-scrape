    "LEGO-Prover Neural Theorem Proving with Growing Libraries": "Despite the success of large language models (LLMs), the task of theorem proving still remains one of the hardest reasoning tasks that is far from being fully solved. Prior methods using language models have demonstrated promising results, but they still struggle to prove even middle school level theorems. One common limitation of these methods is that they assume a fixed theorem library during the whole theorem proving process. However, as we all know, creating new useful theorems or even new theories is not only helpful but crucial and necessary for advancing mathematics and proving harder and deeper results. In this work, we present LEGO-Prover, which employs a growing skill library containing verified lemmas as skills to augment the capability of LLMs used in theorem proving. By constructing the proof modularly, LEGO-Prover enables LLMs to utilize existing skills retrieved from the library and to create new skills during the proving process. These skills are further evolved (by prompting an LLM) to enrich the library on another scale. Modular and reusable skills are constantly added to the library to enable tackling increasingly intricate mathematical problems. Moreover, the learned library further bridges the gap between human proofs and formal proofs by making it easier to impute missing steps. LEGO-Prover advances the state-of-the-art pass rate on miniF2F-valid (48.0\\% to 57.0\\%) and miniF2F-test (45.5\\% to 50.0\\%). During the proving process, LEGO-Prover also generates over 20,000 skills (theorems/lemmas) and adds them to the growing library. Our ablation study indicates that these newly added skills are indeed helpful for proving theorems, resulting in a 4.9\\% improvement in success rate",
    "Dissecting learning and forgetting in language model finetuning": "Finetuning language models on domain-specific corpus is a common approach to enhance their domain knowledge and capability. While improving performance on domain tasks, it often brings a side-effect of forgetting of the model's general abilities. In this study, we analyze the effects of finetuning on language models by dissecting its impacts on the modeling of topic, style, and factual knowledge in text. Our method uses instruction-following LLMs such as ChatGPT to auto-generate controlled-variable text examples which we use to probe the model. Our findings reveal that finetuning results in significant shifts in the language model's topic and style priors, while actual knowledge learning only contributes to a small fraction of the total probability change. Analysis shows that the adaptation of topic and style priors behave akin to learning simple features: they are learned rapidly and require little model capacity. They are also learned independently and primarily at the beginning of a text sequence. In contrast, factual knowledge is learned stably but slowly and requires significant model capacity to learn. The research offers insights and understanding into the finer dynamics of learning and forgetting in language models, and can potentially inform future research on improving domain adaptation and addressing the challenges of forgetting in continual learning of language models.",
    "Mitigating Hallucination in Large Multi-Modal Models via Robust Instruction Tuning": "Despite the promising progress in multi-modal tasks, current large multi-modal models (LMMs) are prone to hallucinating inconsistent descriptions with respect to the associated image and human instructions. This paper addresses this issue by introducing the first large and diverse visual instruction tuning dataset, named Large-scale Robust Visual (LRV)-Instruction. Our dataset comprises 400k visual\ninstructions generated by GPT4, covering 16 vision-and-language tasks with open-ended instructions and answers. Unlike existing studies that primarily focus on positive instruction samples, we design LRV-Instruction to include both positive and negative instructions for more robust visual instruction tuning. Our negative instructions are designed at three semantic levels: (i) Nonexistent Object Manipulation, (ii) Existent Object Manipulation and (iii) Knowledge Manipulation. To efficiently measure the hallucination generated by LMMs, we propose GPT4-Assisted Visual Instruction Evaluation (GAVIE), a stable approach to evaluate visual instruction tuning like human experts. GAVIE does not require human-annotated groundtruth answers and can adapt to diverse instruction formats. We conduct comprehensive experiments to investigate the hallucination of LMMs. Our results demonstrate existing LMMs exhibit significant hallucinations when presented with our negative instructions, particularly Existent Object and Knowledge Manipulation instructions. Moreover, we successfully mitigate hallucination by finetuning MiniGPT4 and mPLUG-Owl on LRV-Instruction while improving performance on several public\ndatasets compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we observed that a balanced ratio of positive and negative instances in the training data leads to a more robust model. Code and data will be released upon publication.",
    "Kosmos-G Generating Images in Context with Multimodal Large Language Models": "Recent advancements in subject-driven image generation have made significant strides. However, current methods still fall short in diverse application scenarios, as they require test-time tuning and cannot accept interleaved multi-image and text input. These limitations keep them far from the ultimate goal of \"image as a foreign language in image generation.\" This paper presents Kosmos-G, a model that leverages the advanced multimodal perception capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to tackle the aforementioned challenge. Our approach aligns the output space of MLLM with CLIP using the textual modality as an anchor and performs compositional instruction tuning on curated data. Kosmos-G demonstrates an impressive capability of zero-shot subject-driven generation with interleaved multi-image and text input. Notably, the score distillation instruction tuning requires no modifications to the image decoder. This allows for a seamless substitution of CLIP and effortless integration with a myriad of U-Net techniques ranging from fine-grained controls to personalized image decoder variants. We posit Kosmos-G as an initial attempt towards the goal of \"image as a foreign language in image generation.\"",
    "Large Language Models as Automated Aligners for  benchmarking  Vision-Language Models": "With the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have reached a new level of sophistication, showing notable competence in executing intricate cognition and reasoning tasks. However, existing evaluation benchmarks, primarily relying on rigid, hand-crafted datasets to measure task-specific performance, face significant limitations in assessing the alignment of these increasingly anthropomorphic models with human intelligence. In this work, we address the limitations via Auto-Bench, which delves into exploring LLMs as proficient aligners, measuring the alignment between VLMs and human intelligence and value through automatic data curation and assessment. Specifically, for data curation, Auto-Bench utilizes LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to automatically generate a vast set of question-answer-reasoning triplets via prompting on visual symbolic representations (e.g., captions, object locations, instance relationships, and etc. The curated data closely matches human intent, owing to the extensive world knowledge embedded in LLMs. Through this pipeline, a total of 28.5K human-verified and 3,504K unfiltered question-answer-reasoning triplets have been curated, covering 4 primary abilities and 16 sub-abilities. We subsequently engage LLMs like GPT-3.5 to serve as judges, implementing the quantitative and qualitative automated assessments to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs. Our validation results reveal that LLMs are proficient in both evaluation data curation and model assessment, achieving an average agreement rate of 85%. We envision Auto-Bench as a flexible, scalable, and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the evolving sophisticated VLMs.",
    "AutomaTikZ Text-Guided Synthesis of Scientific Vector Graphics with TikZ": "Generating bitmap graphics from text has gained considerable attention, yet for scientific figures, vector graphics are often preferred. Given that vector graphics are typically encoded using low-level graphics primitives, generating them directly is difficult. To address this, we propose the use of TikZ, a well-known abstract graphics language that can be compiled to vector graphics, as an intermediate representation of scientific figures. TikZ offers human-oriented, high-level commands, thereby facilitating conditional language modeling with any large language model. To this end, we introduce DaTikZ the first large-scale TikZ dataset, consisting of 120k TikZ drawings aligned with captions. We fine-tune LLaMA on DaTikZ, as well as our new model CLiMA, which augments LLaMA with multimodal CLIP embeddings. In both human and automatic evaluation, CLiMA and LLaMA outperform commercial GPT-4 and Claude 2 in terms of similarity to human-created figures, with CLiMA additionally improving text-image alignment. Our detailed analysis shows that all models generalize well and are not susceptible to memorization. GPT-4 and Claude 2, however, tend to generate more simplistic figures compared to both humans and our models. We make our framework, AutomaTikZ, along with model weights and datasets, publicly available.",
    "InstructCV Instruction-Tuned Text-to-Image Diffusion Models as Vision Generalists": "Recent advances in generative diffusion models have enabled text-controlled synthesis of realistic and diverse images with impressive quality. Despite these remarkable advances, the application of text-to-image generative models in computer vision for standard visual recognition tasks remains limited. The current de facto approach for these tasks is to design model architectures and loss functions that are tailored to the task at hand. In this paper, we develop a unified language interface for computer vision tasks that abstracts away task specific design choices and enables task execution by following natural language instructions. Our approach involves casting multiple computer vision tasks as text-to-image generation problems. Here, the text represents an instruction describing the task, and the resulting image is a visually-encoded task output. To train our model, we pool commonly-used computer vision datasets covering a range of tasks, including segmentation, object detection, depth estimation, and classification. We then use a large language model to paraphrase prompt templates that convey the specific tasks to be conducted on each image, and through this process, we create a multi-modal and multi-task training dataset comprising input and output images along with annotated instructions. Following the InstructPix2Pix architecture, we apply instruction-tuning to a text-to-image diffusion model using our constructed dataset, steering its functionality from a generative model to an instruction-guided multi-task vision learner. Experiments demonstrate that our model, dubbed InstructCV, performs competitively compared to other generalist and task-specific vision models. Moreover, it exhibits compelling generalization capabilities to unseen data, categories, and user instructions.",
    "Language-Interfaced Tabular Oversampling via Progressive Imputation and Self-Authentication": "Tabular data in the wild are frequently afflicted with class-imbalance, biasing machine learning model predictions towards major classes. A data-centric solution to this problem is oversampling - where the classes are balanced by adding synthetic minority samples via generative methods. However, although tabular generative models are capable of generating synthetic samples under a balanced distribution, their integrity suffers when the number of minority samples is low. To this end, pre-trained generative language models with rich prior knowledge are a fitting candidate for the task at hand. Nevertheless, an oversampling strategy tailored for tabular data that utilizes the extensive capabilities of such language models is yet to emerge. In this paper, we propose a novel oversampling framework for tabular data to channel the abilities of generative language models. By leveraging its conditional sampling capabilities, we synthesize minority samples by progressively masking the important features of the majority class samples and imputing them towards the minority distribution. To reduce the inclusion of imperfectly converted samples, we utilize the power of the language model itself to self-authenticate the labels of the samples generated by itself, sifting out ill-converted samples. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets and imbalance ratios reveal that the proposed method successfully generates reliable minority samples to boost the performance of machine learning classifiers, even under heavy imbalance ratios.",
    "WizardLM Empowering Large Pre-Trained Language Models to Follow Complex Instructions": "Training large language models (LLMs) with open-domain instruction following data brings colossal success. However, manually creating such instruction data is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, humans may struggle to produce high-complexity instructions. In this paper, we show an avenue for creating large amounts of instruction data with varying levels of complexity using LLM instead of humans. Starting with an initial set of instructions, we use our proposed Evol-Instruct to rewrite them step by step into more complex instructions. Then, we mix all generated instruction data to fine-tune LLaMA. We call the resulting model WizardLM. Both automatic and human evaluations consistently indicate that WizardLM outperforms baselines such as Alpaca (trained from Self-Instruct) and Vicuna (trained from human-created instructions). The experimental results demonstrate that the quality of instruction-following dataset crafted by Evol-Instruct can significantly improve the performance of LLMs.",
    "LLM Blueprint Enabling Text-to-Image Generation with Complex and Detailed Prompts": "Diffusion-based generative models have significantly advanced text-to-image generation but encounter challenges when processing lengthy and intricate text prompts describing complex scenes with multiple objects. While excelling in generating images from short, single-object descriptions, these models often struggle to faithfully capture all the nuanced details within longer and more elaborate textual inputs. In response, we present a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract critical components from text prompts, including bounding box coordinates for foreground objects, detailed textual descriptions for individual objects, and a succinct background context. These components form the foundation of our layout-to-image generation model, which operates in two phases. The initial Global Scene Generation utilizes object layouts and background context to create an initial scene but often falls short in faithfully representing object characteristics as specified in the prompts. To address this limitation, we introduce an Iterative Refinement Scheme that iteratively evaluates and refines box-level content to align them with their textual descriptions, recomposing objects as needed to ensure consistency. Our evaluation on complex prompts featuring multiple objects demonstrates a substantial improvement in recall compared to baseline diffusion models. This is further validated by a user study, underscoring the efficacy of our approach in generating coherent and detailed scenes from intricate textual inputs. Our iterative framework offers a promising solution for enhancing text-to-image generation models' fidelity with lengthy, multifaceted descriptions, opening new possibilities for accurate and diverse image synthesis from textual inputs.",
    "Ins-DetCLIP Aligning Detection Model to Follow Human-Language Instruction": "This paper introduces Instruction-oriented Object Detection (IOD), a new task that enhances human-computer interaction by enabling object detectors to understand user instructions and locate relevant objects. Unlike traditional open-vocabulary object detection tasks that rely on users providing a list of required category names, IOD requires models to comprehend natural-language instructions, contextual reasoning, and output the name and location of the desired categories. This poses fresh challenges for modern object detection systems. To develop an IOD system, we create a dataset called IOD-Bench, which consists of instruction-guided detections, along with specialized evaluation metrics. We leverage large-scale language models (LLMs) to generate a diverse set of instructions (8k+) based on existing public object detection datasets, covering a wide range of real-world scenarios. As an initial approach to the IOD task, we propose a model called Ins-DetCLIP. It harnesses the extensive knowledge within LLMs to empower the detector with instruction-following capabilities. Specifically, our Ins-DetCLIP employs a visual encoder (i.e., DetCLIP, an open-vocabulary detector) to extract object-level features. These features are then aligned with the input instructions using a cross-modal fusion module integrated into a pre-trained LLM. Experimental results conducted on IOD-Bench demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms baseline methods that directly combine LLMs with detection models. This research aims to pave the way for a more adaptable and versatile interaction paradigm in modern object detection systems, making a significant contribution to the field.",
    "Privacy-Preserving In-Context Learning with Differentially Private Few-Shot Generation": "We study the problem of in-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) on private datasets. \nThis scenario poses privacy risks, as LLMs may leak or regurgitate the private examples demonstrated in the prompt.\nWe propose a novel algorithm that generates synthetic few-shot demonstrations from the private dataset with formal differential privacy (DP) guarantees, and show empirically that it can achieve effective ICL.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and compare our algorithm with non-private ICL and zero-shot solutions. \nOur results demonstrate that our algorithm can achieve competitive performance with strong privacy levels.\nThese results open up new possibilities for ICL with privacy protection for a broad range of applications.",
    "MathCoder Seamless Code Integration in LLMs for Enhanced Mathematical Reasoning": "The recently released GPT-4 Code Interpreter has demonstrated remarkable proficiency in solving challenging math problems, primarily attributed to its ability to seamlessly reason with natural language, generate code, execute code, and continue reasoning based on the execution output. In this paper, we present a method to fine-tune open-source language models, enabling them to use code for modeling and deriving math equations and, consequently, enhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities. We propose a method of generating novel and high-quality datasets with math problems and their code-based solutions, referred to as MathCodeInstruct. Each solution interleaves $\\textit{natural language}$, $\\textit{code}$, and $\\textit{execution results}$. We also introduce a customized supervised fine-tuning and inference approach. This approach yields the MathCoder models, a family of models capable of generating code-based solutions for solving challenging math problems. Impressively, the MathCoder models achieve state-of-the-art scores among open-source LLMs on the MATH (45.2%) and GSM8K (83.9%) datasets, substantially outperforming other open-source alternatives. Notably, the MathCoder model not only surpasses ChatGPT-3.5 and PaLM-2 on GSM8K and MATH but also outperforms GPT-4 on the competition-level MATH dataset. The proposed dataset and models will be released upon acceptance.",
    "Follow-Up Differential Descriptions Language Models Resolve Ambiguities for Image Classification": "A promising approach for improving the performance of vision-language models like CLIP for image classification is to extend the class descriptions (i.e., prompts) with related attributes, e.g., using brown sparrow instead of sparrow. However, current zero-shot methods select a subset of attributes regardless of commonalities between the target classes, potentially providing no useful information that would have helped to distinguish between them. For instance, they may use color instead of bill shape to distinguish between sparrows and wrens, which are both brown. We propose Follow-up Differential Descriptions (FuDD), a zero-shot approach that tailors the class descriptions to each dataset and leads to additional attributes that better differentiate the target classes. FuDD first identifies the ambiguous classes for each image, and then uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate new class descriptions that differentiate between them. The new class descriptions resolve the initial ambiguity and help predict the correct label. In our experiments, FuDD consistently outperforms generic description ensembles and naive LLM-generated descriptions on 12 datasets. We show that differential descriptions are an effective tool to resolve class ambiguities, which otherwise significantly degrade the performance. We also show that high quality natural language class descriptions produced by FuDD result in comparable performance to few-shot adaptation methods.",
    "Domain-Agnostic Molecular Generation with Chemical Feedback": "The generation of molecules with desired properties has become increasingly popular, revolutionizing the way scientists design molecular structures and providing valuable support for chemical and drug design. However, despite the potential of language models in molecule generation, they face challenges such as generating syntactically or chemically flawed molecules, having narrow domain focus, and struggling to create diverse and feasible molecules due to limited annotated data or external molecular databases.\nTo tackle these challenges, we introduce MolGen, a pre-trained molecular language model tailored specifically for molecule generation. Through the reconstruction of over 100 million molecular SELFIES, MolGen internalizes structural and grammatical insights. This is further enhanced by domain-agnostic molecular prefix tuning, fostering robust knowledge transfer across diverse domains. Importantly, our chemical feedback paradigm steers the model away from \"molecular hallucinations\", ensuring alignment between the model's estimated probabilities and real-world chemical preferences. Extensive experiments on well-known benchmarks underscore MolGen's optimization capabilities in properties such as penalized logP, QED, and molecular docking. Additional analyses confirm its proficiency in accurately capturing molecule distributions, discerning intricate structural patterns, and efficiently exploring the chemical space (https://github.com/zjunlp/MolGen).",
    "LLM-grounded Video Diffusion Models": "Text-conditioned diffusion models have emerged as a promising tool for neural video generation. However, current models still struggle with intricate spatiotemporal prompts and often generate restricted or incorrect motion. To address these limitations, we introduce LLM-grounded Video Diffusion (LVD). Instead of directly generating videos from the text inputs, LVD first leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate dynamic scene layouts based on the text inputs and subsequently uses the generated layouts to guide a diffusion model for video generation. We show that LLMs are able to understand complex spatiotemporal dynamics from text alone and generate layouts that align closely with both the prompts and the object motion patterns typically observed in the real world. We then propose to guide video diffusion models with these layouts by adjusting the attention maps. Our approach is training-free and can be integrated into any video diffusion model that admits classifier guidance. Our results demonstrate that LVD significantly outperforms its base video diffusion model and several strong baseline methods in faithfully generating videos with the desired attributes and motion patterns.",
    "Are Human-generated Demonstrations Necessary for In-context Learning": "Despite the promising few-shot ability of large language models (LLMs), the standard paradigm of In-context Learning (ICL) suffers the disadvantages of susceptibility to selected demonstrations and the intricacy to generate these demonstrations. In this paper, we raise the fundamental question that whether human-generated demonstrations are necessary for ICL. To answer this question, we propose self-contemplation prompting strategy (SEC), a paradigm free from human-crafted demonstrations. The key point of SEC is that, instead of using hand-crafted examples as demonstrations in ICL, SEC asks LLMs to first create demonstrations on their own, based on which the final output is generated. SEC is a flexible framework and can be adapted to both the vanilla ICL and the chain-of-thought (CoT), but with greater ease: as the manual-generation process of both examples and rationale can be saved. Extensive experiments in arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, multi-task language understanding, and code generation benchmarks, show that SEC, which does not require hand-crafted demonstrations, significantly outperforms the zero-shot learning strategy, and achieves comparable results to ICL with hand-crafted demonstrations. This demonstrates that, for many tasks, contemporary LLMs possess a sufficient level of competence to exclusively depend on their own capacity for decision making, removing the need for external training data.",
    "Trajeglish Traffic Modeling as Next-Token Prediction": "A longstanding challenge for self-driving development is simulating dynamic driving scenarios seeded from recorded driving logs. In pursuit of this functionality, we apply tools from discrete sequence modeling to model how vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists interact in driving scenarios. Using a simple data-driven tokenization scheme, we discretize trajectories to centimeter-level resolution using a small vocabulary. We then model the multi-agent sequence of discrete motion tokens with a GPT-like encoder-decoder that is autoregressive in time and takes into account intra-timestep interaction between agents. Scenarios sampled from our model exhibit state-of-the-art realism; our model tops the Waymo Sim Agents Benchmark, surpassing prior work along the realism meta metric by 3.3% and along the interaction metric by 9.9%. We ablate our modeling choices in full autonomy and partial autonomy settings, and show that the representations learned by our model can quickly be adapted to improve performance on nuScenes. We additionally evaluate the scalability of our model with respect to parameter count and dataset size, and use density estimates from our model to quantify the saliency of context length and intra-timestep interaction for the traffic modeling task.",
    "InstructDET Diversifying Referring Object Detection with Generalized Instructions": "We propose InstructDET, a data-centric method for referring object detection (ROD) that localizes target objects based on user instructions. While deriving from referring expressions (REC), the instructions we leverage are greatly diversified to encompass common user intentions related to object detection. For one image, we produce tremendous instructions that refer to every single object and different combinations of multiple objects. Each instruction and its corresponding object bounding boxes (bbxs) constitute one training data pair. In order to encompass common detection expressions, we involve emerging vision-language model (VLM) and large language model (LLM) to generate instructions guided by text prompts and object bbxs, as the generalizations of foundation models are effective to produce human-like expressions (e.g., describing object property, category, and relationship). We name our constructed dataset as InDET. It contains images, bbxs and generalized instructions that are from foundation models. Our InDET is developed from existing REC datasets and object detection datasets, with the expanding potential that any image with object bbxs can be incorporated through using our InstructDET method. By using our InDET dataset, we show that a conventional ROD model surpasses existing methods on standard REC datasets and our InDET test set. Our data-centric method InstructDET, with automatic data expansion by leveraging foundation models, directs a promising field that ROD can be greatly diversified to execute common object detection instructions.",
    "PromptTTS 2 Describing and Generating Voices with Text Prompt": "Speech conveys more information than text, as the same word can be uttered in various voices to convey diverse information. Compared to traditional text-to-speech (TTS) methods relying on speech prompts (reference speech) for voice variability, using text prompts (descriptions) is more user-friendly since speech prompts can be hard to find or may not exist at all. TTS approaches based on the text prompt face two main challenges: 1) the one-to-many problem, where not all details about voice variability can be described in the text prompt, and 2) the limited availability of text prompt datasets, where vendors and large cost of data labeling are required to write text prompts for speech. In this work, we introduce PromptTTS 2 to address these challenges with a variation network to provide variability information of voice not captured by text prompts, and a prompt generation pipeline to utilize the large language models (LLM) to compose high quality text prompts. Specifically, the variation network predicts the representation extracted from the reference speech (which contains full information about voice variability) based on the text prompt representation. For the prompt generation pipeline, it generates text prompts for speech with a speech language understanding model to recognize voice attributes (e.g., gender, speed) from speech and a large language model to formulate text prompts based on the recognition results. Experiments on a large-scale (44K hours) speech dataset demonstrate that compared to the previous works, PromptTTS 2 generates voices more consistent with text prompts and supports the sampling of diverse voice variability, thereby offering users more choices on voice generation. Additionally, the prompt generation pipeline produces high-quality text prompts, eliminating the large labeling cost. The demo page of PromptTTS 2 is available (https://speechresearch.github.io/prompttts2).",
    "BrainSCUBA Fine-Grained Natural Language Captions of Visual Cortex Selectivity": "Understanding the functional organization of higher visual cortex is a central focus in neuroscience. Past studies have primarily mapped the visual and semantic selectivity of neural populations using hand-selected stimuli, which may potentially bias results towards pre-existing hypotheses of visual cortex functionality. Moving beyond conventional approaches, we introduce a data-driven method that generates natural language descriptions for images predicted to maximally activate individual voxels of interest. Our method -- Semantic Captioning Using Brain Alignments (\"BrainSCUBA\") -- builds upon the rich embedding space learned by a contrastive vision-language model and utilizes a pre-trained large language model to generate interpretable captions. We validate our method through fine-grained voxel-level captioning across higher-order visual regions. We further perform text-conditioned image synthesis with the captions, and show that our images are semantically coherent and yield high predicted activations. Finally, to demonstrate how our method enables scientific discovery, we perform exploratory investigations on the distribution of \"person\" representations in the brain, and discover fine-grained semantic selectivity in body-selective areas. Unlike earlier studies that decode text, our method derives *voxel-wise captions of semantic selectivity*. Our results show that BrainSCUBA is a promising means for understanding functional preferences in the brain, and provides motivation for further hypothesis-driven investigation of visual cortex.",
    "Understanding Large Language Models Through the Lens of Dataset Generation": "There has been increased interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for text dataset generation subject to a desired attribute, e.g., for use in downstream fine-tuning or training. These works generally focus on a single quality metric of the generated text, typically accuracy on a downstream task. However, this fails to consider whether the model even has the ability to faithfully model the data distribution of the desired real-world domain. In contrast, in this work, we additionally focus on important distributional metrics agnostic to the downstream task, such as data diversity and faithfulness. We show that even in simple domains, generated datasets reveal inherent trade-offs between these metrics across models and training regimes. Further, we find that our metrics not only describe the generated dataset, but also capture key aspects of the underlying model. This allows us to characterize the generated datasets, individual models and by comparison the properties of different model families and training paradigms. By focusing on sub-distributions well-represented in the training data of LLMs, we can, for example, show that popular instruction-tuning techniques strongly decrease the LLM’s text generation abilities, with respect to distributional aspects like diversity.",
    "Parrot Enhancing Multi-Turn Chat Models by Learning to Ask Questions": "Impressive progress has been made on chat models based on Large Language Models (LLMs) recently; however, there is a noticeable lag in multi-turn conversations between open-source chat models (e.g., Alpaca and Vicuna) and the leading chat models (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT-4). Through a series of analyses, we attribute the lag to the lack of enough high-quality multi-turn instruction-tuning\ndata. The available instruction-tuning data for the community are either singleturn conversations or multi-turn ones with certain issues, such as non-human-like instructions, less detailed responses, or rare topic shifts. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Parrot, a highly scalable solution designed to automatically generate high-quality instruction-tuning data, which are then used to enhance the effectiveness of chat models in multi-turn conversations. Specifically, we start by training the Parrot-Ask model, which is designed to emulate real users in generating instructions. We then utilize Parrot-Ask to engage in multiturn conversations with ChatGPT across a diverse range of topics, resulting in a collection of 40K high-quality multi-turn dialogues (Parrot-40K). These data are subsequently employed to train a chat model that we have named Parrot-Chat. We demonstrate that the dialogues gathered from Parrot-Ask markedly outperform existing multi-turn instruction-following datasets in critical metrics, including topic diversity, number of turns, and resemblance to human conversation. With only 40K training examples, Parrot-Chat achieves strong performance against other 13B open-source models across a range of instruction-following benchmarks, and particularly excels in evaluations of multi-turn capabilities. All codes and datasets will be publicly available to facilitate future research.",
    "Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning": "We propose a new method, Adversarial In-Context Learning (adv-ICL), to optimize prompt for in-context learning (ICL) by employing one LLM as a generator, another as a discriminator, and a third as a prompt modifier. As in traditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two player game between the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, because our method uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters, it is computationally efficient, easy to extend to any LLM and task, and effective in low-resource settings.",
    "Controllable Text-to-Image Generation with Automatic Sketches": "Current text-to-image generation models often struggle to follow textual instructions, especially the ones requiring spatial reasoning. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown remarkable precision in generating code snippets for sketching out text inputs graphically, e.g., via TikZ. In this work, we introduce Control-GPT to guide the diffusion-based text-to-image pipelines with programmatic sketches generated by GPT-4, enhancing their abilities for instruction following. Control-GPT works by querying GPT-4 to write TikZ code, and the generated sketches are used as references alongside the text instructions for diffusion models (e.g., ControlNet) to generate photo-realistic images. One major challenge to training our pipeline is the lack of a dataset containing aligned text, images, and sketches. We address the issue by converting instance masks in existing datasets into polygons to mimic the sketches used at test time. As a result, Control-GPT greatly boosts the controllability of image generation. It establishes a new state-of-the-art on spatial arrangement and object positioning generation. It enhances users' control of object positions, sizes, etc., nearly doubling the accuracy of prior models. As a first attempt, our work shows the potential for employing LLMs to enhance performance in computer vision tasks.",
    "MedJourney Counterfactual Medical Image Generation by Instruction-Learning from Multimodal Patient Journeys": "Rapid progress has been made in instruction-learning for image editing with natural-language instruction, as exemplified by InstructPix2Pix. In biomedicine, such counterfactual generation methods can help differentiate causal structure from spurious correlation and facilitate robust image interpretation for disease progression modeling. However, generic image-editing models are ill-suited for the biomedical domain, and counterfactual medical image generation is largely underexplored. In this paper, we present MedJourney, a novel method for counterfactual medical image generation by instruction-learning from multimodal patient journeys. Given a patient with two medical images taken at different time points, we use GPT-4 to process the corresponding imaging reports and generate natural language description of disease progression. The resulting triples (prior image, progression description, new image) are then used to train a latent diffusion model for counterfactual medical image generation. Given the relative scarcity of image time series data, we introduce a two-stage curriculum that first pretrains the denoising network using the much more abundant single image-report pairs (with dummy prior image), and then continues training using the counterfactual triples. Experiments using the standard MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate the promise of our method. In a comprehensive battery of tests on counterfactual medical image generation, MedJourney substantially outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in instruction image editing and medical image generation such as InstructPix2Pix and RoentGen.

    "Self Guided Exploration for Automatic and Diverse AI Supervision": "Training large transformers using next-token prediction has given rise to groundbreaking advancements in AI. \nWhile this generative AI approach has produced impressive results, it heavily leans on human supervision. \nEven state-of-the-art AI models like ChatGPT depend on fine-tuning through human demonstrations, demanding extensive human input and domain expertise. This strong reliance on human oversight poses a significant hurdle to the advancement of AI innovation.\nTo address this limitation, we propose a novel paradigm termed Exploratory AI (EAI) aimed at autonomously generating high-quality training data. \nDrawing inspiration from the principles of unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) pretraining, EAI achieves exploration within the natural language space. We accomplish this by harnessing large language models to assess the novelty of generated content. Our approach employs two key components: an actor that generates novel content and a critic that evaluates the generated content, offering critiques to guide the actor. \nEmpirical evaluations demonstrate that EAI significantly boosts model performance on complex reasoning tasks, addressing the limitations of human-intensive supervision.",
    "Knowledge-Infused Prompting Assessing and Advancing Clinical Text Data Generation with Large Language Models": "Clinical natural language processing requires methods that can address domain-specific challenges, such as complex medical terminology and clinical contexts. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in this domain. Yet, their direct deployment can lead to privacy issues and are constrained by resources. To address this challenge, we delve into synthetic clinical text generation using LLMs for clinical NLP tasks. We propose an innovative, resource-efficient approach, ClinGen, which infuses knowledge into the process. Our model involves clinical knowledge extraction and context-informed LLM prompting. Both clinical topics and writing styles are drawn from external domain-specific knowledge graphs and LLMs to guide data generation. Our extensive empirical study across 7 clinical NLP tasks and 16 datasets reveals that ClinGen consistently enhances performance across various tasks, effectively aligning the distribution of real datasets and significantly enriching the diversity of generated training instances. We will publish our code and all the generated data upon acceptance.",
    "Optimizing Interpersonal Communication by Simulating Audiences with Large Language Models": "How do we communicate with others to achieve our goals?\nWe use our prior experience or advice from others, or construct a candidate utterance by predicting how it will be received. However, our experiences are limited and biased, and reasoning about potential outcomes can be difficult and cognitively challenging. \nIn this paper, we explore how we can leverage current Large Language Models (LLMs) to help us communicate better.\nSpecifically, we propose the Explore-Generate-Simulate (EGS) framework, which takes as input any scenario where an individual is communicating to an audience with a goal they want to achieve, 1) explores the solution space by first producing a diverse set of advice relevant to the scenario, 2) generates potential candidates conditioned on subsets of the advice, and 3) simulates the reactions from various audiences, selecting both the best candidate and advice to use. \nWe evaluate the framework on eight scenarios spanning the ten fundamental processes of interpersonal communication. \nFor each scenario, we collect a dataset of human evaluations across candidates and baselines and showcase that our framework's chosen candidate is preferred over popular baseline generation mechanisms including Chain-of-Thought.\nWe also find that audience simulations achieve reasonably high agreement with human raters across $5$ of the $8$ scenarios.  \nFurthermore, we demonstrate the generality of our framework by applying it to real-world scenarios described by users on web forums. Viewing LLMs as a library of shared experiences and opinions, our approach draws on this library to integrate cultural and individual experience and ultimately help people communicate better.",
    "End-to-end Story Plot Generator": "Story plots, while short, carry most of the essential information of a full story that may contain tens of thousands of words. We study the problem of automatic generation of story plots, which includes story premise, character descriptions, plot outlines, etc. To generate a single engaging plot, existing plot generators (e.g., DOC (Yang et al., 2022a)) require hundreds to thousands of calls to LLMs (e.g., OpenAI API) in the planning stage of the story plot, which is costly and takes at least several minutes. Moreover, the hard-wired nature of the method makes the pipeline non-differentiable, blocking fast specialization and personalization of the plot generator. In this paper, we overcome these issues with an end-to-end story plot generator, which is (1) faster and cheaper to generate and (2) end-to-end fine-tunable with human feedback. Compared to DOC, our work replaces expensive OpenAI API calls with Llama2 models via careful prompt designs, which leads to the cheap generation of high-quality training datasets. We then perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using approximately 13000 story plots to obtain an end-to-end model. The end-to-end model can generate story plots of comparable quality to the previous DOC method and is $>10\\times$ faster (1k tokens in only 30 seconds on average). Furthermore, fine-tuned with RLHF on several different reward models for different aspects of story quality, our model achieves 60.0\\% winning rate against the model after SFT in the aspect of suspense and surprise.",
    "Zero-Shot Goal-Directed Dialogue via RL on Imagined Conversations": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful and general solutions to many natural language tasks. However, many of the most important applications of language generation are interactive, where an agent has to talk to a person to reach a desired outcome.\nFor example, a teacher might try to understand their student's current comprehension level to tailor their instruction accordingly, and a travel agent might ask questions of their customer to understand their preferences in order to recommend activities they might enjoy.\nLLMs trained with supervised fine-tuning or ``single-step'' RL, as with standard RLHF, might struggle which tasks that require such goal-directed behavior, since they are not trained to optimize for overall conversational outcomes after multiple turns of interaction. In this work, we explore a new method for adapting LLMs with RL for such goal-directed dialogue. Our key insight is that, though LLMs might not effectively solve goal-directed dialogue tasks out of the box, they can provide useful data for solving such tasks by simulating suboptimal but human-like behaviors. Given a textual description of a goal-directed dialogue task, we leverage LLMs to sample diverse synthetic rollouts of hypothetical in-domain human-human interactions. Our algorithm then utilizes this dataset with offline reinforcement learning to train an interactive conversational agent that can optimize goal-directed objectives over multiple turns. In effect, the LLM produces examples of possible interactions, and RL then processes these examples to learn to perform more optimal interactions. Empirically, we show that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in various goal-directed dialogue tasks that include teaching and preference elicitation.",
    "ACES Generating Diverse Programming Puzzles with Autotelic Language Models and Semantic Descriptors": "Finding and selecting new and interesting problems to solve is at the heart of curiosity, science and innovation. We here study automated problem generation in the context of the open-ended space of python programming puzzles. Existing generative models often aim at modeling a reference distribution without any explicit diversity optimization. Other methods explicitly optimizing for diversity do so either in limited hand-coded representation spaces or in uninterpretable learned embedding spaces that may not align with human perceptions of interesting variations. With ACES (Autotelic Code Exploration via Semantic descriptors), we introduce a family of autotelic generation methods that leverage semantic descriptors evaluated by a large language model (LLM) to directly optimize for interesting diversity. Each puzzle is labeled along 10 dimensions, each capturing a programming skill required to solve it. ACES generates and pursues novel and feasible goals to explore that abstract semantic space, slowly discovering a diversity of solvable programming puzzles in any given run. Across a set of experiments, we show that ACES discovers a richer diversity of puzzles than existing diversity-maximizing algorithms as measured across a range of diversity metrics. We further study whether and in which conditions this diversity can translate into the successful training of puzzle solving models.",
    "Large Multimodal Model for Real-World Radiology Report Generation": "While automatic report generation has demonstrated promising results using deep learning-based methods, deploying these algorithms in real-world scenarios remains challenging. Compared to conventional report generation, real-world report generation requires model to follow the instruction from the radiologists and consider contextual information. Thus, this paper focuses on developing a practical report generation method that supports real-world clinical practice. To tackle the challenges posed by the limited availability of clinical data, we propose a GPT-based unified data generation pipeline designed to produce high-quality data. Consequently, we present a new benchmark dataset MIMIC-R3G, comprising five representative tasks pertinent to real-world medical report generation. We propose Domain-enhanced Multi-modal Model (DeMMo), where an additional medical domain vision encoder is incorporated into the general domain multimodal LLM to enhance its ability on specific domains. This approach aims to harness the specialized capabilities of the medical domain vision encoder while leveraging the robustness and versatility of the general domain multi-modal LLM. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach attains competitive performance across all real-world tasks compared to existing interactive report generation frameworks and state-of-the-art encoder-decoder style report generation models.",
    "WavJourney Compositional Audio Creation with Large Language Models": "Despite breakthroughs in audio generation models, their capabilities are often confined to domain-specific conditions such as speech transcriptions and audio captions. However, real-world audio creation aims to generate harmonious audio containing various elements such as speech, music, and sound effects with controllable conditions, which is challenging to address using existing audio generation systems. We present WavJourney, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to connect various audio models for audio creation. WavJourney allows users to create storytelling audio content with diverse audio elements simply from textual descriptions. Specifically, given a text instruction, WavJourney first prompts LLMs to generate an audio script that serves as a structured semantic representation of audio elements. The audio script is then converted into a computer program, where each line of the program calls a task-specific audio generation model or computational operation function. The computer program is then executed to obtain a compositional and interpretable solution for audio creation. Experimental results suggest that WavJourney is capable of synthesizing realistic audio aligned with textually-described semantic, spatial and temporal conditions, achieving state-of-the-art results on text-to-audio generation benchmarks. Additionally, we introduce a new multi-genre story benchmark. Subjective evaluations demonstrate the potential of WavJourney in crafting engaging storytelling audio content from text. We further demonstrate that WavJourney can facilitate human-machine co-creation in multi-round dialogues. To foster future research, the code and synthesized audio are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/w/WavJourney_Anonymous/.",
    "Curated LLM Synergy of LLMs and Data Curation for tabular augmentation in ultra low-data regimes": "Machine Learning (ML) in low-data settings remains an underappreciated yet crucial problem.  This challenge is pronounced in low-to-middle income countries where access to large datasets is often limited or even absent. Hence, data augmentation methods to increase the sample size of datasets needed for ML are key to unlocking the transformative potential of ML in data-deprived regions and domains. \nUnfortunately, the limited training set constrains traditional tabular synthetic data generators in their ability to generate a large and diverse augmented dataset needed for ML tasks. To address this technical challenge, we introduce $\\texttt{CLLM}$, which leverages the prior knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) for data augmentation in the low-data regime.  While diverse, not all the data generated by LLMs will help increase utility for a downstream task, as for any generative model. Consequently, we introduce a principled curation process, leveraging learning dynamics, coupled with confidence and uncertainty metrics, to obtain a high-quality dataset. Empirically, on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of LLMs in the low-data regime compared to conventional generators. We further show our curation mechanism improves the downstream performance for all generators, including LLMs. Additionally, we provide insights and understanding into the LLM generation and curation mechanism, shedding light on the features that enable them to output high-quality augmented datasets. $\\texttt{CLLM}$ paves the way for wider usage of ML in data scarce domains and regions, by allying the strengths of LLMs with a robust data-centric approach.",
    "Enhanced Visual Instruction Tuning for Text-Rich Image Understanding": "Instruction tuning enhances the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with humans. Furthermore, recent instruction-following datasets include images as visual input, collecting responses for image-based instructions. However, current visual instruction-tuned models cannot comprehend textual details within images well. This work enhances the current visual instruction tuning pipeline with text-rich images (e.g., movie posters, book covers, etc.). Specifically, we first used publicly available OCR tools to collect results on 422K text-rich images from the LAION dataset. Furthermore, we prompt text-only GPT-4 with recognized text and image captions to generate 16K conversations, each containing question-answer pairs for text-rich images. By combining our collected data with previous multimodal instruction-following data, our model, LLaVAR, substantially improves the capability of the LLaVA model on text-based VQA datasets (up to 20\\% accuracy improvement). The GPT-4-based instruction-following evaluation also demonstrates the improvement of our model on both natural images and text-rich images. Through qualitative analysis, LLaVAR shows promising interaction skills (e.g., reasoning, writing, and elaboration) with humans based on the latest real-world online content that combines text and images. We make our code/data/models publicly available.",
    "Text Descriptions are Compressive and Invariant Representations for Visual Learning": "Modern image classification is based upon directly predicting classes via large discriminative networks, which do not directly contain information about the intuitive visual features that may constitute a classification decision. \nRecently, work in vision-language models (VLM) such as CLIP has provided ways to specify natural language descriptions of image classes, but typically focuses on providing single descriptions for each class. In this work, we demonstrate that an alternative approach, in line with humans' understanding of multiple visual features per class, can also provide compelling performance in the robust few-shot learning setting. \nIn particular, we introduce a novel method, \\textit{SLR-AVD (Sparse Logistic Regression using Augmented Visual Descriptors)}. This method first automatically generates multiple visual descriptions of each class via a large language model (LLM), then uses a VLM to translate these descriptions to a set of visual feature embeddings of each image, and finally uses sparse logistic regression to select a relevant subset of these features to classify each image.\nCore to our approach is the fact that, information-theoretically, these descriptive features are more invariant to domain shift than traditional image embeddings, even though the VLM training process is not explicitly designed for invariant representation learning. These invariant descriptive features also compose a better input compression scheme. When combined with finetuning, we show that SLR-AVD is able to outperform existing state-of-the-art finetuning approaches on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance.",
    "VibeSpace Automatic vector embedding creation for arbitrary domains and mapping between them using large language models": "We present VibeSpace; a method for the fully unsupervised construction of interpretable embedding spaces applicable to arbitrary domain areas. By leveraging knowledge contained within large language models, our method automates otherwise costly data acquisition processes and assesses the similarity of entities, allowing for meaningful and interpretable positioning within vector spaces. Our approach is also capable of learning intelligent mappings between vector space representations of non-overlapping domains, allowing for a novel form of cross-domain similarity analysis. First, we demonstrate that our data collection methodology yields comprehensive and rich datasets across multiple domains, including songs, books, and movies. Second, we show that our method yields single-domain embedding spaces which are separable by various domain specific features. These representations provide a solid foundation upon which we can develop classifiers and initialise recommender systems, demonstrating our method's utility as a data-free solution to the cold-start problem. Further, these spaces can be interactively queried to obtain semantic information about different regions in embedding spaces. Lastly, we argue that by exploiting the unique capabilities of current state-of-the-art large language models, we produce cross-domain mappings which capture contextual relationships between heterogeneous entities which may not be attainable through traditional methods. The presented method facilitates the creation of embedding spaces of any domain which circumvents the need for collection and calibration of sensitive user data, as well as providing deeper insights and better interpretations of multi-domain data.",
    "Towards reporting bias in visual-language datasets bimodal augmentation by decoupling object-attribute association": "Reporting bias arises when people assume that some knowledge is universally understood and hence, do not necessitate explicit elaboration. In this paper, we focus on the wide existence of reporting bias in visual-language datasets, embodied as the object-attribute association, which can subsequentially degrade models trained on them. To mitigate this bias, we propose a bimodal augmentation (BiAug) approach through object-attribute decoupling to flexibly synthesize visual-language examples with a rich array of object-attribute pairing and construct cross-modal hard negatives. We employ large language models (LLMs) in conjunction with a grounding object detector to extract target objects. Subsequently, the LLM generates a detailed attribute description for each object and produces a corresponding hard negative counterpart. An inpainting model is then used to create images based on these detailed object descriptions. By doing so, the synthesized examples explicitly complement omitted objects and attributes to learn, and the hard negative pairs steer the model to distinguish object attributes. Our experiments demonstrated that BiAug is superior in object-attribute understanding. In addition, BiAug also improves the performance on zero-shot retrieval tasks on general benchmarks like MSCOCO and Flickr30K.\nBiAug refines the way of collecting text-image datasets. Mitigating the reporting bias helps models achieve a deeper understanding of visual-language phenomena, expanding beyond mere frequent patterns to encompass the richness and diversity of real-world scenarios.",
    "JudgeLM  Fine-tuned Large Language Models are Scalable Judges": "Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in open-ended scenarios is challenging due to existing benchmarks and metrics can not measure them comprehensively. To address this problem, we propose to fine-tune LLMs as scalable judges (JudgeLM) to evaluate LLMs efficiently and effectively in open-ended benchmarks. We first propose a comprehensive, large-scale, high-quality dataset containing task seeds, LLMs-generated answers, and GPT-4-generated judgments for fine-tuning high-performance judges, as well as a new benchmark for evaluating the judges. We train JudgeLM at different scales from 7B, 13B, to 33B parameters, and conduct a systematic analysis of its capabilities and behaviors. We then analyze the key biases in fine-tuning LLM as a judge and consider them as position bias, knowledge bias, and format bias. To address these issues, JudgeLM introduces a bag of techniques including swap augmentation, reference support, and reference drop, which clearly enhance the judge's performance. JudgeLM obtains the state-of-the-art judge performance on both the existing PandaLM benchmark and our proposed new benchmark. Our JudgeLM is efficient and the JudgeLM-7B only needs 3 mins to judge 5K samples with 8 A100 GPUs. JudgeLM obtains high agreement with the teacher judge, achieving an agreement exceeding 90% that even surpasses human-to-human agreement. JudgeLM also demonstrates extended capabilities in being judges of the single answer, multimodal models, multiple answers, and multi-turn chat.",
    "Tiny-StyleWizard Unleashing the Potential of Small Language Models in Complex Style Transfer": "Text style transfer is a crucial task in natural language processing. While previous studies focused on simple styles like sentiment and formality, they overlooked the transfer of valuable complex styles. In this paper, we propose a framework named Tiny-StyleWizard to address this challenge. It first generates a specialized dataset retaining key aspects of the desired complex style based on diverse corpora and a large language model (LLM) and then fine-tines a small language model to achieve the goal of complex style transfer. Additionally, a novel evaluation protocol is devised to rank the quality of the generated specialized dataset and to measure the performance of different models. Extensive experiments on two representative complex style transfer tasks reveal that small language models like BART-base/large can produce stylized text on par with ChatGPT while the tinier ones like T5-mini (about 30M parameters) could surpass the state-of-the-art models. Intriguingly, Our investigation on the efficient construction of the training corpus shows the phenomenon named \"less is more\" and the subsequent similar \"ungrokking\" observation, emphasizing the supreme importance of data quality. Further exploration also showcases the sufficient diversity of the generation texts obtained by our Tiny-StyleWizard framework.",
    "TextBind Multi-turn Interleaved Multimodal Instruction-following in the Wild": "Large language models with instruction-following abilities have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. These models show exceptional generalizability to tackle various real-world tasks through their natural language interfaces. However, their performance heavily relies on high-quality exemplar data, which is often difficult to obtain. This challenge is further exacerbated when it comes to multimodal instruction following. We introduce TextBind, an almost annotation-free framework for empowering LLMs with multi-turn interleaved multimodal instruction-following capabilities. Our approach requires only image-caption pairs and generates multi-turn multimodal instruction-response conversations from a language model. To accommodate interleaved image-text inputs and outputs, we devise MIM, a language model-centric architecture that seamlessly integrates image encoder and decoder models. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MIM trained on TextBind achieves impressive generation capability in multi-modal conversations  compared to recent baselines.",
    "AutoHall Automated Hallucination Dataset Generation for Large Language Models": "While Large language models (LLMs) have garnered widespread applications across various domains due to their powerful language understanding and generation capabilities, the detection of non-factual or hallucinatory content generated by LLMs remains scarce. Currently, one significant challenge in hallucination detection is the laborious task of time-consuming and expensive manual annotation of the hallucinatory generation. To address this issue, this paper first introduces a method for $\\underline{auto}$matically constructing model-specific $\\underline{hall}$ucination datasets based on existing fact-checking datasets called $\\textbf{AutoHall}$. Furthermore, we propose a zero-resource and black-box hallucination detection method based on self-contradiction. We conduct experiments towards prevalent open-/closed-source LLMs, achieving superior hallucination detection performance compared to extant baselines. Moreover, our experiments reveal variations in hallucination proportions and types among different models.",
    "Chain of Images for Intuitively Reasoning": "The human brain is naturally equipped to comprehend and interpret visual information rapidly.\nWhen confronted with complex problems or concepts, we prefer to use flowcharts, sketches, and diagrams to aid our thought process.\nLeveraging this inherent ability can significantly enhance logical reasoning.\nHowever, currently large language models do not utilize such visual intuition to help their thinking.\nTo mitigate such limitations, we present Chain of Images (CoI), which can convert complex language reasoning problems to simple pattern recognition by generating a series of images as intermediate representations.\nIn supporting our CoI reasoning, we introduce a symbolic multi-modal model (SyMLM) that generates images strictly based on language instructions and accepts both text and image as input.\nExperiments on Geometry, Chess and Common Sense tasks show that Chain of Images prompting improve the performance by a large margin over the pure-language Chain of Thoughts (CoT) baselines.\nThese results underscore the benefits of intuitive reasoning: 1) An image can represent complex textual logic in a more compact and intuitive way; \n2) Images concisely capture the state at each step in long reasoning chains;\n3) Images can help eliminate the textual hallucination problem and introduce visual commonsense knowledge.",
    "Text-guided Diffusion Model for 3D Molecule Generation": "The *de novo* generation of molecules with desired properties is a critical task in fields like biology, chemistry, and drug discovery.\nRecent advancements in diffusion models, particularly equivariant diffusion models, have shown promise in generating 3D molecular structures.\nHowever, these models largely work under value guidance, typically conditioning on a single property value, which might limit their ability to address complex real-world requirements.\nTo address this, we propose the text guidance instead, and introduce TEDMol, a new *Text-guided Diffusion Model for 3D Molecule Generation*.\nIt aims to integrate the capabilities of language models with diffusion models, thereby providing a deeper level of language understanding in 3D molecule generation.\nSpecifically, TEDMol utilizes textual conditions to guide the reverse process, enabling the adept and flexible generation of 3D molecules.\nOur experimental results on various tasks demonstrate that TEDMol not only enhances the stability and diversity of the generated molecules, but also excels in capturing and utilizing information derived from textual descriptions.\nOur approach forms a flexible and efficient text-guided molecular diffusion framework, providing a powerful tool for generating 3D molecular structures in response to complex, textual conditions.",
    "Harnessing the Power of Large Language Models for Natural Language to First-Order Logic Translation": "Translating natural language sentences to first-order logic (NL-FOL translation) remains a critical task in many logic-based NLP systems, as it enables ML models to reason logically over text.\nHowever, existing translation methods still struggle to scale to real-world tasks due to the lack of a large and high-quality dataset and a model family with high precision and coverage.\n\nIn this work, we approach this longstanding challenge by harnessing the power of pre-trained large language models (LLMs).\nTo do so, we present MALLS (large language **M**odel gener**A**ted N**L**-FO**L** pair**S**), a dataset of 28K diverse and verified sentence-level NL-FOL pairs collected from GPT-4.\nWe create MALLS by implementing an adaptive pipeline that prompts GPT-4 for pairs with rich and diverse contexts. \nTo ensure the validity of FOL rules and their alignment with the NL sentences, we utilized a combined strategy of FOL rule parsing, human annotation, and automatic filtering.\n\nWe also present LogicLLaMA, an LLaMA2-7B/13B model family fine-tuned on MALLS for NL-FOL translation. \nLogicLLaMA is capable of directly translating natural language into FOL rules, which outperforms GPT-3.5. \nLogicLLaMA is also equipped to correct FOL rules predicted by GPT-3.5, and can achieve similar performance as GPT-4 with a fraction of the cost.\nThis correction ability was achieved by a novel reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) framework, which initially trains on synthetically perturbed NL-FOL pairs to encourage chain-of-thought reasoning and then fine-tunes with RLHF on GPT-3.5 outputs using a FOL verifier as the reward model. \nCodes and data are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t0f69776773e9er/AABKaWuvepUvhSp-0u2w-b2Pa?dl=0).",
    "Just-in-Time Security Patch Detection - LLM At the Rescue for Data Augmentation": "In the face of growing vulnerabilities found in open-source software, the need to identify {discreet} security patches has become paramount. The lack of consistency in how software providers handle maintenance often leads to the release of security patches without comprehensive advisories, leaving users vulnerable to unaddressed security risks.  To address this pressing issue, we introduce a novel security patch detection system, LLMDA, which capitalizes on Large Language Models (LLMs) and code-text alignment methodologies for patch review, data enhancement, and feature combination. Within LLMDA, we initially utilize LLMs for examining patches and expanding data of PatchDB and SPI-DB, two security patch datasets from recent literature. We then use labeled instructions to direct our LLMDA, differentiating patches based on security relevance. Following this, we apply a PTFormer to merge patches with code, formulating hybrid attributes that encompass both the innate details and the interconnections between the patches and the code. This distinctive combination method allows our system to capture more insights from the combined context of patches and code, hence improving detection precision. Finally, we devise a probabilistic batch contrastive learning mechanism within batches to augment the capability of the our LLMDA in discerning security patches. The results reveal that LLMDA significantly surpasses the start of the art techniques in detecting security patches, underscoring its promise in fortifying software maintenance.",

In RLHF practice, preference data plays a crucial role in bridging human proclivity and LLMs.\nHowever, the scarcity of diverse, naturalistic datasets of human preferences on LLM outputs at scale poses a great challenge to RLHF as well as feedback learning research within the open-source community.\nCurrent preference datasets, either proprietary or limited in size and prompt variety, result in limited RLHF adoption in open-source models and hinder further exploration.\nIn this study, we propose UltraFeedback, a large-scale, high-quality, and diversified preference dataset designed to overcome these limitations and foster RLHF development. To create UltraFeedback, we compile a diverse array of instructions and models from multiple sources to produce comparative data.

    "Democratizing LLMs for Low-Resource Languages by Leveraging their English Dominant Abilities with Linguistically-Diverse Prompts": "Large language models (LLMs) are known to effectively perform tasks by simply observing few exemplars. However, in low-resource languages, obtaining such hand-picked exemplars can still be challenging, where unsupervised techniques may be necessary. Moreover, competent generative capabilities of LLMs are observed only in high-resource languages, while their performances among under-represented languages fall behind due to pre-training data imbalance. To elicit LLMs' ability onto low-resource languages without any supervised data, we propose to assemble synthetic exemplars from a diverse set of high-resource languages to prompt the LLMs to translate from any language into English. These prompts are then used to create intra-lingual exemplars to perform tasks in the target languages. Our unsupervised prompting method performs on par with supervised few-shot learning in LLMs of different sizes for translations between English and 13 Indic and 21 African low-resource languages. We also show that fine-tuning a 7B model on data generated from our method helps it perform competitively with a 175B model. In non-English translation tasks, our method even outperforms supervised prompting by up to 3 chrF++ in many low-resource languages. When evaluated on zero-shot multilingual summarization, our method surpasses other English-pivoting baselines by up to 4 ROUGE-L and is also favored by GPT-4.",

This task seeks to adjust the models' responses to opinion-related questions on specified topics since an individual's personality often manifests in the form of their expressed opinions, thereby showcasing different personality traits. Specifically, we construct a new benchmark dataset PersonalityEdit to address this task. Drawing on the theory in Social Psychology, we isolate three representative traits, namely Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness, as the foundation for our benchmark. We then gather data using GPT-4, generating responses that not only align with a specified topic but also embody the targeted personality trait. \nWe conduct comprehensive experiments involving various baselines and discuss the representation of personality behavior in LLMs. Our intriguing findings uncover potential challenges of the proposed task, illustrating several remaining issues.

Meanwhile, the wealth of human-curated protein knowledge in text form presents a unique opportunity for LLMs to contribute to advanced protein design. In this work, we propose a new LLMs-based framework, namely NL2ProGPT, for macromolecular protein sequence generation that bridges the domain gap between natural and protein languages. Specifically, we first combine the protein functions and properties to create specific text guidelines for designing the protein, ensuring it follows precise controls. Second, to form a more informative and generalizable protein description, we explicitly inject protein structural information by clustering the embeddings from pre-trained protein language models. Third, we train a reward model to align the protein language model with the Rosetta energy function, following an RLAIF (reinforced learning from AI feedback) fashion. We empirically verify the effectiveness of NL2ProGPT from three aspects: (1) outperforms existing protein sequence design methods in different evaluations; (2) exhibits more than 90\\% consistency in text-to-protein generation; (3) has effective exploration potential in disordered regions.",

However, existing VLMs face challenges in handling real-world applications with complex scenes and multiple objects, as well as aligning their focus with the diverse attention patterns of human users. In this paper, we introduce gaze information, feasibly collected by AR or VR devices, as a proxy for human attention to guide VLMs and propose a novel approach, Voila-A, for gaze alignment to enhance the interpretability and effectiveness of these models in real-world applications.\nFirst, we collect hundreds of minutes of gaze data to demonstrate that we can mimic human gaze modalities using localized narratives. We then design an automatic data annotation pipeline utilizing GPT-4 to generate the VOILA-COCO dataset. Additionally, we innovate the Voila Perceiver modules to integrate gaze information into VLMs while preserving their pretrained knowledge.\nWe evaluate Voila-A using a hold-out validation set and a newly collected VOILA-GAZE Testset, which features real-life scenarios captured with a gaze-tracking device. Our experimental results demonstrate that Voila-A significantly outperforms several baseline models. By aligning model attention with human gaze patterns, Voila-A paves the way for more intuitive, user-centric VLMs and fosters engaging human-AI interaction across a wide range of applications.",
    "StructChart Perception, Structuring, Reasoning for Visual Chart Understanding": "Charts are common in literature across different scientific fields, conveying rich information easily accessible to readers. Current chart-related tasks focus on either chart perception which refers to extracting information from the visual charts, or performing reasoning given the extracted data, e.g. in a tabular form. In this paper, we aim to establish a unified and label-efficient learning paradigm for joint perception and reasoning tasks, which can be generally applicable to different downstream tasks, beyond the question-answering task as specifically studied in peer works. Specifically, StructChart first reformulates the chart information from the popular tubular form (specifically linearized CSV) to the proposed Structured Triplet Representations (STR), which is more friendly for reducing the task gap between chart perception and reasoning due to the employed structured information extraction for charts. We then propose a Structuring Chart-oriented Representation Metric (SCRM) to quantitatively evaluate the performance for the chart perception task. To enrich the dataset for training, we further explore the possibility of leveraging the Large Language Model (LLM), enhancing the chart diversity in terms of both chart visual style and its statistical information. Extensive experiments are conducted on various chart-related tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and promising potential for a unified chart perception-reasoning paradigm to push the frontier of chart understanding.",
    "Valley Video Assistant with Large Language model Enhanced abilitY": "Large language models (LLMs), with their remarkable conversational capabilities, have demonstrated impressive performance across various applications and have emerged as formidable AI assistants. In view of this, it raises an intuitive question: Can we harness the power of LLMs to build multimodal AI assistants for visual applications? Recently, several multi-modal models have been developed for this purpose. They typically pre-train an adaptation module to align the semantics of the vision encoder and language model, followed by fine-tuning on instruction-following data. However, despite the success of this pipeline in image and language understanding, its effectiveness in joint video and language understanding has not been widely explored. In this paper, we aim to develop a novel multimodal foundation model capable of comprehending video, image, and language within a general framework. To achieve this goal, we introduce Valley, a Video Assistant with Large Language model Enhanced abilitY. The Valley consists of a LLM, a temporal modeling module, a visual encoder, and a simple projection module designed to bridge visual and textual modes. To empower Valley with video comprehension and instruction-following capabilities, we construct a video instruction dataset and adopt a two-stage tuning procedure to train it. Specifically, we employ ChatGPT to facilitate the construction of task-oriented conversation data encompassing various tasks, including multi-shot captions, long video descriptions, action recognition, causal relationship inference, etc. Subsequently, we adopt a pre-training-then-instructions-tuned pipeline to align visual and textual modalities and improve the instruction-following capability of Valley. Qualitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that Valley has the potential to function as a highly effective video assistant that can make complex video understanding scenarios easy. Our Code, data, and models will be open-sourced.",
    "Harnessing large-language models to generate private synthetic text": "Differentially private training algorithms like DP-SGD protect sensitive training data by ensuring that trained models do not reveal private information. An alternative approach, which this paper studies, is to use a sensitive dataset to generate synthetic data that is differentially private with respect to the original data, and then non-privately training a model on the synthetic data.  Doing so has several advantages: synthetic data can be reused for other tasks (including for hyper parameter tuning), retained indefinitely, and shared with third parties without sacrificing privacy. \n\nHowever, generating private synthetic data is much harder than training a private model. To improve performance on text data, recent work has utilized public data by starting with a pre-trained generative language model and privately fine-tuning it on sensitive data. This model can be used to sample a DP synthetic dataset. While this strategy seems straightforward, executing it has proven problematic. Previous approaches either show significant performance loss, or have, as we show, critical design flaws.\n \nIn this paper we demonstrate that a proper training objective along with tuning fewer parameters results in excellent DP synthetic data quality. Our approach is competitive with direct DP-training of downstream classifiers in terms of performance on downstream tasks. Further, we demonstrate that our DP synthetic data is not only useful for downstream classifier training, but also to tune those same models.",
    "GPT-FL Generative Pre-trained Model-Assisted Federated Learning": "In this work, we propose GPT-FL, a generative pre-trained model-assisted federated learning (FL) framework. At its core, GPT-FL leverages generative pre-trained models to generate diversified synthetic data. These generated data are used to train a downstream model on the server, which is then fine-tuned with private client data under the standard FL framework. We show that GPT-FL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods in terms of model test accuracy, communication efficiency, and client sampling efficiency. Through comprehensive ablation analysis, we discover that the downstream model generated by synthetic data plays a crucial role in controlling the direction of gradient diversity during FL training, which enhances convergence speed and contributes to the notable accuracy boost observed with GPT-FL. Also, regardless of whether the target data falls within or outside the domain of the pre-trained generative model, GPT-FL consistently achieves significant performance gains, surpassing the results obtained by models trained solely with FL or synthetic data.",
    "Mining Patents with Large Language Models Demonstrates Congruence of Functional Labels and Chemical Structures": "Predicting chemical function from structure is a major goal of the chemical sciences, from the discovery and repurposing of novel drugs to the creation of new materials. Recently, new machine learning algorithms are opening up the possibility of general predictive models spanning many different chemical functions. Here, we consider the challenge of applying large language models to chemical patents in order to consolidate and leverage the information about chemical functionality captured by these resources. Chemical patents contain vast knowledge on chemical function, but their usefulness as a dataset has historically been neglected due to the impracticality of extracting high-quality functional labels. Using a scalable ChatGPT-assisted patent summarization and word-embedding label cleaning pipeline, we derive a Chemical Function (CheF) dataset, containing 100K molecules and their patent-derived functional labels. The functional labels were validated to be of high quality, allowing us to detect a strong relationship between functional label and chemical structural spaces. Further, we find that the co-occurrence graph of the functional labels contains a robust semantic structure, which allowed us in turn to examine functional relatedness among the compounds. We then trained a model on the CheF dataset, allowing us to assign new functional labels to compounds. Using this model, we were able to retrodict approved Hepatitis C antivirals, uncover an antiviral mechanism undisclosed in the patent, and identify plausible serotonin-related drugs. The CheF dataset and associated model offers a promising new approach to predict chemical functionality.",
    "3D-GPT Procedural 3D Modeling with Large Language Models": "In the pursuit of efficient automated content creation, procedural generation, leveraging modifiable parameters and rule-based systems, emerges as a promising approach. Nonetheless, it could be a demanding endeavor, given its intricate nature necessitating a deep understanding of rules, algorithms, and parameters. To reduce workload, we introduce 3D-GPT, a framework utilizing large language models(LLMs) for instruction-driven 3D modeling. 3D-GPT positions LLMs as proficient problem solvers, dissecting the procedural 3D modeling tasks into accessible segments and appointing the apt agent for each task. 3D-GPT integrates three core agents: the task dispatch agent, the conceptualization agent, and the modeling agent. They collaboratively achieve two objectives. First, it enhances concise initial scene descriptions, evolving them into detailed forms while dynamically adapting the text based on subsequent instructions. Second, it integrates procedural generation, extracting parameter values from enriched text to effortlessly interface with 3D software for asset creation. Our empirical investigations confirm that 3D-GPT not only interprets and executes instructions, delivering reliable results but also collaborates effectively with human designers. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with Blender, unlocking expanded manipulation possibilities. \nOur work highlights the potential of LLMs in 3D modeling, offering a basic framework for future advancements in scene generation and animation.",
    "InternVid A Large-scale Video-Text Dataset for Multimodal Understanding and Generation": "This paper introduces InternVid, a large-scale video-centric multimodal dataset that enables learning powerful and transferable video-text representations for multimodal understanding and generation. InternVid contains over 7 million videos lasting nearly 760K hours, yielding 234M video clips accompanied by detailed descriptions of total 4.1B words. Our core contribution is to develop a scalable approach to autonomously build a high-quality video-text dataset with large language models (LLM), thereby showcasing its efficacy in learning video-language representation at scale. Specifically, we utilize a multi-scale approach to generate video-related descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce ViCLIP, a video-text representation learning model based on ViT-L. Learned on InternVid via contrastive learning, this model demonstrates leading zero-shot action recognition and competitive video retrieval performance. Beyond basic video understanding tasks like recognition and retrieval, our dataset and model have broad applications. They are particularly beneficial for generating interleaved video-text data for learning a video-centric dialogue system, advancing video-to-text and text-to-video generation research. These proposed resources provide a tool for researchers and practitioners interested in multimodal video understanding and generation.",
    "GenSim Generating Robotic Simulation Tasks via Large Language Models": "Collecting large amounts of real-world interaction data to train general robotic policies is often prohibitively expensive, thus motivating the use of simulation data. However, existing methods for data generation have generally focused on scene-level diversity (e.g., object instances and poses) rather than task-level diversity, due to the human effort required to come up with and verify novel tasks. This has made it challenging for policies trained on simulation data to demonstrate significant task-level generalization. In this paper, we propose to automatically generate rich simulation environments and expert demonstrations by exploiting a large language models' (LLM) grounding and coding ability. Our approach, dubbed GenSim, has two modes: goal-directed generation, wherein a target task is given to the LLM and the LLM proposes a task curriculum to solve the target task, and exploratory generation, wherein the LLM  bootstraps from previous tasks and iteratively proposes novel tasks that would be helpful in solving more complex tasks. We use GPT4 to expand the existing benchmark by ten times to over 100 tasks, on which we conduct supervised finetuning and evaluate several LLMs including finetuned GPTs and Code Llama on code generation for robotic simulation tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs-generated simulation programs can enhance task-level generalization significantly when used for multitask policy training. We further find that with minimal sim-to-real adaptation, the multitask policies pretrained on GPT4-generated simulation tasks exhibit stronger transfer to unseen long-horizon tasks in the real world and outperform baselines by 25%. See our project website (https://gen-sim.github.io) and demo (https://huggingface.co/spaces/Gen-Sim/Gen-Sim) for visualizations and open-source models and datasets.",
    "MUSTARD Mastering Uniform Synthesis of Theorem and Proof Data": "Recent large language models (LLMs) have witnessed significant advancement in various tasks, including mathematical reasoning and theorem proving. As these two tasks require strict and formal multi-step inference, they are appealing domains for exploring the reasoning ability of LLMs but still face important challenges. Previous studies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have revealed the effectiveness of intermediate steps guidance. However, such step-wise annotation requires heavy labor, leading to insufficient training steps for current benchmarks. To fill this gap, this work introduces MUSTARD, a data generation framework that masters uniform synthesis of theorem and proof data of high quality and diversity. MUSTARD synthesizes data in three stages: (1) It samples a few mathematical concept seeds as the problem category. (2) Then, it prompts a generative language model with the sampled concepts to obtain both the problems and their step-wise formal solutions. (3) Lastly, the framework utilizes a proof assistant (e.g., Lean Prover) to filter the valid proofs. With the proposed MUSTARD, we present a theorem-and-proof benchmark MUSTARDSAUCE with 5,866 valid data points. Each data point contains an informal statement, an informal proof, and a translated formal proof that passes the prover validation. We perform extensive analysis and demonstrate that MUSTARD generates validated high-quality step-by-step data. We further apply the MUSTARDSAUCE for fine-tuning smaller language models. The fine-tuned Llama 2-7B achieves a 15.41% average relative performance gain in automated theorem proving, and 8.18% in math word problems. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/Eleanor-H/MUSTARD.",
    "Unified Human-Scene Interaction via Prompted Chain-of-Contacts": "Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) is a vital component of fields like embodied AI and virtual reality. Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. The framework defines interaction as ``Chain of Contacts (CoC)\", representing steps involving human joint-object part pairs. This concept is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and corresponding contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.",
    "ToolLLM Facilitating Large Language Models to Master 16000+ Real-world APIs": "Despite the advancements of open-source large language models (LLMs), e.g., LLaMA, they remain significantly limited in tool-use capabilities, i.e., using external tools (APIs) to fulfill human instructions. The reason is that current instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks but ignores the tool-use domain. This is in contrast to the excellent tool-use capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA) closed-source LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use framework encompassing data construction, model training, and evaluation. We first present ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use, which is constructed automatically using ChatGPT. Specifically, the construction can be divided into three stages: (i) API collection: we collect 16,464 real-world RESTful APIs spanning 49 categories from RapidAPI Hub; (ii) instruction generation: we prompt ChatGPT to generate diverse instructions involving these APIs, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios; (iii) solution path annotation: we use ChatGPT to search for a valid solution path (chain of API calls) for each instruction. To enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we develop a novel depth-first search-based decision tree algorithm. It enables LLMs to evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space. Moreover, to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of LLMs, we develop an automatic evaluator: ToolEval. Based on ToolBench, we fine-tune LLaMA to obtain an LLM ToolLLaMA, and equip it with a neural API retriever to recommend appropriate APIs for each instruction. Experiments show that ToolLLaMA demonstrates a remarkable ability to execute complex instructions and generalize to unseen APIs, and exhibits comparable performance to ChatGPT. Our ToolLLaMA also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization ability in an out-of-distribution tool-use dataset: APIBench.",
    "Q-Bench A Benchmark for General-Purpose Foundation Models on Low-level Vision": "The rapid evolution of Multi-modality Large Language Models (MLLMs) has catalyzed a shift in computer vision from specialized models to general-purpose foundation models. Nevertheless, there is still an inadequacy in assessing the abilities of MLLMs on **low-level visual perception and understanding**. To address this gap, we present **Q-Bench**, a holistic benchmark crafted to systematically evaluate potential abilities of MLLMs on three realms: low-level visual perception, low-level visual description, and overall visual quality assessment. **_a)_** To evaluate the low-level **_perception_** ability, we construct the **LLVisionQA** dataset, consisting of 2,990 diverse-sourced images, each equipped with a human-asked question focusing on its low-level attributes. We then measure the correctness of MLLMs on answering these questions. **_b)_** To examine the **_description_** ability of MLLMs on low-level information, we propose the **LLDescribe** dataset consisting of long expert-labelled *golden* low-level text descriptions on 499 images, and a GPT-involved comparison pipeline between outputs of MLLMs and the *golden* descriptions. **_c)_** Besides these two tasks, we further measure their visual quality **_assessment_** ability to align with human opinion scores. Specifically, we design a softmax-based strategy that enables MLLMs to predict *quantifiable* quality scores, and evaluate them on various existing image quality assessment (IQA) datasets. Our evaluation across the three abilities confirms that MLLMs possess preliminary low-level visual skills. However, these skills are still unstable and relatively imprecise, indicating the need for specific enhancements on MLLMs towards these abilities. We hope that our benchmark can encourage the research community to delve deeper to discover and enhance these untapped potentials of MLLMs."
