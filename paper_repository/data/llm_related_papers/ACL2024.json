    "360◦REA: Towards A Reusable Experience Accumulation with 360◦ Assessment for Multi-Agent System": "Large language model agents have demonstrated remarkable advancements across various complex tasks. Recent works focus on optimizing the agent team or employing self-reflection to iteratively solve complex tasks. Since these agents are all based on the same LLM, only conducting self-evaluation or removing underperforming agents does not substantively enhance the capability of the agents. We argue that a comprehensive evaluation and accumulating experience from evaluation feedback is an effective approach to improving system performance. In this paper, we propose Reusable Experience Accumulation with 360◦Assessment (360◦REA), a hierarchical multi-agent framework inspired by corporate organizational practices. The framework employs a novel 360◦performance assessment method for multi-perspective performance evaluation with fine-grained assessment. To enhance the capability of agents in addressing complex tasks, we introduce dual-level experience pool for agents to accumulate experience through fine-grained assessment. Extensive experiments on complex task datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of 360◦REA.",
    "A + B: A General Generator-Reader Framework for Optimizing LLMs to Unleash Synergy Potential": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an effective solution to supplement necessary knowledge to large language models (LLMs). Targeting its bottleneck of retriever performance, “generate-then-read” pipeline is proposed to replace the retrieval stage with generation from the LLM itself. Although promising, this research direction is underexplored and still cannot work in the scenario when source knowledge is given. In this paper, we formalize a general “A + B” framework with varying combinations of foundation models and types for systematic investigation. We explore the efficacy of the base and chat versions of LLMs and found their different functionalities suitable for generator A and reader B, respectively. Their combinations consistently outperform single models, especially in complex scenarios. Furthermore, we extend the application of the “A + B” framework to scenarios involving source documents through continuous learning, enabling the direct integration of external knowledge into LLMs. This approach not only facilitates effective acquisition of new knowledge but also addresses the challenges of safety and helpfulness post-adaptation. The paper underscores the versatility of the “A + B” framework, demonstrating its potential to enhance the practical application of LLMs across various domains.",
    "A Chain-of-Thought Is as Strong as Its Weakest Link: A Benchmark for Verifiers of Reasoning Chains": "Prompting language models to provide step-by-step answers (e.g., “Chain-of-Thought”) is the prominent approach for complex reasoning tasks, where more accurate reasoning chains typically improve downstream task performance. Recent literature discusses automatic methods to verify reasoning steps to evaluate and improve their correctness. However, no fine-grained step-level datasets are available to enable thorough evaluation of such verification methods, hindering progress in this direction. We introduce REVEAL: Reasoning Verification Evaluation, a new dataset to benchmark automatic verifiers of complex Chain-of-Thought reasoning in open-domain question answering settings. REVEAL includes comprehensive labels for the relevance, attribution to evidence passages, and logical correctness of each reasoning step in a language model's answer, across a wide variety of datasets and state-of-the-art language models. Available at reveal-dataset.github.io.",
    "A Chinese Dataset for Evaluating the Safeguards in Large Language Models": "Many studies have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can produce harmful responses, exposing users to unexpected risks. Previous studies have proposed comprehensive taxonomies of LLM risks, as well as corresponding prompts that can be used to examine LLM safety. However, the focus has been almost exclusively on English. We aim to broaden LLM safety research by introducing a dataset for the safety evaluation of Chinese LLMs, and extending it to better identify false negative and false positive examples in terms of risky prompt rejections. We further present a set of fine-grained safety assessment criteria for each risk type, facilitating both manual annotation and automatic evaluation in terms of LLM response harmfulness. Our experiments over five LLMs show that region-specific risks are the prevalent risk type. Warning: this paper contains example data that may be offensive, harmful, or biased.",
    "A Community-Centric Perspective for Characterizing and Detecting Anti-Asian Violence-Provoking Speech": "Violence-provoking speech - speech that implicitly or explicitly promotes violence against the members of the targeted community, contributed to a massive surge in anti-Asian crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. While previous works have characterized and built tools for detecting other forms of harmful speech, like fear speech and hate speech, our work takes a community-centric approach to studying anti-Asian violence-provoking speech. Using data from ∼420k Twitter posts spanning a 3-year duration (January 1, 2020 to February 1, 2023), we develop a codebook to characterize anti-Asian violence-provoking speech and collect a community-crowdsourced dataset to facilitate its large-scale detection using state-of-the-art classifiers. We contrast the capabilities of natural language processing classifiers, ranging from BERT-based to LLM-based classifiers, in detecting violence-provoking speech with their capabilities to detect anti-Asian hateful speech. In contrast to prior work that has demonstrated the effectiveness of such classifiers in detecting hateful speech (F1 = 0.89), our work shows that accurate and reliable detection of violence-provoking speech is a challenging task (F1 = 0.69). We discuss the implications of our findings, particularly the need for proactive interventions to support Asian communities during public health crises.",
    "A Comprehensive Evaluation of Quantization Strategies for Large Language Models": "Increasing the number of parameters in large language models (LLMs) usually improves performance in downstream tasks but raises compute and memory costs, making deployment difficult in resource-limited settings. Quantization techniques, which reduce the bits needed for model weights or activations with minimal performance loss, have become popular due to the rise of LLMs. However, most quantization studies use pre-trained LLMs, and the impact of quantization on instruction-tuned LLMs and the relationship between perplexity and benchmark performance of quantized LLMs are not well understood. Evaluation of quantized LLMs is often limited to language modeling and a few classification tasks, leaving their performance on other benchmarks unclear. To address these gaps, we propose a structured evaluation framework consisting of three critical dimensions: (1) knowledge & capacity, (2) alignment, and (3) efficiency, and conduct extensive experiments across ten diverse benchmarks. Our experimental results indicate that LLMs with 4-bit quantization can retain performance comparable to their non-quantized counterparts, and perplexity can serve as a proxy metric for quantized LLMs on most benchmarks. Furthermore, quantized LLMs with larger parameter scales can outperform smaller LLMs. Despite the memory savings achieved through quantization, it can also slow down the inference speed of LLMs. Consequently, substantial engineering efforts and hardware support are imperative to achieve a balanced optimization of decoding speed and memory consumption in the context of quantized LLMs.",
    "A Comprehensive Study of Jailbreak Attack versus Defense for Large Language Models": "Warning:This paper contains unsafe model responses. Large Language Models (LLMs) have increas- ingly become central to generating content with potential societal impacts. Notably, these mod- els have demonstrated capabilities for generat- ing content that could be deemed harmful. To mitigate these risks, researchers have adopted safety training techniques to align model out- puts with societal values to curb the genera- tion of malicious content. However, the phe- nomenon of jailbreaking — where carefully crafted prompts elicit harmful responses from models — persists as a significant challenge. This research conducts a comprehensive anal- ysis of existing studies on jailbreaking LLMs and their defense techniques. We meticulously investigate nine attack techniques and seven de- fense techniques applied across three distinct language models: Vicuna, LLama, and GPT- 3.5 Turbo. We aim to evaluate the effective- ness of these attack and defense techniques. Our findings reveal that existing white-box at- tacks underperform compared to universal tech- niques and that including special tokens in the input significantly affects the likelihood of suc- cessful attacks. This research highlights the need to concentrate on the security facets of LLMs. Additionally, we contribute to the field by releasing our datasets and testing framework, aiming to foster further research into LLM secu- rity. We believe these contributions will facili- tate the exploration of security measures within this domain.",

We describe the task design considerations and report the feedback we received from the students. We expect the task and the findings reported in this paper to be relevant for instructors teaching natural language processing (NLP) and designing course assignments.",
    "A Critical Study of What Code-LLMs (Do Not) Learn": "Large Language Models trained on code corpora (code-LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various coding assistance tasks. However, despite their increased size and training dataset, code-LLMs still have limitations such as suggesting codes with syntactic errors, variable misuse etc. Some studies argue that code-LLMs perform well on coding tasks because they use self-attention and hidden representations to encode relations among input tokens. However, previous works have not studied what code properties are not encoded by code-LLMs. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of attention maps and hidden representations of code-LLMs. Our study indicates that code-LLMs only encode relations among specific subsets of input tokens. Specifically, by categorizing input tokens into syntactic tokens and identifiers, we found that models encode relations among syntactic tokens and among identifiers, but they fail to encode relations between syntactic tokens and identifiers. We also found that fine-tuned models encode these relations poorly compared to their pre-trained counterparts. Additionally, larger models with billions of parameters encode significantly less information about code than models with only a few hundred million parameters.",
    "A Data-Driven Guided Decoding Mechanism for Diagnostic Captioning": "Diagnostic Captioning (DC) automatically generates a diagnostic text from one or more medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs) of a patient. Treated as a draft, the generated text may assist clinicians, by providing an initial estimation of the patient's condition, speeding up and helping safeguard the diagnostic process. The accuracy of a diagnostic text, however, strongly depends on how well the key medical conditions depicted in the images are expressed. We propose a new data-driven guided decoding method that incorporates medical information, in the form of existing tags capturing key conditions of the image(s), into the beam search of the diagnostic text generation process. We evaluate the proposed method on two medical datasets using four DC systems that range from generic image-to-text systems with CNN encoders and RNN decoders to pretrained Large Language Models. The latter can also be used in few- and zero-shot learning scenarios. In most cases, the proposed mechanism improves performance with respect to all evaluation measures. We provide an open-source implementation of the proposed method at https://github.com/nlpaueb/dmmcs.",
    "A Deep Dive into the Trade-Offs of Parameter-Efficient Preference Alignment Techniques": "Large language models are first pre-trained on trillions of tokens and then instruction-tuned or aligned to specific preferences. While pre-training remains out of reach for most researchers due to the compute required, fine-tuning has become affordable thanks to parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA and QLoRA. Alignment is known to be sensitive to the many factors involved, including the quantity and quality of data, the alignment method, and the adapter rank. However, there has not yet been an extensive study of their effect on downstream performance. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the impact of popular choices for three crucial axes: (i) the alignment dataset (HH-RLHF and BeaverTails), (ii) the alignment technique (SFT and DPO), and (iii) the model (LLaMA-1, Vicuna-v1.3, Mistral-7b, and Mistral-7b-Instruct). Our extensive setup spanning over 300 experiments reveals consistent trends and unexpected findings. We observe how more informative data helps with preference alignment, cases where supervised fine-tuning outperforms preference optimization, and how aligning to a distinct preference boosts performance on downstream tasks. Through our in-depth analyses, we put forward key guidelines to help researchers perform more effective parameter-efficient LLM alignment.",
    "A Few-shot Learning Approach for Lexical Semantic Change Detection Using GPT-4": "Lexical Semantic Change Detection (LSCD) aims to detect language change from a diachronic corpus over time. We can see that over the last two decades there has been a surge in research dealing with the LSC Detection. Recently, a series of methods especially contextualized word embeddings have been widely established to address this task. While several studies have investigated LSCD using large language models (LLMs), an evaluation of prompt engineering techniques, such as few-shot learning with different in-context examples for improving the LSCD performance is required. In this study, we examine the few-shot learning ability of GPT-4 to detect semantic changes in the Chinese language change evaluation dataset ChiWUG. We show that our LLM-based solution improves the GCD evaluation metric on the ChiWUG benchmark compared to the previously top-performing pre-trained system. The result suggests that using GPT-4 with three-shot learning with hand-picked demonstrations achieves the best performance among our different prompts.",
    "A Glitch in the Matrix? Locating and Detecting Language Model Grounding with Fakepedia": "Large language models (LLMs) have an impressive ability to draw on novel information supplied in their context. Yet the mechanisms underlying this contextual grounding remain unknown, especially in situations where contextual information contradicts factual knowledge stored in the parameters, which LLMs also excel at recalling. Favoring the contextual information is critical for retrieval-augmented generation methods, which enrich the context with up-to-date information, hoping that grounding can rectify outdated or noisy stored knowledge. We present a novel method to study grounding abilities using Fakepedia, a novel dataset of counterfactual texts constructed to clash with a model's internal parametric knowledge. We benchmark various LLMs with Fakepedia and conduct a causal mediation analysis of LLM components when answering Fakepedia queries, based on our Masked Grouped Causal Tracing (MGCT) method. Through this analysis, we identify distinct computational patterns between grounded and ungrounded responses. We finally demonstrate that distinguishing grounded from ungrounded responses is achievable through computational analysis alone. Our results, together with existing findings about factual recall mechanisms, provide a coherent narrative of how grounding and factual recall mechanisms interact within LLMs.",
    "A Grounded Preference Model for LLM Alignment": "Despite LLMs' recent advancements, they still suffer from factual inconsistency and hallucination. An often-opted remedy is retrieval-augmented generation - however, there is no guarantee that the model will strictly adhere to retrieved grounding. Fundamentally, LLMs need to be aligned to be more faithful to grounding, which will require high-quality preference annotations. This paper investigates whether we can create high-quality grounded preference data for model alignment without using annotations from humans or large proprietary models. We experimented with existing entailment data and proposed approaches to generate synthetic grounded preference data, with which we train a Grounded Preference Model(GPM). We demonstrate through Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO) training of Mistral-7B-Instruct that our GPM model can successfully align powerful LLMs to generate much better grounded responses as judged by GPT4. Moreover, we show that our GPM is also a great faithfulness classifier, achieving SoTA in dialogue sub-tasks of the TRUE faithfulness Benchmark. We release GPM under the Apache 2.0 license.",
    "A Joint Coreference-Aware Approach to Document-Level Target Sentiment Analysis": "Most existing work on aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) focuses on the sentence level, while research at the document level has not received enough attention. Compared to sentence-level ABSA, the document-level ABSA is not only more practical but also requires holistic document-level understanding capabilities such as coreference resolution. To investigate the impact of coreference information on document-level ABSA, we conduct a three-stage research for the document-level target sentiment analysis (DTSA) task: 1) exploring the effectiveness of coreference information for the DTSA task; 2) reducing the reliance on manually annotated coreference information; 3) alleviating the evaluation bias caused by missing the coreference information of opinion targets. Specifically, we first manually annotate the coreferential opinion targets and propose a multi-task learning framework to model the DTSA task and the coreference resolution task jointly. Then we annotate the coreference information with ChatGPT for joint training. Finally, to address the issue of missing coreference targets, we modify the metric from strict matching to a loose matching method based on the clusters of targets. The experimental results demonstrate our framework's effectiveness and reflect the feasibility of using ChatGPT-annotated coreferential entities and the applicability of the modified metric. Our source code is publicly released at https://github.com/NUSTM/DTSA-Coref.",
    "A Matter of Style? Socio-Cultural Differences in Argumentation": "This paper describes the contribution of team GESIS-DSM to the Perspective Argument Retrieval Task, a task on retrieving socio-culturally relevant and diverse arguments for different user queries. Our experiments and analyses aim to explore the nature of the socio-cultural specialization in argument retrieval: (how) do the arguments written by different socio-cultural groups differ? We investigate the impact of content and style for the task of identifying arguments relevant to a query and a certain demographic attribute. In its different configurations, our system employs sentence embedding representations, arguments generated with Large Language Model, as well as stylistic features. Our final method places third overall in the shared task, and, in comparison, does particularly well in the most difficult evaluation scenario, where the socio-cultural background of the argument author is implicit (i.e. has to be inferred from the text). This result indicates that socio-cultural differences in argument production may indeed be a matter of style.",
    "A Meta-Learning Perspective on Transformers for Causal Language Modeling": "The Transformer architecture has become prominent in developing large causal language models. However, mechanisms to explain its capabilities are not well understood. Focused on the training process, here we establish a meta-learning view of the Transformer architecture when trained for the causal language modeling task, by explicating an inner optimization process that may happen within the Transformer. Further, from within the inner optimization, we discover and theoretically analyze a special characteristic of the norms of learned token representations within Transformer-based causal language models. Our analysis is supported by experiments conducted on pre-trained large language models and real-world data.",
    "A multi-level multi-label text classification dataset of 19th century Ottoman and Russian literary and critical texts": "This paper introduces a multi-level, multi-label text classification dataset comprising over 3000 documents. The dataset features literary and critical texts from 19th-century Ottoman Turkish and Russian. It is the first study to apply large language models (LLMs) to this dataset, sourced from prominent literary periodicals of the era. The texts have been meticulously organized and labeled according to a taxonomic framework that takes into account both their structural and semantic attributes. Articles are categorized and tagged with bibliometric metadata by human experts. We present baseline classification results using a classical bag-of-words (BoW) naive Bayes model and three modern LLMs: multilingual BERT, Falcon, and Llama-v2. We found that in certain cases, Bag of Words (BoW) outperforms Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing the need for additional research, especially in low-resource language settings. This dataset is expected to be a valuable resource for researchers in natural language processing and machine learning, especially for historical and low-resource languages. The dataset is publicly available.",
    "A Multi-Task Embedder For Retrieval Augmented LLMs": "LLMs confront inherent limitations in terms of its knowledge, memory, and action. The retrieval augmentation stands as a vital mechanism to address these limitations, which brings in useful information from external sources to augment the LLM. However, existing retrieval methods encounter two pressing issues. On one hand, the general retrievers are not properly optimized for retrieval augmentation hence exhibit limited effectiveness; on the other hand, the task-specific retrievers excel in the targeted retrieval augmentation scenario, while lack the versatility to handle diverse scenarios. In this work, we propose LLM-Embedder for the unified support of diverse retrieval augmentation scenarios. Our method presents three technical contributions. Firstly, we introduce a new reward formulation, namely rank-aware reward. It exploits the ranking position of the desired output among N sampled outputs from the LLM, which leads to fine-grained and robust computation of reward from the LLM's feedback. Secondly, we design a novel distillation objective, called graded distillation. It incorporates both the absolute value and the relative order of the reward for more sufficient utilization of the LLM's feedback. Thirdly, we systematically optimize the multi-task learning, which effectively unifies the multiple retrieval functionalities into one model. In our experiment, LLM-Embedder notably improves the LLM's performances in various downstream tasks, and outperforms both general and task-specific retrievers with a substantial advantage. Our data, code, and model have been released at https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding.",
    "A Parameter-Efficient Multi-Objective Approach to Mitigate Stereotypical Bias in Language Models": "Pre-trained language models have shown impressive abilities of understanding and generating natural languages. However, they typically inherit undesired human-like bias and stereotypes from training data, which raises concerns about putting these models into use in real-world scenarios. Although prior research has proposed to reduce bias using different fairness objectives, they usually fail to capture different representations of bias and, therefore, struggle with fully debiasing models. In this work, we introduce a multi-objective probability alignment approach to overcome current challenges by incorporating multiple debiasing losses to locate and penalize bias in different forms. Compared to existing methods, our proposed method can more effectively and comprehensively reduce stereotypical bias, and maintains the language ability of pre-trained models at the same time. Besides, we adopt prefix-tuning to optimize fairness objectives, and results show that it can achieve better bias removal than full fine-tuning while requiring much fewer computational resources. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Ewanwong/debias_NLG.",
    "A Privacy-preserving Approach to Ingest Knowledge from Proprietary Web-based to Locally Run Models for Medical Progress Note Generation": "Clinical documentation is correlated with increasing clinician burden, leading to the rise of automated methods to generate medical notes. Due to the sensitive nature of patient electronic health records (EHRs), locally run models are preferred for a variety of reasons including privacy, bias, and cost. However, most open-source locally run models (including medical-specific) are much smaller with limited input context size compared to the more powerful closed-source large language models (LLMs) generally available through web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). In this paper, we propose a framework to harness superior reasoning capabilities and medical knowledge from closed-source online LLMs in a privacy-preserving manner and seamlessly incorporate it into locally run models. Specifically, we leverage a web-based model to distill the vast patient information available in EHRs into a clinically relevant subset without sending sensitive patient health information online and use this distilled knowledge to generate progress notes by a locally run model. Our ablation results indicate that the proposed framework improves the performance of the Mixtral model on progress note generation by 4.6 points on ROUGE (a text-matching based metric) and 7.56 points on MEDCON F1 (a metric that measures the clinical concepts overlap).",
    "A Prompting Assignment for Exploring Pretrained LLMs": "This paper presents an assignment that asks students to explore three aspects of large language model capabilities (commonsense reasoning, factuality, and wordplay) with a prompt engineering focus. The assignment consists of three tasks designed to share a common programming framework, allowing students to reuse and adapt code from earlier tasks. Two of the tasks also involve dataset construction: students are asked to construct a simple dataset for the wordplay task and a more challenging dataset for the factuality task. In addition, the assignment includes reflection questions that ask students to think critically about what they observe.",
    "A Sentiment Consolidation Framework for Meta-Review Generation": "Modern natural language generation systems with Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit the capability to generate a plausible summary of multiple documents; however, it is uncertain if they truly possess the capability of information consolidation to generate summaries, especially on documents with opinionated information. We focus on meta-review generation, a form of sentiment summarisation for the scientific domain. To make scientific sentiment summarization more grounded, we hypothesize that human meta-reviewers follow a three-layer framework of sentiment consolidation to write meta-reviews. Based on the framework, we propose novel prompting methods for LLMs to generate meta-reviews and evaluation metrics to assess the quality of generated meta-reviews. Our framework is validated empirically as we find that prompting LLMs based on the framework — compared with prompting them with simple instructions — generates better meta-reviews.",
    "A Ship of Theseus: Curious Cases of Paraphrasing in LLM-Generated Texts": "In the realm of text manipulation and linguistic transformation, the question of authorship has been a subject of fascination and philosophical inquiry. Much like the Ship of Theseus paradox, which ponders whether a ship remains the same when each of its original planks is replaced, our research delves into an intriguing question: Does a text retain its original authorship when it undergoes numerous paraphrasing iterations? Specifically, since Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in both the generation of original content and the modification of human-authored texts, a pivotal question emerges concerning the determination of authorship in instances where LLMs or similar paraphrasing tools are employed to rephrase the text-i.e., whether authorship should be attributed to the original human author or the AI-powered tool. Therefore, we embark on a philosophical voyage through the seas of language and authorship to unravel this intricate puzzle. Using a computational approach, we discover that the diminishing performance in text classification models, with each successive paraphrasing iteration, is closely associated with the extent of deviation from the original author's style, thus provoking a reconsideration of the current notion of authorship.",
    "A Survey of Chain of Thought Reasoning: Advances, Frontiers and Future": "Reasoning, a fundamental cognitive process integral to human intelligence, has garnered substantial interest within artificial intelligence. Notably, recent studies have revealed that chain-of-thought prompting significantly enhances LLM's reasoning capabilities, which attracts widespread attention from both academics and industry. In this paper, we systematically investigate relevant research, summarizing advanced methods through a meticulous taxonomy that offers novel perspectives. Moreover, we delve into the current frontiers and delineate the challenges and future directions, thereby shedding light on future research. Furthermore, we engage in a discussion about open questions. We hope this paper serves as an introduction for beginners and fosters future research.",
    "A Synthetic Data Approach for Domain Generalization of NLI Models": "Natural Language Inference (NLI) remains an important benchmark task for LLMs. NLI datasets are a springboard for transfer learning to other semantic tasks, and NLI models are standard tools for identifying the faithfulness of model-generated text. There are several large scale NLI datasets today, and models have improved greatly by hill-climbing on these collections. Yet their realistic performance on out-of-distribution/domain data is less well-understood. We explore the opportunity for synthetic high-quality datasets to adapt NLI models for zero-shot use in downstream applications across new and unseen text domains. We demonstrate a new approach for generating NLI data in diverse domains and lengths, so far not covered by existing training sets. The resulting examples have meaningful premises, the hypotheses are formed in creative ways rather than simple edits to a few premise tokens, and the labels have high accuracy. We show that models trained on this data (685K synthetic examples) have the best generalization to completely new downstream test settings. On the TRUE benchmark, a T5-small model trained with our data improves around 7% on average compared to training on the best alternative dataset. The improvements are more pronounced for smaller models, while still meaningful on a T5 XXL model. We also demonstrate gains on test sets when in-domain training data is augmented with our domain-general synthetic data.",
    "A Tale of Two Revisions: Summarizing Changes Across Document Versions": "Document revision is a crucial aspect of the writing process, particularly in collaborative environments where multiple authors contribute simultaneously. However, current tools lack an efficient way to provide a comprehensive overview of changes between versions, leading to difficulties in understanding revisions. To address this, we propose a novel task of providing thematic summary of changes between document versions, organizing individual edits based on shared themes. We assess capabilities of LLMs on this task and further introduce three strategies to tackle this task: (i) representing the input of two documents along with edits in the 'diff' format (ii) a two-stage task decomposition with individual edit description generation as an intermediate task and (iii) clustering based chunking and subsequent merging techniques for handling longer documents. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the model's capacity to handle this complex task. Additionally, we introduce ChangeSumm, a curated dataset comprising human-written thematic summaries for pairs of document versions, to facilitate evaluation and further research in this direction.",
    "A Taxonomy for Data Contamination in Large Language Models": "Large language models pretrained on extensive web corpora demonstrate remarkable performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, a growing concern is data contamination, where evaluation datasets may be contained in the pretraining corpus, inflating model performance. Decontamination, the process of detecting and removing such data, is a potential solution; yet these contaminants may originate from altered versions of the test set, evading detection during decontamination. How different types of contamination impact the performance of language models on downstream tasks is not fully understood. We present a taxonomy that categorizes the various types of contamination encountered by LLMs during the pretraining phase and identify which types pose the highest risk. We analyze the impact of contamination on two key NLP tasks—summarization and question answering—revealing how different types of contamination influence task performance during evaluation.",
    "A Two-Agent Game for Zero-shot Relation Triplet Extraction": "Relation triplet extraction is a fundamental task in natural language processing that aims to identify semantic relationships between entities in text. It is particularly challenging in the zero-shot setting, i.e., zero-shot relation triplet extraction (ZeroRTE), where the relation sets between training and test are disjoint. Existing methods deal with this task by integrating relations into prompts, which may lack sufficient understanding of the unseen relations. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel Two-Agent Game (TAG) approach to deliberate and debate the semantics of unseen relations. TAG consists of two agents, a generator and an extractor. They iteratively interact in three key steps: attempting, criticizing, and rectifying. This enables the agents to fully debate and understand the unseen relations. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvement over ALBERT-Large, BART, and GPT3.5*, without incurring additional inference costs in all cases. Remarkably, our method outperforms strong baselines by a significant margin, achieving an impressive 6%-16% increase in F1 scores, particularly when dealing with FewRel with five unseen relations†.",
    "A Two-Stage Adaptation of Large Language Models for Text Ranking": "Text ranking is a critical task in information retrieval. Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs), especially large language models (LLMs), present new opportunities for applying them to text ranking. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with ranking data has been widely explored to better align PLMs with text ranking goals, previous studies have focused primarily on encoder-only and encoder-decoder PLMs. Research on leveraging decoder-only LLMs for text ranking remains scarce. An exception to this is RankLLaMA (Ma et al., 2023a), which uses direct SFT to explore LLaMA's potential for text ranking. In this work, we propose a two-stage progressive paradigm to better adapt LLMs to text ranking. First, we conduct continual pre-training (CPT) of LLMs on a large weakly-supervised corpus. Second, we perform SFT, and propose an improved optimization strategy building upon RankLLaMA. Our experimental results on multiple benchmarks show that our approach outperforms previous methods in both in-domain and out-domain scenarios.",
    "ABSINSTRUCT: Eliciting Abstraction Ability from LLMs through Explanation Tuning with Plausibility Estimation": "Abstraction ability is crucial in human intelligence, which can also benefit various tasks in NLP study. Existing work shows that LLMs are deficient in abstract ability, and how to improve it remains unexplored. In this work, we design the framework ABSINSTRUCT to enhance LLMs' abstraction ability through instruction tuning. The framework builds instructions with in-depth explanations to assist LLMs in capturing the underlying rationale of abstraction. Meanwhile, we introduce a plausibility estimator to select instructions that are more consistent with the abstraction knowledge of LLMs to be aligned. Then, our framework combines abstraction instructions with general-purpose ones to build a hybrid dataset. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our framework can considerably enhance LLMs' abstraction ability with strong generalization performance while maintaining their general instruction-following abilities.",
    "Abstract Meaning Representation-Based Logic-Driven Data Augmentation for Logical Reasoning": "Combining large language models with logical reasoning enhances their capacity to address problems in a robust and reliable manner. Nevertheless, the intricate nature of logical reasoning poses challenges when gathering reliable data from the web to build comprehensive training datasets, subsequently affecting performance on downstream tasks. To address this, we introduce a novel logic-driven data augmentation approach, AMR-LDA. AMR-LDA converts the original text into an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph, a structured semantic representation that encapsulates the logical structure of the sentence, upon which operations are performed to generate logically modified AMR graphs. The modified AMR graphs are subsequently converted back into text to create augmented data. Notably, our methodology is architecture-agnostic and enhances both generative large language models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, through prompt augmentation, and discriminative large language models through contrastive learning with logic-driven data augmentation. Empirical evidence underscores the efficacy of our proposed method with improvement in performance across seven downstream tasks, such as reading comprehension requiring logical reasoning, textual entailment, and natural language inference. Furthermore, our method leads on the ReClor leaderboard. The source code and data are publicly available.",
    "Accelerating Multilingual Language Model for Excessively Tokenized Languages": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have remarkably enhanced performances on a variety of tasks in multiple languages. However, tokenizers in LLMs trained primarily on English-centric corpora often overly fragment a text into character or Unicode-level tokens in non-Roman alphabetic languages, leading to inefficient text generation. We introduce a simple yet effective framework to accelerate text generation in such languages. Our approach involves employing a new language model head with a vocabulary set tailored to a specific target language for a pre-trained LLM. This is followed by fine-tuning the new head while incorporating a verification step to ensure the model's performance is preserved. We show that this targeted fine-tuning, while freezing other model parameters, effectively reduces token fragmentation for the target language. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework increases the generation speed by a factor of 1.7 while maintaining the performance of pre-trained multilingual models on target monolingual tasks.",
    "Accurate and Nuanced Open-QA Evaluation Through Textual Entailment": "Open-domain question answering (Open-QA) is a common task for evaluating large language models (LLMs). However, current Open-QA evaluations are criticized for the ambiguity in questions and the lack of semantic understanding in evaluators. Complex evaluators, powered by foundation models or LLMs and pertaining to semantic equivalence, still deviate from human judgments by a large margin. We propose to study the entailment relations of answers to identify more informative and more general system answers, offering a much closer evaluation to human judgment on both NaturalQuestions and TriviaQA while being learning-free. The entailment-based evaluation we propose allows the assignment of bonus or partial marks by quantifying the inference gap between answers, enabling a nuanced ranking of answer correctness that has higher AUC than current methods.",
    "Acquiring Clean Language Models from Backdoor Poisoned Datasets by Downscaling Frequency Space": "Despite the notable success of language models (LMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the reliability of LMs is susceptible to backdoor attacks. Prior research attempts to mitigate backdoor learning while training the LMs on the poisoned dataset, yet struggles against complex backdoor attacks in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the learning mechanisms of backdoor LMs in the frequency space by Fourier analysis. Our findings indicate that the backdoor mapping presented on the poisoned datasets exhibits a more discernible inclination towards lower frequency compared to clean mapping, resulting in the faster convergence of backdoor mapping. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Multi-Scale Low-Rank Adaptation (MuScleLoRA), which deploys multiple radial scalings in the frequency space with low-rank adaptation to the target model and further aligns the gradients when updating parameters. Through downscaling in the frequency space, MuScleLoRA encourages the model to prioritize the learning of relatively high-frequency clean mapping, consequently mitigating backdoor learning. Experimental results demonstrate that MuScleLoRA outperforms baselines significantly. Notably, MuScleLoRA reduces the average success rate of diverse backdoor attacks to below 15% across multiple datasets and generalizes to various backbone LMs, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT2-XL, and Llama2. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/ZrW00/MuScleLoRA.",
    "ActionIE: Action Extraction from Scientific Literature with Programming Languages": "Extraction of experimental procedures from human language in scientific literature and patents into actionable sequences in robotics language holds immense significance in scientific domains. Such an action extraction task is particularly challenging given the intricate details and context-dependent nature of the instructions, especially in fields like chemistry where reproducibility is paramount. In this paper, we introduce ACTIONIE, a method that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to bridge this divide by converting actions written in natural language into executable Python code. This enables us to capture the entities of interest, and the relationship between each action, given the features of Programming Languages. Utilizing linguistic cues identified by frequent patterns, ActionIE provides an improved mechanism to discern entities of interest. While our method is broadly applicable, we exemplify its power in the domain of chemical literature, wherein we focus on extracting experimental procedures for chemical synthesis. The code generated by our method can be easily transformed into robotics language which is in high demand in scientific fields. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. In addition, we propose a graph-based metric to more accurately reflect the precision of extraction. We also develop a dataset to address the scarcity of scientific literature occurred in existing datasets.",
    "Active Prompting with Chain-of-Thought for Large Language Models": "The increasing scale of large language models (LLMs) brings emergent abilities to various complex tasks requiring reasoning, such as arithmetic and commonsense reasoning. It is known that the effective design of task-specific prompts is critical for LLMs' ability to produce high-quality answers. In particular, an effective approach for complex question-and-answering tasks is example-based prompting with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which significantly improves the performance of LLMs. However, current CoT methods rely on a fixed set of human-annotated exemplars, which are not necessarily the most effective examples for different tasks. This paper proposes a new method, Active-Prompt, to adapt LLMs to different tasks with task-specific example prompts (annotated with human-designed CoT reasoning). For this purpose, we propose a solution to the key problem of determining which questions are the most important and helpful to annotate from a pool of task-specific queries. By borrowing ideas from the related problem of uncertainty-based active learning, we introduce several metrics to characterize the uncertainty so as to select the most uncertain questions for annotation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving superior performance on eight complex reasoning tasks. Further analyses of different uncertainty metrics, pool sizes, zero-shot learning, and accuracy-uncertainty relationships demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",
    "ACUEVAL: Fine-grained Hallucination Evaluation and Correction for Abstractive Summarization": "The impressive generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have made it harder to detect the subtle hallucinations they make in abstractive summarization, where generated summaries consist of a blend of correct and incorrect information w.r.t. a given document. Recently-proposed LLM-based evaluation metrics attempt to capture this, but still face challenges: (1) they are biased towards summaries generated from the same underlying LLM, and (2) they lack interpretability, offering only a single score. In this work, we present ACUEVAL, a metric that leverages the power of LLMs to perform two sub-tasks: decomposing summaries into atomic content units (ACUs), and validating them against the source document. Compared to current strong LLM-based metrics, our two-step evaluation strategy improves correlation with human judgments of faithfulness on three summarization evaluation benchmarks by 3% in balanced accuracy compared to the next-best metric, and also shows reduced preference bias towards LLM-generated summary. Further, we show that errors detected by ACUEVAL can be used to generate actionable feedback for refining the summary, improving the faithfulness scores by more than 10%.",
    "AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate": "Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive parameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a high threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO) reduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic gradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal convergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for large language models, AdamW. Through analysis of the Adam optimizer, we found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more critical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter and exhibits superior convergence performance compared to LOMO theoretically. To maintain memory efficiency, we employ non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update normalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments on instruction-tuning, further pre-training and from-scratch pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models. The code is accessible at https://github.com/OpenLMLab/LOMO.",
    "Adapting Multilingual LLMs to Low-Resource Languages with Knowledge Graphs via Adapters": "This paper explores the integration of graph knowledge from linguistic ontologies into multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) using adapters to improve performance for low-resource languages (LRLs) in sentiment analysis (SA) and named entity recognition (NER). Building upon successful parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as K-ADAPTER (Wang et al., 2021) and MAD-X (Pfeiffer et al., 2020), we propose a similar approach for incorporating knowledge from multilingual graphs, connecting concepts in various languages with each other through linguistic relationships, into multilingual LLMs for LRLs. Specifically, we focus on eight LRLs —Maltese, Bulgarian, Indonesian, Nepali, Javanese, Uyghur, Tibetan, and Sinhala — and employ language-specific adapters fine-tuned on data extracted from the language-specific section of ConceptNet, aiming to enable knowledge transfer across the languages covered by the knowledge graph. We compare various fine-tuning objectives, including standard Masked Language Modeling (MLM), MLM with full-word masking, and MLM with targeted masking, to analyze their effectiveness in learning and integrating the extracted graph data. Through empirical evaluation on language-specific tasks, we assess how structured graph knowledge affects the performance of multilingual LLMs for LRLs in SA and NER, providing insights into the potential benefits of adapting language models for low-resource scenarios.",
    "Addressing Order Sensitivity of In-Context Demonstration Examples in Causal Language Models": "In-context learning has become a popular paradigm in natural language processing. However, its performance can be significantly influenced by the order of in-context demonstration examples. In this paper, we found that causal language models (CausalLMs) are more sensitive to this order compared to prefix language models (PrefixLMs). We attribute this phenomenon to the auto-regressive attention masks within CausalLMs, which restrict each token from accessing information from subsequent tokens. This results in different receptive fields for samples at different positions, thereby leading to representation disparities across positions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an unsupervised fine-tuning method, termed the Information-Augmented and Consistency-Enhanced approach. This approach utilizes contrastive learning to align representations of in-context examples across different positions and introduces a consistency loss to ensure similar representations for inputs with different permutations. This enhances the model's predictive consistency across permutations. Experimental results on five benchmarks suggest that our proposed method can reduce the sensitivity of CausalLMs to the order of in-context examples and exhibit robust generalizability, particularly when demonstrations are sourced from a candidate pool different from that used in the training phase, or when the number of in-context examples differs from what is used during training.",
    "Advancement in Graph Understanding: A Multimodal Benchmark and Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models": "Graph data organizes complex relationships and interactions between objects, facilitating advanced analysis and decision-making across different fields. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for interactive and instructional graph data understanding and reasoning. Instead of adopting complex graph neural models or heuristic graph-to-text instruction design, we leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to encode the graph images with varying structures across different domains. This paper first evaluates the capabilities of public VLMs in graph learning from multiple aspects. Then it introduces a novel instruction-following dataset for multimodal graph understanding and reasoning in English and Chinese. Besides, by fine-tuning MiniGPT-4 and LLaVA on our dataset, we achieved an accuracy increase of 5%-15% compared to baseline models, with the best-performing model attaining scores comparable to Gemini in GPT-assisted Evaluation. This research not only showcases the potential of integrating VLMs with graph data but also opens new avenues for advancement in graph data understanding.",
    "Advancing Healthcare Automation: Multi-Agent System for Medical Necessity Justification": "Prior Authorization delivers safe, appropriate, and cost-effective care that is medically justified with evidence-based guidelines. However, the process often requires labor-intensive manual comparisons between patient medical records and clinical guidelines, that is both repetitive and time-consuming. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in addressing complex medical NLP tasks with minimal supervision. This paper explores the application of Multi-Agent System (MAS) that utilize specialized LLM agents to automate Prior Authorization task by breaking them down into simpler and manageable sub-tasks. Our study systematically investigates the effects of various prompting strategies on these agents and benchmarks the performance of different LLMs. We demonstrate that GPT-4 achieves an accuracy of 86.2% in predicting checklist item-level judgments with evidence, and 95.6% in determining overall checklist judgment. Additionally, we explore how these agents can contribute to explainability of steps taken in the process, thereby enhancing trust and transparency in the system.",
    "Advancing Large Language Models to Capture Varied Speaking Styles and Respond Properly in Spoken Conversations": "In spoken dialogue, even if two current turns are the same sentence, their responses might still differ when they are spoken in different styles. The spoken styles, containing paralinguistic and prosodic information, mark the most significant difference between text and speech modality. When using text-only LLMs to model spoken dialogue, text-only LLMs cannot give different responses based on the speaking style of the current turn. In this paper, we focus on enabling LLMs to listen to the speaking styles and respond properly. Our goal is to teach the LLM that even if the sentences are identical if they are spoken in different styles, their corresponding responses might be different. Since there is no suitable dataset for achieving this goal, we collect a speech-to-speech dataset, StyleTalk, with the following desired characteristics: when two current speeches have the same content but are spoken in different styles, their responses will be different. To teach LLMs to understand and respond properly to the speaking styles, we propose the Spoken-LLM framework that can model the linguistic content and the speaking styles. We train Spoken-LLM using the StyleTalk dataset and devise a two-stage training pipeline to help the Spoken-LLM better learn the speaking styles. Based on extensive experiments, we show that Spoken-LLM outperforms text-only baselines and prior speech LLMs methods.",
    "Advancing Parameter Efficiency in Fine-tuning via Representation Editing": "Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques have drawn significant attention due to their ability to yield competitive results while updating only a small portion of the adjustable parameters. However, existing PEFT methods pose challenges in hyperparameter selection, such as choosing the rank for LoRA or Adapter, or specifying the length of soft prompts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach for neural models, named Representation EDiting (RED), which modifies the representations generated at some layers through the application of scaling and biasing operations. While existing PEFT methods still demonstrate over-parameterization that could potentially undermine the generalization ability acquired from pre-training, RED can substantially reduce the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 25,700 compared to full parameter fine-tuning and by a factor of 32 relative to LoRA. Remarkably, RED achieves results comparable or superior to both full parameter fine-tuning and other PEFT methods. Extensive experiments across various model architectures and scales, including RoBERTa, GPT-2, T5, and LLaMA-2, have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of RED, thereby positioning it as a promising PEFT strategy for large-scale neural models.",
    "Adversarial Preference Optimization: Enhancing Your Alignment via RM-LLM Game": "Human preference alignment is essential to improve the interaction quality of large language models (LLMs). Existing alignment methods depend on manually annotated preference data to guide the LLM optimization directions. However, continuously updating LLMs for alignment raises a distribution gap between model-generated samples and human-annotated responses, hindering training effectiveness. To mitigate this issue, previous methods require additional preference annotation on newly generated samples to adapt to the shifted distribution, which consumes a large amount of annotation resources. Targeting more efficient human preference optimization, we propose an Adversarial Preference Optimization (APO) framework, in which the LLM and the reward model update alternatively via a min-max game. Through adversarial training, the reward model can adapt to the shifted generation distribution of the LLM without any additional annotation. With comprehensive experiments, we find the proposed adversarial training framework further enhances existing alignment baselines in terms of LLM helpfulness and harmlessness. The code is at https://github.com/Linear95/APO.",
    "AFaCTA: Assisting the Annotation of Factual Claim Detection with Reliable LLM Annotators": "With the rise of generative AI, automated fact-checking methods to combat misinformation are becoming more and more important. However, factual claim detection, the first step in a fact-checking pipeline, suffers from two key issues that limit its scalability and generalizability: (1) inconsistency in definitions of the task and what a claim is, and (2) the high cost of manual annotation. To address (1), we review the definitions in related work and propose a unifying definition of factual claims that focuses on verifiability. To address (2), we introduce AFaCTA (Automatic Factual Claim deTection Annotator), a novel framework that assists in the annotation of factual claims with the help of large language models (LLMs). AFaCTA calibrates its annotation confidence with consistency along three predefined reasoning paths. Extensive evaluation and experiments in the domain of political speech reveal that AFaCTA can efficiently assist experts in annotating factual claims and training high-quality classifiers, and can work with or without expert supervision. Our analyses also result in PoliClaim, a comprehensive claim detection dataset spanning diverse political topics.",
    "AFPQ: Asymmetric Floating Point Quantization for LLMs": "Large language models (LLMs) show great performance in various tasks, but face deployment challenges from limited memory capacity and bandwidth. Low-bit weight quantization can save memory and accelerate inference. Although floating-point (FP) formats show good performance in LLM quantization, they tend to perform poorly with small group sizes or sub-4 bits. We find the reason is that the absence of asymmetry in previous FP quantization makes it unsuitable for handling asymmetric value distribution of LLM weight tensors. In this work, we propose asymmetric FP quantization (AFPQ), which sets separate scales for positive and negative values. Our method leads to large accuracy improvements and can be easily plugged into other quantization methods, including GPTQ and AWQ, for better performance. Besides, no additional storage is needed compared with asymmetric integer (INT) quantization. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangsichengsjtu/AFPQ.",
    "AGB-DE: A Corpus for the Automated Legal Assessment of Clauses in German Consumer Contracts": "Legal tasks and datasets are often used as benchmarks for the capabilities of language models. However, openly available annotated datasets are rare. In this paper, we introduce AGB-DE, a corpus of 3,764 clauses from German consumer contracts that have been annotated and legally assessed by legal experts. Together with the data, we present a first baseline for the task of detecting potentially void clauses, comparing the performance of an SVM baseline with three fine-tuned open language models and the performance of GPT-3.5. Our results show the challenging nature of the task, with no approach exceeding an F1-score of 0.54. While the fine-tuned models often performed better with regard to precision, GPT-3.5 outperformed the other approaches with regard to recall. An analysis of the errors indicates that one of the main challenges could be the correct interpretation of complex clauses, rather than the decision boundaries of what is permissible and what is not.",
    "Agent LUMOS: Unified and Modular Training for Open-Source Language Agents": "Closed-source agents suffer from several issues such as a lack of affordability, transparency, and reproducibility, particularly on complex interactive tasks. This motivates the development of open-source alternatives. We introduce LUMOS, one of the first frameworks for training open-source LLM-based agents. LUMOS features a learnable, unified and modular architecture with a planning module that learns high-level subgoal generation, and a grounding module trained to translate these into the actions using various tools in the execution module. The design allows for modular upgrades and wider applicability to diverse interactive tasks. To foster generalizable agent learning, we collect large-scale, unified, and high-quality training annotations derived from diverse ground-truth reasoning rationales across various complex interactive tasks. On 9 datasets, LUMOS exhibits several key advantages: (1) LUMOS excels multiple larger open-source agents on the held-out datasets (unused for training) for each task type. LUMOS even surpasses GPT agents on QA and web tasks; (2) LUMOS outperforms open-source agents produced by chain-of-thoughts and unmodularized integrated training; and (3) LUMOS effectively generalizes to unseen tasks, outperforming 33B-scale agents and domain-specific agents. Code and data will be released.",
    "Agent-FLAN: Designing Data and Methods of Effective Agent Tuning for Large Language Models": "Open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved great success in various NLP tasks, however, they are still far inferior to API-based models when acting as agents. How to integrate agent ability into general LLMs becomes a crucial and urgent problem. This paper first delivers three key observations: (1) the current agent training corpus is entangled with both formats following and agent reasoning, which significantly shifts from the distribution of its pre-training data; (2) LLMs exhibit different learning speeds on the capabilities required by agent tasks; and (3) current approaches have side-effects when improving agent abilities by introducing hallucinations. Based on the above findings, we propose Agent-FLAN to effectively Fine-tune LANguage models for Agents. Through careful decomposition and redesign of the training corpus, Agent-FLAN enables Llama2-7B to outperform prior best works by 3.5% across various agent evaluation datasets. With comprehensively constructed negative samples, Agent-FLAN greatly alleviates the hallucination issues based on our established evaluation benchmark. Besides, it consistently improves the agent capability of LLMs when scaling model sizes while slightly enhancing the general capability of LLMs. The code and model are available at https://github.com/InternLM/Agent-FLAN.",
    "Agent-Pro: Learning to Evolve via Policy-Level Reflection and Optimization": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit robust problem-solving capabilities for diverse tasks. However, most LLM-based agents are designed as specific task solvers with sophisticated prompt engineering, rather than agents capable of learning and evolving through interactions. These task solvers necessitate manually crafted prompts to inform task rules and regulate LLM behaviors, inherently incapacitating to address complex dynamic scenarios, e.g., large interactive games. In light of this, we propose Agent-Pro: an LLM-based Agent with Policy-level Reflection and Optimization that can learn a wealth of expertise from interactive experiences and progressively elevate its behavioral policy. Specifically, it involves a dynamic belief generation and reflection process for policy evolution. Rather than action-level reflection, Agent-Pro iteratively reflects on past trajectories and beliefs, fine-tuning its irrational beliefs for a better policy. Moreover, a depth-first search is employed for policy optimization, ensuring continual enhancement in policy payoffs. Agent-Pro is evaluated across two games: Blackjack and Texas Hold'em, outperforming vanilla LLM and specialized models. Our results show Agent-Pro can learn and evolve in complex and dynamic scenes, which also benefits numerous LLM-based applications.",
    "AgentTuning: Enabling Generalized Agent Abilities for LLMs": "Open large language models (LLMs) have thus far been inferior to commercial LLMs when acting as agents to tackle complex tasks. These agent tasks employ LLMs as the central controller responsible for planning, memorization, and tool utilization. To date, there is a lack of research focusing on improving the agent capabilities of LLMs themselves. In this work, we present AgentTuning, a simple and general method to enhance the agent abilities of LLMs while maintaining their general LLM capabilities. We construct AgentInstruct, a lightweight instruction-tuning dataset containing high-quality interaction trajectories. We employ a hybrid instruction-tuning strategy by combining AgentInstruct with open-source instructions from general domains. AgentTuning is used to instruction-tune the Llama 2 series, resulting in AgentLM. Evaluations show that AgentTuning enables LLMs' agent capabilities without compromising general abilities. The AgentLM-70B is comparable to GPT-3.5-turbo on unseen agent tasks, demonstrating generalized agent capabilities. We open source the AgentInstruct dataset and AgentLM-7B, 13B, and 70B models at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AgentTuning.",
    "Aggregating Impressions on Celebrities and their Reasons from Microblog Posts and Web Search Pages by LLMs": "This paper aims to augment fans' ability to critique and explore information related to celebrities of interest. First, we collect posts from X (formerly Twitter) that discuss matters related to specific celebrities. For the collection of major impressions from these posts, we employ ChatGPT as a large language model (LLM) to analyze and summarize key sentiments. Next, based on collected impressions, we search for Web pages and collect the content of the top 30 ranked pages as the source for exploring the reasons behind those impressions. Once the Web page content collection is complete, we collect and aggregate detailed reasons for the impressions on the celebrities from the content of each page. For this part, we continue to use ChatGPT, enhanced by the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) framework, to ensure the reliability of the collected results compared to relying solely on the prior knowledge of the LLM. Evaluation results by comparing a reference that is manually collected and aggregated reasons with those predicted by ChatGPT revealed that ChatGPT achieves high accuracy in reason collection and aggregation. Furthermore, we compared the performance of ChatGPT with an existing model of mT5 in reason collection and confirmed that ChatGPT exhibits superior performance.",
    "AI 'News' Content Farms Are Easy to Make and Hard to Detect: A Case Study in Italian": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as 'content farm' models (CFMs), to generate synthetic text that could pass for real news articles. This is already happening even for languages that do not have high-quality monolingual LLMs. We show that fine-tuning Llama (v1), mostly trained on English, on as little as 40K Italian news articles, is sufficient for producing news-like texts that native speakers of Italian struggle to identify as synthetic. We investigate three LLMs and three methods of detecting synthetic texts (log-likelihood, DetectGPT, and supervised classification), finding that they all perform better than human raters, but they are all impractical in the real world (requiring either access to token likelihood information or a large dataset of CFM texts). We also explore the possibility of creating a proxy CFM: an LLM fine-tuned on a similar dataset to one used by the real 'content farm'. We find that even a small amount of fine-tuning data suffices for creating a successful detector, but we need to know which base LLM is used, which is a major challenge. Our results suggest that there are currently no practical methods for detecting synthetic news-like texts 'in the wild', while generating them is too easy. We highlight the urgency of more NLP research on this problem.",
    "AIR-Bench: Benchmarking Large Audio-Language Models via Generative Comprehension": "Recently, instruction-following audio-language models have received broad attention for human-audio interaction. However, the absence of benchmarks capable of evaluating audio-centric interaction capabilities has impeded advancements in this field. Previous models primarily focus on assessing different fundamental tasks, such as automatic speech recognition, and lack an assessment of the open-ended generative capabilities centered around audio. Thus, it is challenging to track the progression in the Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) domain and to provide guidance for future improvement. In this paper, we introduce AIR-Bench (Audio InstRuction Benchmark), the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LALMs to understand various types of audio signals (including human speech, natural sounds, and music), and furthermore, to interact with humans in the textual format. AIR-Bench encompasses two dimensions: foundation and chat benchmarks. The former consists of 19 tasks with approximately 19k single-choice questions, intending to inspect the basic single-task ability of LALMs. The latter one contains 2k instances of open-ended question-and-answer data, directly assessing the comprehension of the model on complex audio and its capacity to follow instructions. Both benchmarks require the model to generate hypotheses directly. We design a unified framework that leverages advanced language models, such as GPT-4, to evaluate the scores of generated hypotheses given the meta-information of the audio. Experimental results demonstrate a high level of consistency between GPT-4-based evaluation and human evaluation. By revealing the limitations of existing LALMs through evaluation results, AIR-Bench can provide insights into the direction of future research.",
    "AIRI at RRG24: LLaVa with specialised encoder and decoder": "We present a new approach to generating the “Findings” and “Impression” sections in the chest X-rays radiology reports, developed as part of the shared radiology task at BioNLP 2024. By integrating a DINOv2 vision encoder trained on medical data with specialized biomedical large language model using the LLaVA framework, our method addresses complex medical semantics and diverse findings in imaging. We use datasets from PadChest, BIMCV-COVID19, CheXpert, OpenI, and MIMIC-CXR. The evaluation metrics demonstrate our method's effectiveness and the potential for automating the generation of radiology reports.",
    "ALARM: Align Language Models via Hierarchical Rewards Modeling": "We introduce ALARM, the first framework modeling hierarchical rewards in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which is designed to enhance the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. The framework addresses the limitations of current alignment approaches, which often struggle with the inconsistency and sparsity of human supervision signals, by integrating holistic rewards with aspect-specific rewards. This integration enables more precise and consistent guidance of language models towards desired outcomes, particularly in complex and open text generation tasks. By employing a methodology that filters and combines multiple rewards based on their consistency, the framework provides a reliable mechanism for improving model alignment. We validate our approach through applications in long-form question answering and machine translation tasks, employing gpt-3.5-turbo for pairwise comparisons, and demonstrate improvements over existing baselines. Our work underscores the effectiveness of hierarchical rewards modeling in refining LLM training processes for better human preference alignment. We release our code at https://ALaRM-fdu.github.io.",

In this paper, we outline our work for the ArAIEval Shared Task2 in ArabicNLP 2024. This study introduces a method for identifying propaganda in Arabic memes using a multimodal system that combines textual and visual indicators to enhance the result. Our approach achieves the first place in text classification with Macro-F1 of 78.69%, the third place in image classification with Macro-F1 of 65.92%, and the first place in multimodal classification with Macro-F1 of 80.51%.",
    "AlignBench: Benchmarking Chinese Alignment of Large Language Models": "Alignment has become a critical step for instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to become helpful assistants. However, the effective evaluation of alignment for emerging Chinese LLMs is still significantly lacking, calling for real-scenario grounded, open-ended, challenging and automatic evaluations tailored for alignment. To fill in this gap, we introduce ALIGNBENCH, a comprehensive multi-dimensional benchmark for evaluating LLMs' alignment in Chinese. We tailor a human-in-the-loop data curation pipeline, containing 8 main categories, 683 real-scenario rooted queries and corresponding human verified references. To ensure the correctness of references, each knowledge-intensive query is accompanied with evidences collected from reliable web sources (including URLs and quotations) by our annotators. For automatic evaluation, our benchmark employs a rule-calibrated multi-dimensional LLM-as-Judge (Zheng et al., 2023) approach with Chain-of-Thought to generate explanations and final ratings, ensuring high reliability and interpretability. All evaluation codes, data, and LLM generations are available at https://github.com/THUDM/AlignBench.",
    "Aligning Large Language Models by On-Policy Self-Judgment": "Existing approaches for aligning large language models with human preferences face a trade-off that requires a separate reward model (RM) for on-policy learning. In this paper, we present a novel alignment framework, SELF-JUDGE, that (1) does on-policy learning and (2) is parameter efficient, as it does not require an additional RM for evaluating the samples for on-policy learning. To this end, we propose Judge-augmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (JSFT) to train a single model to act as both a policy and a judge. Specifically, we view the pairwise judgment task, choosing the better response from a response pair, as a special case of the instruction-following task. The resulting model can judge preferences of on-the-fly responses from current policy initialized from itself. Experimental results show the efficacy of SELF-JUDGE, outperforming baselines in preference benchmarks. We also show that the rejecting sampling by itself can improve performance further without an additional evaluator.",
    "Aligning Large Language Models for Controllable Recommendations": "Inspired by the exceptional general intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to explore their application in pioneering the next generation of recommender systems — systems that are conversational, explainable, and controllable. However, existing literature primarily concentrates on integrating domain-specific knowledge into LLMs to enhance accuracy using a fixed task template, often overlooking the diversity of recommendation tasks and the ability of LLMs to follow recommendation-specific instructions. To address this gap, we first introduce a collection of supervised learning tasks, augmented with labels derived from a conventional recommender model, aimed at explicitly improving LLMs' proficiency in adhering to recommendation-specific instructions. Next, we propose a reinforcement learning-based alignment procedure to enhance LLMs' generalization ability. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the capability of LLMs to respond to instructions within recommender systems, reducing formatting errors while maintaining a high level of accuracy.",
    "Aligning Large Language Models via Fine-grained Supervision": "Pre-trained large-scale language models (LLMs) excel at producing coherent articles, yet their outputs may be untruthful, toxic, or fail to align with user expectations. Current approaches focus on using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to improve model alignment, which works by transforming coarse human preferences of LLM outputs into a feedback signal that guides the model learning process. However, because this approach operates on sequence-level feedback, it lacks the precision to identify the exact parts of the output affecting user preferences. To address this gap, we propose a method to enhance LLM alignment through fine-grained token-level supervision. Specifically, we ask annotators to minimally edit less preferred responses within the standard reward modeling dataset to make them more favorable, ensuring changes are made only where necessary while retaining most of the original content. The refined dataset is used to train a token-level reward model, which is then used for training our fine-grained Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model. Our experiment results demonstrate that this approach can achieve up to an absolute improvement of 5.1% in LLM performance, in terms of win rate against the reference model, compared with the traditional PPO model.",
    "Aligning Large Language Models with Human Preferences through Representation Engineering": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for enhancing their utility in terms of helpfulness, truthfulness, safety, harmlessness, and interestingness. Existing methods for achieving this alignment often involve employing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune LLMs based on human labels assessing the relative quality of model responses. Nevertheless, RLHF is susceptible to instability during fine-tuning and presents challenges in implementation. Drawing inspiration from the emerging field of representation engineering (RepE), this study aims to identify relevant representations for high-level human preferences embedded in patterns of activity within an LLM and achieve precise control of model behavior by transforming its representations. This novel approach, denoted as Representation Alignment from Human Feedback (RAHF), proves to be effective, computationally efficient, and easy to implement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of RAHF in not only capturing but also manipulating representations to align with a broad spectrum of human preferences or values, rather than being confined to a singular concept or function (e.g., honesty or bias). RAHF's versatility in accommodating diverse human preferences shows its potential for advancing LLM performance.",
    "Aligning Large Multimodal Models with Factually Augmented RLHF": "Large Multimodal Models (LMM) are built across modalities and the misalignment between two modalities can result in “hallucination”, generating textual outputs that are not grounded by the multimodal information in context. To address the multimodal misalignment issue, we adapt the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) from the text domain to the task of vision-language alignment, where human annotators are asked to compare two responses and pinpoint the more hallucinated one, and the vision-language model is trained to maximize the simulated human rewards. We propose a new alignment algorithm called Factually Augmented RLHF that augments the reward model with additional factual information such as image captions and ground-truth multi-choice options, which alleviates the reward hacking phenomenon in RLHF and further improves the performance. We also enhance the GPT-4-generated training data (for vision instruction tuning) with previously available human-written image-text pairs to improve the general capabilities of our model. To evaluate the proposed approach in real-world scenarios, we develop a new evaluation benchmark MMHAL-BENCH with a special focus on penalizing hallucinations. As the first LMM trained with RLHF, our approach achieves remarkable improvement on the LLaVA-Bench dataset with the 96% performance level of the text-only GPT-4 (while previous best methods can only achieve the 87% level), and an improvement by 60% on MMHAL-BENCH over other baselines. We opensource our code, model, data at https://llava-rlhf.github.io.",
    "Aligning to Adults Is Easy, Aligning to Children Is Hard: A Study of Linguistic Alignment in Dialogue Systems": "During conversations, people align to one another over time, by using similar words, concepts, and syntax. This helps form a shared understanding of the conversational content and is associated with increased engagement and satisfaction. It also affects conversation outcomes: e.g., when talking to language learners, an above normal level of linguistic alignment of parents or language teachers is correlated with faster language acquisition. These benefits make human-like alignment an important property of dialogue systems, which has often been overlooked by the NLP community. In order to fill this gap, we ask: (RQ1) Due to the importance for engagement and satisfaction, to what degree do state-of-the-art dialogue systems align to adult users? (RQ2) With a potential application to child language acquisition in mind, do systems, similar to parents, show high levels of alignment during conversations with children? Our experiments show that ChatGPT aligns to adults at roughly human levels, while Llama2 shows elevated alignment. However, when responding to a child, both systems' alignment is below human levels.",
    "Aligning Unstructured Paris Agreement Climate Plans with Sustainable Development Goals": "Aligning unstructured climate policy documents according to a particular classification taxonomy with little to no labeled examples is challenging and requires manual effort of climate policy researchers. In this work we examine whether large language models (LLMs) can act as an effective substitute or assist in the annotation process. Utilizing a large set of text spans from Paris Agreement Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) linked to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets contained in the Climate Watch dataset from the World Resources Institute in combination with our own annotated data, we validate our approaches and establish a benchmark for model performance evaluation on this task. With our evaluation benchmarking we quantify the effectiveness of using zero-shot or few-shot prompted LLMs to align these documents.",
    "Alirector: Alignment-Enhanced Chinese Grammatical Error Corrector": "Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) faces serious overcorrection challenges when employing autoregressive generative models such as sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models and decoder-only large language models (LLMs). While previous methods aim to address overcorrection in Seq2Seq models, they are difficult to adapt to decoder-only LLMs. In this paper, we propose an alignment-enhanced corrector for the overcorrection problem that applies to both Seq2Seq models and decoder-only LLMs. Our method first trains a correction model to generate an initial correction of the source sentence. Then, we combine the source sentence with the initial correction and feed it through an alignment model for another round of correction, aiming to enforce the alignment model to focus on potential overcorrection. Moreover, to enhance the model's ability to identify nuances, we further explore the reverse alignment of the source sentence and the initial correction. Finally, we transfer the alignment knowledge from two alignment models to the correction model, instructing it on how to avoid overcorrection. Experimental results on three CGEC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in alleviating overcorrection and improving overall performance. Our code has been made publicly available.",
    "All Languages Matter: On the Multilingual Safety of LLMs": "Ensuring safety is fundamental when developing and deploying large language models (LLMs). However, previous safety benchmarks only concern the safety in one language, e.g., the majority language in the pretraining data, such as English. In this work, we build the first multilingual safety benchmark for LLMs, XSAFETY, in response to the global deployment of LLMs in practice. XSAFETY covers 14 commonly used safety issues across ten languages spanning several language families. We utilize XSAFETY to empirically study the multilingual safety for four widely-used LLMs, including closed-source APIs and open-source models. Experimental results show that all LLMs produce significantly more unsafe responses for non-English queries than English ones, indicating the necessity of developing safety alignment for non-English languages. In addition, we propose a simple and effective prompting method to improve ChatGPT's multilingual safety by enhancing cross-lingual generalization of safety alignment. Our prompting method can significantly reduce the ratio of unsafe responses by 42% for non-English queries. We release the data to facilitate future research on LLM's safety.",
    "ALMol: Aligned Language-Molecule Translation LLMs through Offline Preference Contrastive Optimisation": "The field of chemistry and Artificial Intelligence (AI) intersection is an area of active research that aims to accelerate scientific discovery. The integration of large language models (LLMs) with scientific modalities has shown significant promise in this endeavour. However, challenges persist in effectively addressing training efficacy and the out-of-distribution problem, particularly as existing approaches rely on larger models and datasets. In this context, we focus on machine language-molecule translation and deploy a novel training approach called contrastive preference optimisation, which avoids generating translations that are merely adequate but not perfect. To ensure generalisability and mitigate memorisation effects, we conduct experiments using only 10% of the data. Our results demonstrate that our models achieve up to a 32% improvement compared to counterpart models. Finally, we introduce a fine-grained, domain-agnostic evaluation method to assess hallucination in LLMs and promote responsible use.",
    "Alson at NADI 2024 Shared Task: Alson - A Fine-Tuned Model for Arabic Dialect Translation": "DA-MSA Machine Translation is a recent challenge due to the multitude of Arabic dialects and their variations. In this paper, we present our results within the context of Subtask 3 of the NADI-2024 Shared Task (Abdul-Mageed et al., 2024) that is DA-MSA Machine Translation. We utilized the DIALECTS-MSA MADAR corpus (Bouamor et al., 2018), the Emi-NADI corpus for the Emirati dialect (Khered et al., 2023), and we augmented the Palestinian and Jordanian datasets based on NADI 2021. Our approach involves developing sentence-level machine translations from Palestinian, Jordanian, Emirati, and Egyptian dialects to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). To address this challenge, we fine-tuned models such as (Nagoudi et al., 2022) AraT5v2-msa-small, AraT5v2-msa-base, and (Elmadany et al., 2023) AraT5v2-base-1024 to compare their performance. Among these, the AraT5v2-base-1024 model achieved the best accuracy, with a BLEU score of 0.1650 on the development set and 0.1746 on the test set.",
    "An Easy-to-use Instruction Processing Framework for Large Language Models": "In recent years, instruction tuning has gained increasing attention and emerged as a crucial technique to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To construct high-quality instruction datasets, many instruction processing approaches have been proposed, aiming to achieve a delicate balance between data quantity and data quality. Nevertheless, due to inconsistencies that persist among various instruction processing methods, there is no standard open-source instruction processing implementation framework available for the community, which hinders practitioners from further developing and advancing. To facilitate instruction processing research and development, we present EasyInstruct, an easy-to-use instruction processing framework for LLMs, which modularizes instruction generation, selection, and prompting, while also considering their combination and interaction. EasyInstruct is publicly released and actively maintained at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyInstruct, along with an online demo app and a demo video for quick-start, calling for broader research centered on instruction data and synthetic data.",
    "An Empirical Analysis on Large Language Models in Debate Evaluation": "In this study, we investigate the capabilities and inherent biases of advanced large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in the context of debate evaluation. We discover that LLM's performance exceeds humans and surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods fine-tuned on extensive datasets in debate evaluation. We additionally explore and analyze biases present in LLMs, including positional bias, lexical bias, order bias, which may affect their evaluative judgments. Our findings reveal a consistent bias in both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 towards the second candidate response presented, attributed to prompt design. We also uncover lexical biases in both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, especially when label sets carry connotations such as numerical or sequential, highlighting the critical need for careful label verbalizer selection in prompt design. Additionally, our analysis indicates a tendency of both models to favor the debate's concluding side as the winner, suggesting an end-of-discussion bias.",
    "An Empirical Study of Gendered Stereotypes in Emotional Attributes for Bangla in Multilingual Large Language Models": "The influence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly growing, automating more jobs over time. Assessing the fairness of LLMs is crucial due to their expanding impact. Studies reveal the reflection of societal norms and biases in LLMs, which creates a risk of propagating societal stereotypes in downstream tasks. Many studies on bias in LLMs focus on gender bias in various NLP applications. However, there's a gap in research on bias in emotional attributes, despite the close societal link between emotion and gender. This gap is even larger for low-resource languages like Bangla. Historically, women are associated with emotions like empathy, fear, and guilt, while men are linked to anger, bravado, and authority. This pattern reflects societal norms in Bangla-speaking regions. We offer the first thorough investigation of gendered emotion attribution in Bangla for both closed and open source LLMs in this work. Our aim is to elucidate the intricate societal relationship between gender and emotion specifically within the context of Bangla. We have been successful in showing the existence of gender bias in the context of emotions in Bangla through analytical methods and also show how emotion attribution changes on the basis of gendered role selection in LLMs. All of our resources including code and data are made publicly available to support future research on Bangla NLP.",
    "An Empirical Study of In-context Learning in LLMs for Machine Translation": "Recent interest has surged in employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for machine translation (MT) via in-context learning (ICL) (Vilar et al., 2023). Most prior studies primarily focus on optimizing translation quality, with limited attention to understanding the specific aspects of ICL that influence the said quality. To this end, we perform the first of its kind, an exhaustive study of in-context learning for machine translation. We first establish that ICL is primarily example-driven and not instruction-driven. Following this, we conduct an extensive exploration of various aspects of the examples to understand their influence on downstream performance. Our analysis includes factors such as quality and quantity of demonstrations, spatial proximity, and source versus target originality. Further, we also investigate challenging scenarios involving indirectness and misalignment of examples to understand the limits of ICL. While we establish the significance of the quality of the target distribution over the source distribution of demonstrations, we further observe that perturbations sometimes act as regularizers, resulting in performance improvements. Surprisingly, ICL does not necessitate examples from the same task, and a related task with the same target distribution proves sufficient. We hope that our study acts as a guiding resource for considerations in utilizing ICL for MT. Our code is available on https://github.com/PranjalChitale/in-context-mt-analysis.",
    "An Empirical Study on Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for MultiModal Large Language Models": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with multimodal instruction datasets have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in multimodal tasks. However, fine-tuning all parameters of MLLMs has become challenging as they usually contain billions of parameters. To address this issue, we study parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for MLLMs. We aim to identify effective methods for enhancing the performance of MLLMs in scenarios where only a limited number of parameters are trained. This paper conducts empirical studies using four popular PEFT methods to fine-tune the LLM component of open-source MLLMs. We present a comprehensive analysis that encompasses various aspects, including the impact of PEFT methods on various models, parameters and location of the PEFT module, size of fine-tuning data, model stability based on PEFT methods, MLLM's generalization, and hallucination. We evaluated four PEFT methods on seven datasets from two different categories: unseen and seen datasets. Across all experiments, we show that the adapter is the best-performing PEFT method. At the same time, fine-tuning the connector layers leads to improved performance in most MLLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/alenai97/PEFT-MLLM.git",
    "An Entropy-based Text Watermarking Detection Method": "Text watermarking algorithms for large language models (LLMs) can effectively identify machine-generated texts by embedding and detecting hidden features in the text. Although the current text watermarking algorithms perform well in most high-entropy scenarios, its performance in low-entropy scenarios still needs to be improved. In this work, we opine that the influence of token entropy should be fully considered in the watermark detection process, i.e., the weight of each token during watermark detection should be customized according to its entropy, rather than setting the weights of all tokens to the same value as in previous methods. Specifically, we propose Entropy-based Text Watermarking Detection (EWD) that gives higher-entropy tokens higher influence weights during watermark detection, so as to better reflect the degree of watermarking. Furthermore, the proposed detection process is training-free and fully automated. From the experiments, we demonstrate that our EWD can achieve better detection performance in low-entropy scenarios, and our method is also general and can be applied to texts with different entropy distributions. Our code and data is available1. Additionally, our algorithm could be accessed through MarkLLM (Pan et al., 2024)2.",
    "An Experimental Design Framework for Label-Efficient Supervised Finetuning of Large Language Models": "Supervised finetuning (SFT) on instruction datasets has played a crucial role in achieving the remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities observed in modern large language models (LLMs). However, the annotation efforts required to produce high quality responses for instructions are becoming prohibitively expensive, especially as the number of tasks spanned by instruction datasets continues to increase. Active learning is effective in identifying useful subsets of samples to annotate from an unlabeled pool, but its high computational cost remains a barrier to its widespread applicability in the context of LLMs. To mitigate the annotation cost of SFT and circumvent the computational bottlenecks of active learning, we propose using experimental design. Experimental design techniques select the most informative samples to label, and typically maximize some notion of uncertainty and/or diversity. In our work, we implement a framework that evaluates several existing and novel experimental design techniques and find that these methods consistently yield significant gains in label efficiency with little computational overhead. On generative tasks, to reach the same generalization performance, our methods save 50% of the annotation cost compared to random sampling.",
    "An Expert is Worth One Token: Synergizing Multiple Expert LLMs as Generalist via Expert Token Routing": "We present Expert-Token-Routing, a unified generalist framework that facilitates seamless integration of multiple expert LLMs. Our framework represents expert LLMs as special expert tokens within the vocabulary of a meta LLM. The meta LLM can route to an expert LLM like generating new tokens. Expert-Token-Routing not only supports learning the implicit expertise of expert LLMs from existing instruction dataset but also allows for dynamic extension of new expert LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. It also conceals the detailed collaboration process from the user's perspective, facilitating interaction as though it were a singular LLM. Our framework outperforms various existing multi-LLM collaboration paradigms across benchmarks that incorporate six diverse expert domains, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness in building generalist LLM system via synergizing multiple expert LLMs.",
    "An Information Bottleneck Perspective for Effective Noise Filtering on Retrieval-Augmented Generation": "Retrieval-augmented generation integrates the capabilities of large language models with relevant information retrieved from an extensive corpus, yet encounters challenges when confronted with real-world noisy data. One recent solution is to train a filter module to find relevant content but only achieve suboptimal noise compression. In this paper, we propose to introduce the information bottleneck theory into retrieval-augmented generation. Our approach involves the filtration of noise by simultaneously maximizing the mutual information between compression and ground output, while minimizing the mutual information between compression and retrieved passage. In addition, we derive the formula of information bottleneck to facilitate its application in novel comprehensive evaluations, the selection of supervised fine-tuning data, and the construction of reinforcement learning rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements across various question answering datasets, not only in terms of the correctness of answer generation but also in the conciseness with 2.5% compression rate.",
    "An Interactive Toolkit for Approachable NLP": "We present a novel tool designed for teaching and interfacing the information-theoretic modeling abilities of large language models. The Surprisal Toolkit allows students from diverse linguistic and programming backgrounds to learn about measures of information theory and natural language processing (NLP) through an online interactive tool. In addition, the interface provides a valuable research mechanism for obtaining measures of surprisal. We implement the toolkit as part of a classroom tutorial in three different learning scenarios and discuss the overall receptive student feedback. We suggest this toolkit and similar applications as resourceful supplements to instruction in NLP topics, especially for the purpose of balancing conceptual understanding with technical instruction, grounding abstract topics, and engaging students with varying coding abilities.",
    "An Investigation of Neuron Activation as a Unified Lens to Explain Chain-of-Thought Eliciting Arithmetic Reasoning of LLMs": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong arithmetic reasoning capabilities when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. However, we have only a limited understanding of how they are processed by LLMs. To demystify it, prior work has primarily focused on ablating different components in the CoT prompt and empirically observing their resulting LLM performance change (Madaan and Yazdanbakhsh, 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Ye et al., 2023). Yet, the reason why these components are important to LLM reasoning is not explored. To fill this gap, in this work, we investigate “neuron activation” as a lens to provide a unified explanation to observations made by prior work. Specifically, we look into neurons within the feed-forward layers of LLMs that may have activated their arithmetic reasoning capabilities, using Llama2 (Touvron et al., 2023) as an example. To facilitate this investigation, we also propose an approach based on GPT-4 to automatically identify neurons that imply arithmetic reasoning. Our analyses revealed that the activation of reasoning neurons in the feed-forward layers of an LLM can explain the importance of various components in a CoT prompt, and future research can extend it for a more complete understanding.",
    "An LLM-based Knowledge Synthesis and Scientific Reasoning Framework for Biomedical Discovery": "We present BioLunar, developed using the Lunar framework, as a tool for supporting biological analyses, with a particular emphasis on molecular-level evidence enrichment for biomarker discovery in oncology. The platform integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate complex scientific reasoning across distributed evidence spaces, enhancing the capability for harmonizing and reasoning over heterogeneous data sources. Demonstrating its utility in cancer research, BioLunar leverages modular design, reusable data access and data analysis components, and a low-code user interface, enabling researchers of all programming levels to construct LLM-enabled scientific workflows. By facilitating automatic scientific discovery and inference from heterogeneous evidence, BioLunar exemplifies the potential of the integration between LLMs, specialised databases and biomedical tools to support expert-level knowledge synthesis and discovery.",
    "ANAH: Analytical Annotation of Hallucinations in Large Language Models": "Reducing the 'hallucination' problem of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for their wide applications. A comprehensive and fine-grained measurement of the hallucination is the first key step for the governance of this issue but is under-explored in the community. Thus, we present ANAH, a bilingual dataset that offers ANalytical Annotation of Hallucinations in LLMs within Generative Question Answering. Each answer sentence in our dataset undergoes rigorous annotation, involving the retrieval of a reference fragment, the judgment of the hallucination type, and the correction of hallucinated content. ANAH consists of ∼12k sentence-level annotations for ∼4.3k LLM responses covering over 700 topics, constructed by a human-in-the-loop pipeline. Thanks to the fine granularity of the hallucination annotations, we can quantitatively confirm that the hallucinations of LLMs progressively accumulate in the answer and use ANAH to train and evaluate hallucination annotators. We conduct extensive experiments on studying generative and discriminative annotators and show that, although current open-source LLMs have difficulties in fine-grained hallucination annotation, the generative annotator trained with ANAH can surpass all open-source LLMs and GPT-3.5, obtain performance competitive with GPT-4, and exhibits better generalization ability on unseen questions.",
    "ANALOGYKB: Unlocking Analogical Reasoning of Language Models with A Million-scale Knowledge Base": "Analogical reasoning is a fundamental cognitive ability of humans. However, current language models (LMs) still struggle to achieve human-like performance in analogical reasoning tasks due to a lack of resources for model training. In this work, we address this gap by proposing ANALOGYKB, a million-scale analogy knowledge base (KB) derived from existing knowledge graphs (KGs). ANALOGYKB identifies two types of analogies from the KGs: 1) analogies of the same relations, which can be directly extracted from the KGs, and 2) analogies of analogous relations, which are identified with a selection and filtering pipeline enabled by large language models (LLMs), followed by minor human efforts for data quality control. Evaluations on a series of datasets of two analogical reasoning tasks (analogy recognition and generation) demonstrate that ANALOGYKB successfully enables both smaller LMs and LLMs to gain better analogical reasoning capabilities. Resources of this paper can be found at https://github.com/siyuyuan/analogykb.",
    "Analysing The Impact of Sequence Composition on Language Model Pre-Training": "Most language model pre-training frameworks concatenate multiple documents into fixed-length sequences and use causal masking to compute the likelihood of each token given its context; this strategy is widely adopted due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, to this day, the influence of the pre-training sequence composition strategy on the generalisation properties of the model remains under-explored. In this work, we find that applying causal masking can lead to the inclusion of distracting information from previous documents during pre-training, which negatively impacts the performance of the models on language modelling and downstream tasks. In intra-document causal masking, the likelihood of each token is only conditioned on the previous tokens in the same document, eliminating potential distracting information from previous documents and significantly improving performance. Furthermore, we find that concatenating related documents can reduce some potential distractions during pre-training, and our proposed efficient retrieval-based sequence construction method, BM25Chunk, can improve in-context learning (+11.6%), knowledge memorisation (+9.8%), and context utilisation (+7.2%) abilities of language models without sacrificing efficiency.",
    "Analysing zero-shot temporal relation extraction on clinical notes using temporal consistency": "This paper presents the first study for temporal relation extraction in a zero-shot setting focusing on biomedical text. We employ two types of prompts and five Large Language Models (LLMs; GPT-3.5, Mixtral, Llama 2, Gemma, and PMC-LLaMA) to obtain responses about the temporal relations between two events. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle in the zero-shot setting, performing worse than fine-tuned specialized models in terms of F1 score. This highlights the challenging nature of this task and underscores the need for further research to enhance the performance of LLMs in this context. We further contribute a novel comprehensive temporal analysis by calculating consistency scores for each LLM. Our findings reveal that LLMs face challenges in providing responses consistent with the temporal properties of uniqueness and transitivity. Moreover, we study the relation between the temporal consistency of an LLM and its accuracy, and whether the latter can be improved by solving temporal inconsistencies. Our analysis shows that even when temporal consistency is achieved, the predictions can remain inaccurate.",
    "Analysis of LLM's “Spurious” Correct Answers Using Evidence Information of Multi-hop QA Datasets": "Recent LLMs show an impressive accuracy on one of the hallmark tasks of language understanding, namely Question Answering (QA). However, it is not clear if the correct answers provided by LLMs are actually grounded on the correct knowledge related to the question. In this paper, we use multi-hop QA datasets to evaluate the accuracy of the knowledge LLMs use to answer questions, and show that as much as 31% of the correct answers by the LLMs are in fact spurious, i.e., the knowledge LLMs used to ground the answer is wrong while the answer is correct. We present an analysis of these spurious correct answers by GPT-4 using three datasets in two languages, while suggesting future pathways to correct the grounding information using existing external knowledge bases.",
    "Analyze, Generate and Refine: Query Expansion with LLMs for Zero-Shot Open-Domain QA": "Query expansion (QE) is a critical component in the open-domain question answering (OpenQA) pipeline, enhancing the retrieval performance by broadening the scope of queries with additional relevant texts. However, existing methods like GAR and EAR rely heavily on supervised training and often struggle to maintain effectiveness across domains and datasets. Meanwhile, although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated QE capability for information retrieval (IR) tasks, their application in OpenQA is hindered by the inadequate analysis of query's informational needs and the lack of quality control for generated QEs, failing to meet the unique requirements of OpenQA. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel LLM-based QE approach named AGR for the OpenQA task, leveraging a three-step prompting strategy. AGR begins with an analysis of the query, followed by the generation of answer-oriented expansions, and culminates with a refinement process for better query formulation. Extensive experiments on four OpenQA datasets reveal that AGR not only rivals in-domain supervised methods in retrieval accuracy, but also outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in out-of-domain zero-shot scenarios. Moreover, it exhibits enhanced performance in end-to-end QA evaluations, underscoring the superiority of AGR for OpenQA.",
    "Analyzing LLM Behavior in Dialogue Summarization: Unveiling Circumstantial Hallucination Trends": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have considerably advanced the capabilities of summarization systems. However, they continue to face concerns about hallucination. While prior work has evaluated LLMs extensively in news domains, most evaluation of dialogue summarization has focused on BART-based models, leaving a gap in our understanding of their faithfulness. Our work benchmarks the faithfulness of LLMs for dialogue summarization, using human annotations and focusing on identifying and categorizing span-level inconsistencies. Specifically, we focus on two prominent LLMs: GPT-4 and Alpaca-13B. Our evaluation reveals subtleties as to what constitutes a hallucination: LLMs often generate plausible inferences, supported by circumstantial evidence in the conversation, that lack direct evidence, a pattern that is less prevalent in older models. We propose a refined taxonomy of errors, coining the category of Circumstantial Inference to bucket these LLM behaviors. Using our taxonomy, we compare the behavioral differences between LLMs and older fine-tuned models. Additionally, we systematically assess the efficacy of automatic error detection methods on LLM summaries and find that they struggle to detect these nuanced errors. To address this, we introduce two prompt-based approaches for fine-grained error detection that outperform existing metrics, particularly for identifying Circumstantial Inference.",
    "Analyzing Semantic Change through Lexical Replacements": "Modern language models are capable of contextualizing words based on their surrounding context. However, this capability is often compromised due to semantic change that leads to words being used in new, unexpected contexts not encountered during pre-training. In this paper, we model semantic change by studying the effect of unexpected contexts introduced by lexical replacements. We propose a replacement schema where a target word is substituted with lexical replacements of varying relatedness, thus simulating different kinds of semantic change. Furthermore, we leverage the replacement schema as a basis for a novel interpretable model for semantic change. We are also the first to evaluate the use of LLaMa for semantic change detection.",
    "Analyzing Temporal Complex Events with Large Language Models": "The digital landscape is rapidly evolving with an ever-increasing volume of online news, emphasizing the need for swift and precise analysis of complex events. We refer to the complex events composed of many news articles over an extended period as Temporal Complex Event (TCE). This paper proposes a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically extract and analyze the event chain within TCE, characterized by their key points and timestamps. We establish a benchmark, named TCELongBench, to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in handling temporal dynamics and understanding extensive text. This benchmark encompasses three distinct tasks - reading comprehension, temporal sequencing, and future event forecasting. In the experiment, we leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method and LLMs with long context window to deal with lengthy news articles of TCE. Our findings indicate that models with suitable retrievers exhibit comparable performance with those utilizing long context window.",
    "Anchor-based Large Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) predominantly employ decoder-only transformer architectures, necessitating the retention of keys/values information for historical tokens to provide contextual information and avoid redundant computation. However, the substantial size and parameter volume of these LLMs require massive GPU memory. This memory demand increases with the length of the input text, leading to an urgent need for more efficient methods of information storage and processing. This study introduces Anchor-based LLMs (AnLLMs), which utilize an innovative anchor-based self-attention network (AnSAN) and also an anchor-based inference strategy. This approach enables LLMs to compress sequence information into an anchor token, reducing the keys/values cache and enhancing inference efficiency. Experiments on question-answering benchmarks reveal that AnLLMs maintain similar accuracy levels while achieving up to 99% keys/values cache reduction and up to 3.5 times faster inference. Despite a minor compromise in accuracy, the substantial enhancements of AnLLMs employing the AnSAN technique in resource utilization and computational efficiency underscore their potential for practical LLM applications.",
    "Ancient Wisdom, Modern Tools: Exploring Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Ancient Indian Philosophy": "LLMs have revolutionized the landscape of information retrieval and knowledge dissemination. However, their application in specialized areas is often hindered by limitations such as factual inaccuracies and hallucinations, especially in long-tail knowledge distributions. In this work, we explore the potential of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models in performing long-form question answering (LFQA) on a specially curated niche and custom knowledge domain. We present VedantaNY-10M, a dataset curated from extensive public discourses on the ancient Indian philosophy of Advaita Vedanta. We develop and benchmark a RAG model against a standard, non-RAG LLM, focusing on transcription, retrieval, and generation performance. A human evaluation involving computational linguists and domain experts shows that the RAG model significantly outperforms the standard model in producing factual, comprehensive responses having fewer hallucinations. In addition, we find that a keyword-based hybrid retriever that focuses on unique low-frequency words further improves results. Our study provides insights into meaningfully integrating modern large language models with ancient knowledge systems.",
    "Angry Men, Sad Women: Large Language Models Reflect Gendered Stereotypes in Emotion Attribution": "Large language models (LLMs) reflect societal norms and biases, especially about gender. While societal biases and stereotypes have been extensively researched in various NLP applications, there is a surprising gap for emotion analysis. However, emotion and gender are closely linked in societal discourse. E.g., women are often thought of as more empathetic, while men's anger is more socially accepted. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study of gendered emotion attribution in five state-of-the-art LLMs (open- and closed-source). We investigate whether emotions are gendered, and whether these variations are based on societal stereotypes. We prompt the models to adopt a gendered persona and attribute emotions to an event like 'When I had a serious argument with a dear person'. We then analyze the emotions generated by the models in relation to the gender-event pairs. We find that all models consistently exhibit gendered emotions, influenced by gender stereotypes. These findings are in line with established research in psychology and gender studies. Our study sheds light on the complex societal interplay between language, gender, and emotion. The reproduction of emotion stereotypes in LLMs allows us to use those models to study the topic in detail, but raises questions about the predictive use of those same LLMs for emotion applications.",
    "Annotating FrameNet via Structure-Conditioned Language Generation": "Despite the remarkable generative capabilities of language models in producing naturalistic language, their effectiveness on explicit manipulation and generation of linguistic structures remain understudied. In this paper, we investigate the task of generating new sentences preserving a given semantic structure, following the FrameNet formalism. We propose a framework to produce novel frame-semantically annotated sentences following an overgenerate-and-filter approach. Our results show that conditioning on rich, explicit semantic information tends to produce generations with high human acceptance, under both prompting and finetuning. Our generated frame-semantic structured annotations are effective at training data augmentation for frame-semantic role labeling in low-resource settings; however, we do not see benefits under higher resource settings. Our study concludes that while generating high-quality, semantically rich data might be within reach, the downstream utility of such generations remains to be seen, highlighting the outstanding challenges with automating linguistic annotation tasks.",
    "Answer is All You Need: Instruction-following Text Embedding via Answering the Question": "This work aims to build a text embedder that can capture characteristics of texts specified by user instructions. Despite its tremendous potential to deploy user-oriented embeddings, none of previous approaches provides a concrete solution for it. This paper offers a new viewpoint, which treats the instruction as a question about the input text and encodes the expected answers to obtain the representation accordingly. Intuitively, texts with the same (implicit) semantics would share similar answers following the instruction, thus leading to more similar embeddings. Specifically, we propose INBEDDER that instantiates this embed-via-answering idea by only fine-tuning language models on abstractive question answering tasks. INBEDDER demonstrates significantly improved instruction-following capabilities according to our proposed instruction awareness tests and instruction robustness tests, when applied to both large language models (LLMs) (e.g., llama-2-7b) and smaller encoder-based LMs (e.g., roberta-large). Additionally, our qualitative analysis of clustering outcomes, achieved by applying different instructions to the same corpus, demonstrates a high degree of interpretability.",
    "AnyGPT: Unified Multimodal LLM with Discrete Sequence Modeling": "We introduce AnyGPT, an any-to-any multi-modal language model that utilizes discrete representations for the unified processing of various modalities, including speech, text, images, and music. AnyGPT can be trained stably without any alterations to the current large language model (LLM) architecture or training paradigms. Instead, it relies exclusively on data-level preprocessing, facilitating the seamless integration of new modalities into LLMs, akin to the incorporation of new languages. We build a multimodal text-centric dataset for multimodal alignment pre-training. Utilizing generative models, we synthesize the first large-scale any-to-any multimodal instruction dataset. It consists of 108k samples of multi-turn conversations that intricately interweave various modalities, thus equipping the model to handle arbitrary combinations of multimodal inputs and outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that AnyGPT is capable of facilitating any-to-any multimodal conversation while achieving performance comparable to specialized models across all modalities, proving that discrete representations can effectively and conveniently unify multiple modalities within a language model.",
    "API-BLEND: A Comprehensive Corpora for Training and Benchmarking API LLMs": "There is a growing need for Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively use tools and external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to plan and complete tasks. As such, there is tremendous interest in methods that can acquire sufficient quantities of train and test data that involve calls to tools / APIs. Two lines of research have emerged as the predominant strategies for addressing this challenge. The first has focused on synthetic data generation techniques, while the second has involved curating task-adjacent datasets which can be transformed into API / Tool-based tasks. In this paper, we focus on the task of identifying, curating, and transforming existing datasets and, in turn, introduce API-BLEND, a large corpora for training and systematic testing of tool-augmented LLMs. The datasets mimic real-world scenarios involving API-tasks such as API / tool detection, slot filling, and sequencing of the detected APIs. We demonstrate the utility of the API-BLEND dataset for both training and benchmarking purposes.",
    "Application of Generative AI as an Enterprise Wikibase Knowledge Graph Q&A System": "Generative AI and Large Language Models are increasingly used in business contexts. One application involves natural language conversations contextualized by company data, which can be accomplished by Enterprise Knowledge Graphs, standardized representations of data. This paper outlines an architecture for implementation of an Enterprise Knowledge Graph using open-source Wikibase software. Additionally, it is presented a Knowledge Graph Q&A System powered by Generative AI.",
    "Applying RLAIF for Code Generation with API-usage in Lightweight LLMs": "Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) has demonstrated significant potential across various domains, including mitigating harm in LLM outputs, enhancing text summarization, and mathematical reasoning. This paper introduces an RLAIF framework for improving the code generation abilities of lightweight (<1B parameters) LLMs. We specifically focus on code generation tasks that require writing appropriate API calls, which is challenging due to the well-known issue of hallucination in LLMs. Our framework extracts AI feedback from a larger LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5) through a specialized prompting strategy and uses this data to train a reward model towards better alignment from smaller LLMs. We run our experiments on the Gorilla dataset and meticulously assess the quality of the model-generated code across various metrics, including AST, ROUGE, and Code-BLEU, and develop a pipeline to compute its executability rate accurately. Our approach significantly enhances the fine-tuned LLM baseline's performance, achieving a 4.5% improvement in executability rate. Notably, a smaller LLM model (780M parameters) trained with RLAIF surpasses a much larger fine-tuned baseline with 7B parameters, achieving a 1.0% higher code executability rate.",
    "AppWorld: A Controllable World of Apps and People for Benchmarking Interactive Coding Agents": "Autonomous agents that address day-to-day digital tasks (e.g., ordering groceries for a household), must not only operate multiple apps (e.g., notes, messaging, shopping app) via APIs, but also generate rich code with complex control flow in an iterative manner based on their interaction with the environment. However, existing benchmarks for tool use are inadequate, as they only cover tasks that require a simple sequence of API calls. To remedy this gap, we built AppWorld Engine,1 a high-quality execution environment (60K lines of code) of 9 day-to-day apps operable via 457 APIs and populated with realistic digital activities simulating the lives of ~100 fictitious users. We then created AppWorld Benchmark (40K lines of code), a suite of 750 natural, diverse, and challenging autonomous agent tasks requiring rich and interactive code generation. It supports robust programmatic evaluation with state-based unit tests, allowing for different ways of completing a task while also checking for unexpected changes, i.e., collateral damage.  The state-of-the-art LLM, GPT4O, solves only ~49% of our 'normal' tasks and ~30% of 'challenge' tasks, while other models solve at least 16% fewer. This highlights the benchmark's difficulty and AppWorld's potential to push the frontiers of interactive coding agents.",
    "Arabic Automatic Story Generation with Large Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for a wide range of language generation tasks. Nevertheless, this progress has been slower in Arabic. In this work, we focus on the task of generating stories from LLMs. For our training, we use stories acquired through machine translation (MT) as well as GPT-4. For the MT data, we develop a careful pipeline that ensures we acquire high-quality stories. For our GPT-4 data, we introduce crafted prompts that allow us to generate data well-suited to the Arabic context in both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and two Arabic dialects (Egyptian and Moroccan). For example, we generate stories tailored to various Arab countries on a wide host of topics. Our manual evaluation shows that our model fine-tuned on these training datasets can generate coherent stories that adhere to our instructions. We also conduct an extensive automatic and human evaluation comparing our models against state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models. Our datasets and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/UBC-NLP/arastories.",
    "Arabic Diacritics in the Wild: Exploiting Opportunities for Improved Diacritization": "The widespread absence of diacritical marks in Arabic text poses a significant challenge for Arabic natural language processing (NLP). This paper explores instances of naturally occurring diacritics, referred to as “diacritics in the wild,” to unveil patterns and latent information across six diverse genres: news articles, novels, children's books, poetry, political documents, and ChatGPT outputs. We present a new annotated dataset that maps real-world partially diacritized words to their maximal full diacritization in context. Additionally, we propose extensions to the analyze-and-disambiguate approach in Arabic NLP to leverage these diacritics, resulting in notable improvements. Our contributions encompass a thorough analysis, valuable datasets, and an extended diacritization algorithm. We release our code and datasets as open source.",
    "Arabic Train at NADI 2024 shared task: LLMs' Ability to Translate Arabic Dialects into Modern Standard Arabic": "Navigating the intricacies of machine translation (MT) involves tackling the nuanced disparities between Arabic dialects and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), presenting a formidable obstacle. In this study, we delve into Subtask 3 of the NADI shared task (Abdul-Mageed et al., 2024), focusing on the translation of sentences from four distinct Arabic dialects into MSA. Our investigation explores the efficacy of various models, including Jais, NLLB, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, in this dialect-to-MSA translation endeavor. Our findings reveal that Jais surpasses all other models, boasting an average BLEU score of 19.48 in the combination of zero- and few-shot setting, whereas NLLB exhibits the least favorable performance, garnering a BLEU score of 8.77.",
    "ArabicMMLU: Assessing Massive Multitask Language Understanding in Arabic": "The focus of language model evaluation has transitioned towards reasoning and knowledge-intensive tasks, driven by advancements in pre-training large models. While state-of-the-art models are partially trained on large Arabic texts, evaluating their performance in Arabic remains challenging due to the limited availability of relevant datasets. To bridge this gap, we present ArabicMMLU, the first multi-task language understanding benchmark for the Arabic language, sourced from school exams across diverse educational levels in different countries spanning North Africa, the Levant, and the Gulf regions. Our data comprises 40 tasks and 14,575 multiple-choice questions in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and is carefully constructed by collaborating with native speakers in the region. Our comprehensive evaluations of 35 models reveal substantial room for improvement, particularly among the best open-source models. Notably, BLOOMZ, mT0, LLaMA2, and Falcon struggle to achieve a score of 50%, while even the top-performing Arabic-centric model only achieves a score of 62.3%.",
    "ArabLegalEval: A Multitask Benchmark for Assessing Arabic Legal Knowledge in Large Language Models": "The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks. However, the evaluation of LLMs' legal knowledge, particularly in non-English languages such as Arabic, remains under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce ArabLegalEval, a multitask benchmark dataset for assessing the Arabic legal knowledge of LLMs. Inspired by the MMLU and LegalBench datasets, ArabLegalEval consists of multiple tasks sourced from Saudi legal documents and synthesized questions. In this work, we aim to analyze the capabilities required to solve legal problems in Arabic and benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs. We explore the impact of in-context learning and investigate various evaluation methods. Additionally, we explore workflows for generating questions with automatic validation to enhance the dataset's quality. We benchmark multilingual and Arabic-centric LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Jais, respectively. We also share our methodology for creating the dataset and validation, which can be generalized to other domains. We hope to accelerate AI research in the Arabic Legal domain by releasing the ArabLegalEval dataset and code: https://github.com/Thiqah/ArabLegalEval",
    "AraT5 with Arabic Reverse Dictionary": "This research paper presents our approach for the KSAA-CAD 2024 competition, focusing on Arabic Reverse Dictionary (RD) task (Al-shammari et al., 2024). Leveraging the functionalities of the Arabic Reverse Dictionary, our system allows users to input glosses and retrieve corresponding words. We provide all associated notebooks and developed models on GitHub and Hugging face, respectively. Our task entails working with a dataset comprising dictionary data and word embedding vectors, utilizing three different architectures of contextualized word embeddings: AraELECTRA, AraBERTv2, and camelBERT-MSA. We fine-tune the AraT5v2-base-1024 model for predicting each embedding, considering various hyperparameters for training and validation. Evaluation metrics include ranking accuracy, mean squared error (MSE), and cosine similarity. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both development and test datasets, showcasing promising performance across different embedding types.",
    "ARCHCODE: Incorporating Software Requirements in Code Generation with Large Language Models": "This paper aims to extend the code generation capability of large language models (LLMs) to automatically manage comprehensive software requirements from given textual descriptions. Such requirements include both functional (i.e. achieving expected behavior for inputs) and non-functional (e.g., time/space performance, robustness, maintainability) requirements. However, textual descriptions can either express requirements verbosely or may even omit some of them. We introduce ARCHCODE, a novel framework that leverages in-context learning to organize requirements observed in descriptions and to extrapolate unexpressed requirements from them. ARCHCODE generates requirements from given descriptions, conditioning them to produce code snippets and test cases. Each test case is tailored to one of the requirements, allowing for the ranking of code snippets based on the compliance of their execution results with the requirements. Public benchmarks show that ARCHCODE enhances to satisfy functional requirements, significantly improving Pass@k scores. Furthermore, we introduce HumanEval-NFR, the first evaluation of LLMs' non-functional requirements in code generation, demonstrating ARCHCODE's superiority over baseline methods. The implementation of ARCHCODE and the HumanEval-NFR benchmark are both publicly accessible.",
    "Are AI-Generated Text Detectors Robust to Adversarial Perturbations?": "The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) has sparked concerns about the potential misuse of AI-generated text, as these models can produce content that closely resembles human-generated text. Current detectors for AI-generated text (AIGT) lack robustness against adversarial perturbations, with even minor changes in characters or words causing a reversal in distinguishing between human-created and AI-generated text. This paper investigates the robustness of existing AIGT detection methods and introduces a novel detector, the Siamese Calibrated Reconstruction Network (SCRN). The SCRN employs a reconstruction network to add and remove noise from text, extracting a semantic representation that is robust to local perturbations. We also propose a siamese calibration technique to train the model to make equally confident predictions under different noise, which improves the model's robustness against adversarial perturbations. Experiments on four publicly available datasets show that the SCRN outperforms all baseline methods, achieving 6.5%-18.25% absolute accuracy improvement over the best baseline method under adversarial attacks. Moreover, it exhibits superior generalizability in cross-domain, cross-genre, and mixed-source scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Robust-AIGC-Detector.",
    "Are Decoder-Only Language Models Better than Encoder-Only Language Models in Understanding Word Meaning?": "The natural language processing field has been evolving around language models for the past few years, from the usage of n-gram language models for re-ranking, to transfer learning with encoder-only (BERT-like) language models, and finally to large language models (LLMs) as general solvers. LLMs are dominated by the decoder-only type, and they are popular for their efficacy in numerous tasks. LLMs are regarded as having strong comprehension abilities and strong capabilities to solve new unseen tasks. As such, people may quickly assume that decoder-only LLMs always perform better than the encoder-only ones, especially for understanding word meaning. In this paper, we demonstrate that decoder-only LLMs perform worse on word meaning comprehension than an encoder-only language model that has vastly fewer parameters.",
    "Are Emergent Abilities in Large Language Models just In-Context Learning?": "Large language models, comprising billions of parameters and pre-trained on extensive web-scale corpora, have been claimed to acquire certain capabilities without having been specifically trained on them. These capabilities, referred to as “emergent abilities,” have been a driving force in discussions regarding the potentials and risks of language models. A key challenge in evaluating emergent abilities is that they are confounded by model competencies that arise through alternative prompting techniques, including in-context learning, which is the ability of models to complete a task based on a few examples. We present a novel theory that explains emergent abilities, taking into account their potential confounding factors, and rigorously substantiate this theory through over 1000 experiments. Our findings suggest that purported emergent abilities are not truly emergent, but result from a combination of in-context learning, model memory, and linguistic knowledge. Our work is a foundational step in explaining language model performance, providing a template for their efficient use and clarifying the paradox of their ability to excel in some instances while faltering in others. Thus, we demonstrate that their capabilities should not be overestimated.",
    "Are Generative Language Models Multicultural? A Study on Hausa Culture and Emotions using ChatGPT": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are widely used to generate content for various purposes and audiences. However, these models may not reflect the cultural and emotional diversity of their users, especially for low-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate how ChatGPT represents Hausa's culture and emotions. We compare responses generated by ChatGPT with those provided by native Hausa speakers on 37 culturally relevant questions. We conducted experiments using emotion analysis and applied two similarity metrics to measure the alignment between human and ChatGPT responses. We also collected human participants ratings and feedback on ChatGPT responses. Our results show that ChatGPT has some level of similarity to human responses, but also exhibits some gaps and biases in its knowledge and awareness of the Hausa culture and emotions. We discuss the implications and limitations of our methodology and analysis and suggest ways to improve the performance and evaluation of LLMs for low-resource languages.",
    "Are LLM-based Evaluators Confusing NLG Quality Criteria?": "Some prior work has shown that LLMs perform well in NLG evaluation for different tasks. However, we discover that LLMs seem to confuse different evaluation criteria, which reduces their reliability. For further verification, we first consider avoiding issues of inconsistent conceptualization and vague expression in existing NLG quality criteria themselves. So we summarize a clear hierarchical classification system for 11 common aspects with corresponding different criteria from previous studies involved. Inspired by behavioral testing, we elaborately design 18 types of aspect-targeted perturbation attacks for fine-grained analysis of the evaluation behaviors of different LLMs. We also conduct human annotations beyond the guidance of the classification system to validate the impact of the perturbations. Our experimental results reveal confusion issues inherent in LLMs, as well as other noteworthy phenomena, and necessitate further research and improvements for LLM-based evaluation.",
    "Are LLMs Capable of Data-based Statistical and Causal Reasoning?": "Quantitative reasoning is a critical skill to analyze data, yet the assessment of such ability remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce the Quantitative Reasoning with Data (QRDATA) benchmark, aiming to evaluate Large Language Models' capability in statistical and causal reasoning with real-world data. The benchmark comprises a carefully constructed dataset of 411 questions accompanied by data sheets from textbooks, online learning materials, and academic papers. To compare models' quantitative reasoning abilities on data and text, we enrich the benchmark with an auxiliary set of 290 text-only questions, namely QRTEXT. We evaluate natural language reasoning, program-based reasoning, and agent reasoning methods including Chain-of-Thought, Program-of-Thoughts, ReAct, and code interpreter assistants on diverse models. The strongest model GPT-4 achieves an accuracy of 58%, which has much room for improvement. Among open-source models, Deepseek-coder-instruct, a code LLM pretrained on 2T tokens, gets the highest accuracy of 37%. Analysis reveals that models encounter difficulties in data analysis and causal reasoning, and struggle in using causal knowledge and provided data simultaneously.",
    "Are LLMs classical or nonmonotonic reasoners? Lessons from generics": "Recent scholarship on reasoning in LLMs has supplied evidence of impressive performance and flexible adaptation to machine generated or human feedback. Nonmonotonic reasoning, crucial to human cognition for navigating the real world, remains a challenging, yet under-studied task. In this work, we study nonmonotonic reasoning capabilities of seven state-of-the-art LLMs in one abstract and one commonsense reasoning task featuring generics, such as 'Birds fly', and exceptions, 'Penguins don't fly' (see Fig. 1). While LLMs exhibit reasoning patterns in accordance with human nonmonotonic reasoning abilities, they fail to maintain stable beliefs on truth conditions of generics at the addition of supporting examples ('Owls fly') or unrelated information ('Lions have manes'). Our findings highlight pitfalls in attributing human reasoning behaviours to LLMs, as well as assessing general capabilities, while consistent reasoning remains elusive.",
    "Are Machines Better at Complex Reasoning? Unveiling Human-Machine Inference Gaps in Entailment Verification": "Making inferences in text comprehension to understand the meaning is essential in language processing. This work studies the entailment verification (EV) problem of multi-sentence premises that requires a system to make multiple inferences implicitly. Studying EV for such complex premises is important because modern NLP problems, such as detecting inconsistent model-generated rationales, require complex multi-hop reasoning. However, current textual inference datasets mostly contain short premises that only partially focus on these challenges. To address this, we compile an EV benchmark that includes datasets from three NLP domains (NLI, contextual QA, and rationales) containing multi-sentence premises. On benchmarking humans and LLMs, we find that LLMs are better than humans in multi-hop reasoning across extended contexts, while humans perform better in simple deductive reasoning tasks. We also finetune a Flan-T5 model for EV using two training objectives to obtain a strong open-source model that outperforms GPT-3.5 and rivals GPT-4. Finally, we use this model to filter out inconsistent model-generated rationales in self-consistency decoding, resulting in a 6% accuracy improvement on average across three MCQ datasets.",
    "Are self-explanations from Large Language Models faithful?": "Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks and will even explain their reasoning, so-called self-explanations. However, convincing and wrong self-explanations can lead to unsupported confidence in LLMs, thus increasing risk. Therefore, it's important to measure if self-explanations truly reflect the model's behavior. Such a measure is called interpretability-faithfulness and is challenging to perform since the ground truth is inaccessible, and many LLMs only have an inference API. To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks to measure faithfulness. For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make its prediction without these words. While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been successfully applied to LLM self-explanations for counterfactual, feature attribution, and redaction explanations. Our results demonstrate that faithfulness is explanation, model, and task-dependent, showing self-explanations should not be trusted in general. For example, with sentiment classification, counterfactuals are more faithful for Llama2, feature attribution for Mistral, and redaction for Falcon 40B.",
    "Are U a Joke Master? Pun Generation via Multi-Stage Curriculum Learning towards a Humor LLM": "Although large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive world knowledge and some reasoning abilities, their proficiency in generating humorous sentences remains a challenge. Previous research has demonstrated that the humor generation capabilities of ChatGPT are confined to producing merely 25 unique jokes. In this work, we concentrate on endowing LLMs with the ability of generating puns, a particular category of humor by preference learning method. We propose a multi-stage curriculum preference learning framework to optimize both pun structure preferences and humor preferences. Specifically, we improve the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm to address the challenge of multi-objective alignment problem. Besides, to facilitate further advancement in this field, we collect a Chinese Pun (ChinesePun) dataset, containing 2.1k puns and corresponding annotations. Experimental results on both Chinese and English benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms all the baseline models.",
    "ARIES: A Corpus of Scientific Paper Edits Made in Response to Peer Reviews": "We introduce the task of automatically revising scientific papers based on peer feedback and release ARIES, a dataset of review comments and their corresponding paper edits. The data is drawn from real reviewer-author interactions from computer science, and we provide labels linking each reviewer comment to the specific paper edits made by the author in response. We automatically create a high-precision silver training set, as well as an expert-labeled test set that shows high inter-annotator agreement. In experiments with 10 models covering the state of the art, we find that they struggle even to identify which edits correspond to a comment—especially when the relationship between the edit and the comment is indirect and requires reasoning to uncover. We also extensively analyze GPT-4's ability to generate edits given a comment and the original paper. We find that it often succeeds on a superficial level, but tends to rigidly follow the wording of the feedback rather than the underlying intent, and lacks technical details compared to human-written edits.",
    "Arithmetic Control of LLMs for Diverse User Preferences: Directional Preference Alignment with Multi-Objective Rewards": "Fine-grained control over large language models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge, hindering their adaptability to diverse user needs. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) shows promise in aligning LLMs, its reliance on scalar rewards often limits its ability to capture diverse user preferences in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we introduce the Directional Preference Alignment (DPA) framework. Unlike the scalar-reward RLHF, DPA incorporates multi-objective reward modeling to represent diverse preference profiles. Additionally, DPA models user preferences as directions (i.e., unit vectors) in the reward space to achieve user-dependent preference control. Our method involves training a multi-objective reward model and then fine-tuning the LLM with a preference-conditioned variant of Rejection Sampling Finetuning (RSF), an RLHF method adopted by Llama 2. This method enjoys a better performance trade-off across various reward objectives. In comparison with the scalar-reward RLHF, DPA offers users intuitive control over LLM generation: they can arithmetically specify their desired trade-offs (e.g., more helpfulness with less verbosity). We also validate the effectiveness of DPA with real-world alignment experiments on Mistral-7B. Our method provides straightforward arithmetic control over the trade-off between helpfulness and verbosity while maintaining competitive performance with strong baselines such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The code and trained model are released at https://github.com/RLHFlow/directional-preference-alignment.",
    "ARL2: Aligning Retrievers for Black-box Large Language Models via Self-guided Adaptive Relevance Labeling": "Retrieval-augmented generation enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating relevant information from external knowledge sources. This enables LLMs to adapt to specific domains and mitigate hallucinations in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing retrievers are often misaligned with LLMs due to their separate training processes and the black-box nature of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose ARL2, a retriever learning technique that harnesses LLMs as labelers. ARL2 leverages LLMs to annotate and score relevance evidence, enabling learning the retriever from robust LLM supervision. Furthermore, ARL2 uses an adaptive self-training strategy for curating high-quality and diverse relevance data, which can effectively reduce the annotation cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ARL2, achieving accuracy improvements of 5.4% on NQ and 4.6% on MMLU compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ARL2 exhibits robust transfer learning capabilities and strong zero-shot generalization abilities.",
    "Artifacts or Abduction: How Do LLMs Answer Multiple-Choice Questions Without the Question?": "Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is often used to evaluate large language models (LLMs). To see if MCQA assesses LLMs as intended, we probe if LLMs can perform MCQA with choices-only prompts, where models must select the correct answer only from the choices. In three MCQA datasets and four LLMs, this prompt bests a majority baseline in 11/12 cases, with up to 0.33 accuracy gain. To help explain this behavior, we conduct an in-depth, black-box analysis on memorization, choice dynamics, and question inference. Our key findings are threefold. First, we find no evidence that the choices-only accuracy stems from memorization alone. Second, priors over individual choices do not fully explain choices-only accuracy, hinting that LLMs use the group dynamics of choices. Third, LLMs have some ability to infer a relevant question from choices, and surprisingly can sometimes even match the original question. Inferring the original question is an impressive reasoning strategy, but it cannot fully explain the high choices-only accuracy of LLMs in MCQA. Thus, while LLMs are not fully incapable of reasoning in MCQA, we still advocate for the use of stronger baselines in MCQA benchmarks, the design of robust MCQA datasets for fair evaluations, and further efforts to explain LLM decision-making.",
    "Artificial Intuition: Efficient Classification of Scientific Abstracts": "It is desirable to coarsely classify short scientific texts, such as grant or publication abstracts, for strategic insight or research portfolio management. These texts efficiently transmit dense information to experts possessing a rich body of knowledge to aid interpretation. Yet this task is remarkably difficult to automate because of brevity and the absence of context. To address this gap, we have developed a novel approach to generate and appropriately assign coarse domain-specific labels. We show that a Large Language Model (LLM) can provide metadata essential to the task, in a process akin to the augmentation of supplemental knowledge representing human intuition, and propose a workflow. As a pilot study, we use a corpus of award abstracts from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). We develop new assessment tools in concert with established performance metrics.",
    "ArtPrompt: ASCII Art-based Jailbreak Attacks against Aligned LLMs": "Safety is critical to the usage of large language models (LLMs). Multiple techniques such as data filtering and supervised fine-tuning have been developed to strengthen LLM safety. However, currently known techniques presume that corpora used for safety alignment of LLMs are solely interpreted by semantics. This assumption, however, does not hold in real-world applications, which leads to severe vulnerabilities in LLMs. For example, users of forums often use ASCII art, a form of text-based art, to convey image information. In this paper, we propose a novel ASCII art-based jailbreak attack and introduce a comprehensive benchmark Vision-in-Text Challenge (VITC) to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in recognizing prompts that cannot be solely interpreted by semantics. We show that five SOTA LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, and Llama2) struggle to recognize prompts provided in the form of ASCII art. Based on this observation, we develop the jailbreak attack ArtPrompt, which leverages the poor performance of LLMs in recognizing ASCII art to bypass safety measures and elicit undesired behaviors from LLMs. ArtPrompt only requires black-box access to the victim LLMs, making it a practical attack. We evaluate ArtPrompt on five SOTA LLMs, and show that ArtPrompt can effectively and efficiently induce undesired behaviors from all five LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/uw-nsl/ArtPrompt.",
    "AS-ES Learning: Towards Efficient CoT Learning in Small Models": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) serves as a critical emerging ability in LLMs, especially when it comes to logical reasoning. Attempts have been made to induce such ability in small models as well by distilling from the data with CoT generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods often simply generate and incorporate more data from LLMs and fail to note the importance of efficiently utilizing existing CoT data. We here propose a new training paradigm AS-ES (Abstractive Segments - Extractive Segments) learning, which exploits the inherent information in CoT for iterative generation. Experiments show that our methods surpass the direct seq2seq training on CoT-extensive tasks like MWP and PET summarization, without data augmentation or altering the model itself. Furthermore, we explore the reason behind the inefficiency of small models in learning CoT and provide an explanation of why AS-ES learning works, giving insights into the underlying mechanism of CoT.",
    "Ask Again, Then Fail: Large Language Models' Vacillations in Judgment": "We observe that current large language models often waver in their judgments when faced with follow-up questions, even if the original judgment was correct. This wavering presents a significant challenge for generating reliable responses and building user trust. To comprehensively assess this issue, we introduce a FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONING MECHANISM along with two metrics to quantify this inconsistency, confirming its widespread presence in current large language models. Furthermore, to mitigate this issue, we explore various prompting strategies for closed-source models, and develop a training-based framework UNWAVERING-FQ that teaches large language models to maintain their originally correct judgments through synthesized high-quality preference data. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our framework and its ability to enhance the general capabilities of large language models.",
    "ASPIRE: Language-Guided Data Augmentation for Improving Robustness Against Spurious Correlations": "Neural image classifiers can often learn to make predictions by overly relying on non-predictive features that are spuriously correlated with the class labels in the training data. This leads to poor performance in real-world atypical scenarios where such features are absent. This paper presents ASPIRE (Language-guided Data Augmentation for SPurIous correlation REmoval), a simple yet effective solution for supplementing the training dataset with images without spurious features, for robust learning against spurious correlations via better generalization. ASPIRE, guided by language at various steps, can generate non-spurious images without requiring any group labeling or existing non-spurious images in the training set. Precisely, we employ LLMs to first extract foreground and background features from textual descriptions of an image, followed by advanced language-guided image editing to discover the features that are spuriously correlated with the class label. Finally, we personalize a text-to-image generation model using the edited images to generate diverse in-domain images without spurious features. ASPIRE is complementary to all prior robust training methods in literature, and we demonstrate its effectiveness across 4 datasets and 9 baselines and show that ASPIRE improves the worst-group classification accuracy of prior methods by 1% - 38%. We also contribute a novel test set for the challenging Hard ImageNet dataset.",
    "Assessing the Effectiveness of GPT-4o in Climate Change Evidence Synthesis and Systematic Assessments: Preliminary Insights": "In this research short, we examine the potential of using GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) to undertake evidence synthesis and systematic assessment tasks. Traditional workflows for such tasks involve large groups of domain experts who manually review and synthesize vast amounts of literature. The exponential growth of scientific literature and recent advances in LLMs provide an opportunity to complementing these traditional workflows with new age tools. We assess the efficacy of GPT-4o to do these tasks on a sample from the dataset created by the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI) where we check the accuracy of climate change adaptation related feature extraction from the scientific literature across three levels of expertise. Our results indicate that while GPT-4o can achieve high accuracy in low-expertise tasks like geographic location identification, their performance in intermediate and high-expertise tasks, such as stakeholder identification and assessment of depth of the adaptation response, is less reliable. The findings motivate the need for designing assessment workflows that utilize the strengths of models like GPT-4o while also providing refinements to improve their performance on these tasks.",
    "Attribute First, then Generate: Locally-attributable Grounded Text Generation": "Recent efforts to address hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) have focused on attributed text generation, which supplements generated texts with citations of supporting sources for post-generation fact-checking and corrections. Yet, these citations often point to entire documents or paragraphs, burdening users with extensive verification work. In this paper, we introduce a locally-attributable text generation approach, prioritizing concise attributions. Our method, named “Attribute First, then Generate”, breaks down the conventional end-to-end generation process into three intuitive steps: content selection, sentence planning, and sequential sentence generation. By initially identifying relevant source segments (“select first”) and then conditioning the generation process on them (“then generate”), we ensure these segments also act as the output's fine-grained attributions (“select” becomes “attribute”). Tested on Multi-document Summarization and Long-form Question-answering, our method not only yields more concise citations than the baselines but also maintains—and in some cases enhances—both generation quality and attribution accuracy. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the time required for fact verification by human assessors.",
    "AttributionBench: How Hard is Automatic Attribution Evaluation?": "Modern generative search engines enhance the reliability of large language model (LLM) responses by providing cited evidence. However, evaluating the answer's attribution, i.e., whether every claim within the generated responses is fully supported by its cited evidence, remains an open problem. This verification, traditionally dependent on costly human evaluation, underscores the urgent need for automatic attribution evaluation methods. To bridge the gap in the absence of standardized benchmarks for these methods, we present AttributionBench, a comprehensive benchmark compiled from various existing attribution datasets. Our extensive experiments on AttributionBench reveal the challenges of automatic attribution evaluation, even for state-of-the-art LLMs. Specifically, our findings show that even a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 only achieves around 80% macro-F1 under a binary classification formulation. A detailed analysis of more than 300 error cases indicates that a majority of failures stem from the model's inability to process nuanced information, and the discrepancy between the information the model has access to and that human annotators do.",
    "AustroTox: A Dataset for Target-Based Austrian German Offensive Language Detection": "Model interpretability in toxicity detection greatly profits from token-level annotations. However, currently such annotations are only available in English. We introduce a dataset annotated for offensive language detection sourced from a news forum, notable for its incorporation of the Austrian German dialect, comprising 4,562 user comments. In addition to binary offensiveness classification, we identify spans within each comment constituting vulgar language or representing targets of offensive statements. We evaluate fine-tuned language models as well as large language models in a zero- and few-shot fashion. The results indicate that while fine-tuned models excel in detecting linguistic peculiarities such as vulgar dialect, large language models demonstrate superior performance in detecting offensiveness in AustroTox. We publish the data and code.",
    "AUTOACT: Automatic Agent Learning from Scratch for QA via Self-Planning": "Language agents have achieved considerable performance on various complex question-answering tasks by planning with external tools. Despite the incessant exploration in this field, existing language agent systems still struggle with costly, non-reproducible data reliance and face the challenge of compelling a single model for multiple functions. To this end, we introduce AUTOACT, an automatic agent learning framework for QA that does not rely on large-scale annotated data and synthetic planning trajectories from closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4). Given limited data with a tool library, AUTOACT first automatically synthesizes planning trajectories without any assistance from humans or strong closed-source models. Then, AUTOACT leverages a division-of-labor strategy to automatically differentiate based on the target task information and synthesized trajectories, producing a sub-agent group to complete the task. We conduct comprehensive experiments with different LLMs, which demonstrates that AUTOACT yields better or parallel performance compared to various strong baselines. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the division-of-labor strategy, with the trajectory quality generated by AUTOACT generally outperforming that of others.",
    "AUTOCAP: Towards Automatic Cross-lingual Alignment Planning for Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought": "Cross-lingual chain-of-thought can effectively complete reasoning tasks across languages, which gains increasing attention. Recently, dominant approaches in the literature improve cross-lingual alignment capabilities by integrating reasoning knowledge from different languages. Despite achieving excellent performance, current methods still have two main challenges: (1) Manual language specification: They still highly rely on manually selecting the languages to integrate, severely affecting their generalizability; (2) Static weight allocation: Current methods simply integrate all languages equally. In fact, different language reasoning paths should have different weights to achieve better complementation and integration. Motivated by this, we introduce an Automatic Cross-lingual Alignment Planning (AUTOCAP) for zero-shot chain-of-thought to address the above challenges. The core of AUTOCAP consists of two components: (1) Automatic Language Selection Prompting to guide LLMs to select appropriate languages and (2) Automatic Weight Allocation Prompting to automatically allocate alignment weight scores to each reasoning path. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks reveal that AUTOCAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods that required manual effort.",
    "Automated Focused Feedback Generation for Scientific Writing Assistance": "Scientific writing is a challenging task, particularly for novice researchers who often rely on feedback from experienced peers. Recent work has primarily focused on improving surface form and style rather than manuscript content. In this paper, we propose a novel task: automated focused feedback generation for scientific writing assistance. We present SWIF2T: a Scientific WrIting Focused Feedback Tool. It is designed to generate specific, actionable and coherent comments, which identify weaknesses in a scientific paper and/or propose revisions to it. Our approach consists of four components - planner, investigator, reviewer and controller - leveraging multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to implement them. We compile a dataset of 300 peer reviews citing weaknesses in scientific papers and conduct human evaluation. The results demonstrate the superiority in specificity, reading comprehension, and overall helpfulness of SWIF2T's feedback compared to other approaches. In our analysis, we also identified cases where automatically generated reviews were judged better than human ones, suggesting opportunities for integration of AI-generated feedback in scientific writing.",
    "Automatic and Human-AI Interactive Text Generation (with a focus on Text Simplification and Revision)": "In this tutorial, we focus on text-to-text generation, a class of natural language generation (NLG) tasks, that takes a piece of text as input and then generates a revision that is improved according to some specific criteria (e.g., readability or linguistic styles), while largely retaining the original meaning and the length of the text. This includes many useful applications, such as text simplification, paraphrase generation, style transfer, etc. In contrast to text summarization and open-ended text completion (e.g., story), the text-to-text generation tasks we discuss in this tutorial are more constrained in terms of semantic consistency and targeted language styles. This level of control makes these tasks ideal testbeds for studying the ability of models to generate text that is both semantically adequate and stylistically appropriate. Moreover, these tasks are interesting from a technical standpoint, as they require complex combinations of lexical and syntactical transformations, stylistic control, and adherence to factual knowledge, - all at once. With a special focus on text simplification and revision, this tutorial aims to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art natural language generation research from four major aspects - Data, Models, Human-AI Collaboration, and Evaluation - and to discuss and showcase a few significant and recent advances: (1) the use of non-retrogressive approaches; (2) the shift from fine-tuning to prompting with large language models; (3) the development of new learnable metric and fine-grained human evaluation framework; (4) a growing body of studies and datasets on non-English languages; (5) the rise of HCI+NLP+Accessibility interdisciplinary research to create real-world writing assistant systems.",
    "Automatic Bug Detection in LLM-Powered Text-Based Games Using LLMs": "Advancements in large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing interactive game design, enabling dynamic plotlines and interactions between players and non-player characters (NPCs). However, LLMs may exhibit flaws such as hallucinations, forgetfulness, or misinterpretations of prompts, causing logical inconsistencies and unexpected deviations from intended designs. Automated techniques for detecting such game bugs are still lacking. To address this, we propose a systematic LLM-based method for automatically identifying such bugs from player game logs, eliminating the need for collecting additional data such as post-play surveys. Applied to a text-based game DejaBoom!, our approach effectively identifies bugs inherent in LLM-powered interactive games, surpassing unstructured LLM-powered bug-catching methods and filling the gap in automated detection of logical and design flaws.",
    "Automatic Engineering of Long Prompts": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex open-domain tasks, guided by comprehensive instructions and demonstrations provided in the form of prompts. However, these prompts can be lengthy, often comprising hundreds of lines and thousands of tokens, and their design often requires considerable human effort. Recent research has explored automatic prompt engineering for short prompts, typically consisting of one or a few sentences. However, the automatic design of long prompts remains a challenging problem due to its immense search space. In this paper, we propose an algorithm named Automated Prompt Engineering Xpert (APEX), a novel algorithm that automatically improves long prompts. Leveraging a greedy algorithm with beam-search for efficiency, APEX utilizes search history to significantly enhance the effectiveness of LLM-based mutation in its search process. Our results show that APEX achieves an average of 9.2% accuracy gain on eight tasks in Big Bench Hard and a consistent improvements on GSM8K with various models, highlighting the significance of automating prompt designs to fully harness the capabilities of LLMs.",
    "Automatic Subtitling and Subtitle Compression: FBK at the IWSLT 2024 Subtitling track": "The paper describes the FBK submissions to the Subtitling track of the 2024 IWSLT Evaluation Campaign, which covers both the Automatic Subtitling and the Subtitle Compression task for two language pairs: English to German and English to Spanish. For the Automatic Subtitling task, we submitted two systems each covering one of the two proposed training conditions, namely constrained and unconstrained: i) a direct model, trained in constrained conditions, that produces the SRT files from the audio without intermediate outputs (e.g., transcripts), and ii) a cascade solution that integrates only free-to-use and freely trained components, either taken off-the-shelf or developed in-house. Results show that, on both language pairs, our direct model outperforms both cascade and direct systems trained in constrained conditions in last year's edition of the campaign, while our solution assembling pre-trained models is competitive with the best 2023 systems, although they were fine-tuned on task specific training data. For the Subtitle Compression task, our primary submission involved prompting a Large Language Model in zero-shot mode to shorten subtitles that exceed the reading speed limit of 21 characters per second. Our results highlight the challenges inherent in shrinking out-of-context sentence fragments that are automatically generated and potentially error-prone, underscoring the need for future studies to develop targeted solutions.",
    "Automatically Suggesting Diverse Example Sentences for L2 Japanese Learners Using Pre-Trained Language Models": "Providing example sentences that are diverse and aligned with learners' proficiency levels is essential for fostering effective language acquisition. This study examines the use of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to produce example sentences targeting L2 Japanese learners. We utilize PLMs in two ways: as quality scoring components in a retrieval system that draws from a newly curated corpus of Japanese sentences, and as direct sentence generators using zero-shot learning. We evaluate the quality of sentences by considering multiple aspects such as difficulty, diversity, and naturalness, with a panel of raters consisting of learners of Japanese, native speakers - and GPT-4. Our findings suggest that there is inherent disagreement among participants on the ratings of sentence qualities, except for difficulty. Despite that, the retrieval approach was preferred by all evaluators, especially for beginner and advanced target proficiency, while the generative approaches received lower scores on average. Even so, our experiments highlight the potential for using PLMs to enhance the adaptability of sentence suggestion systems and therefore improve the language learning journey.",
    "Automating Qualitative Data Analysis with Large Language Models": "This PhD proposal aims to investigate ways of automating qualitative data analysis, specifically the thematic coding of texts. Despite existing methods vastly covered in literature, they mainly use Topic Modeling and other quantitative approaches which are far from resembling a human's analysis outcome. This proposal examines the limitations of current research in the field. It proposes a novel methodology based on Large Language Models to tackle automated coding and make it as close as possible to the results of human researchers. This paper covers studies already done in this field and their limitations, existing software, the problem of duplicating the researcher bias, and the proposed methodology.",
    "Autonomous Workflow for Multimodal Fine-Grained Training Assistants": "Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents have emerged as promising protocols for automatically understanding the language-based environment, particularly with the exponential development of large language models (LLMs). However, a fine-grained, comprehensive understanding of multimodal environments remains under-explored. This work designs an autonomous workflow tailored for integrating AI agents seamlessly into mixed reality (MR) applications for fine-grained training. We present a demonstration of a multimodal fine-grained training assistant for LEGO brick assembly in a pilot MR environment. Specifically, we design a cerebral language agent that integrates LLMs with memory, planning, and interaction with MR tools and a vision-language agent, enabling agents to decide their actions based on past experiences. Furthermore, we introduce LEGO-MRTA, a multimodal fine-grained assembly dialogue dataset synthesized automatically in the workflow served by a commercial LLM. This dataset comprises multimodal instruction manuals, conversations, MR responses, and vision question answering. Last, we present several prevailing open-resource LLMs as benchmarks, assessing their performance with and without fine-tuning on the proposed dataset. We anticipate that the broader impact of this workflow will advance the development of smarter assistants for seamless user interaction in MR environments, fostering research in both AI and HCI communities.",
    "AutoRE: Document-Level Relation Extraction with Large Language Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities in comprehending and generating text, motivating numerous researchers to utilize them for Information Extraction (IE) purposes, including Relation Extraction (RE). Nonetheless, most existing methods are predominantly designed for Sentence-level Relation Extraction (SentRE) tasks, which typically encompass a restricted set of relations and triplet facts within a single sentence. Furthermore, certain approaches resort to treating relations as candidate choices integrated into prompt templates, leading to inefficient processing and suboptimal performance when tackling Document-Level Relation Extraction (DocRE) tasks, which entail handling multiple relations and triplet facts distributed across a given document, posing distinct challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AutoRE, an end-to-end DocRE model that adopts a novel RE extraction paradigm named RHF (Relation-Head-Facts). Unlike existing approaches, AutoRE does not rely on the assumption of known relation options, making it more reflective of real-world scenarios. Additionally, we have developed an easily extensible RE framework using a Parameters Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) algorithm (QLoRA). Our experiments on the RE-DocRED dataset showcase AutoRE's best performance, achieving state-of-the-art results, surpassing TAG by 10.03% and 9.03% respectively on the dev and test set. The code is available1 and the demonstration video is provided2.",
    "AutoRef : Generating Refinements of Reviews Given Guidelines": "When examining reviews of research papers, we can distinguish between two hypothetical referees: the maximally lenient referee who accepts any paper with a vacuous review and the maximally strict one who rejects any paper with an overly pedantic review. Clearly, both are of no practical value. Our interest is in a referee who makes a balanced judgement and provides a review abiding by the guidelines. In this paper, we present a case study of automatic correction of an existing machine-generated or human review. The AutoRef system implements an iterative approach that progressively “refines” a review by attempting to make it more compliant with pre-defined requirements of a “good” review. It implements the following steps: (1) Translate the review requirements into a specification in natural language, of “yes/no” questions; (2) Given a (paper, review) pair, extract answers to the questions; (3) Use the results in (2) to generate a new review; and (4) Return to Step (2) with the paper and the new review. Here, (2) and (3) are implemented by large language model (LLM) based agents. We present a case study using papers and reviews made available for the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR). Our initial empirical results suggest that AutoRef progressively improves the compliance of the generated reviews to the specification. Currently designed specification makes AutoRef progressively generate reviews which are stricter, making the decisions more inclined towards “rejections”. This demonstrates the applicability of AutoRef for: (1) The progressive correction of overly lenient reviews, being useful for referees and meta-reviewers; and (2) The generation of progressively stricter reviews for a paper, starting from a vacuous review (“Great paper. Accept.”), facilitating authors when trying to assess weaknesses in their papers.",
    "Aya Dataset: An Open-Access Collection for Multilingual Instruction Tuning": "Datasets are foundational to many breakthroughs in modern artificial intelligence (AI). Many recent achievements in the space of natural language processing (NLP) can be attributed to the fine-tuning of pre-trained models on a diverse set of tasks that enables a large language model (LLM) to respond to instructions. Instruction fine-tuning (IFT) requires specifically constructed and annotated datasets. However, existing datasets are almost all in the English language. In this work, our primary goal is to bridge the language gap by building a human-curated instruction-following dataset spanning 65 languages. We worked with fluent speakers of languages from around the world to collect natural instances of instructions and completions. Furthermore, we create the most extensive multilingual collection to date, comprising 513 million instances through templating and augmenting existing datasets across 114 languages. In total, we contribute three key resources: we develop and open-source the Aya 1 Dataset, the Aya Collection, and the Aya Evaluation Suite. The Aya initiative also serves as a valuable case study in participatory research, involving collaborators from 119 countries. We see this as an important framework for future research collaborations that aim to bridge gaps in resources.",
    "Aya Model: An Instruction Finetuned Open-Access Multilingual Language Model": "Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have centered around a handful of data-rich languages. What does it take to broaden access to breakthroughs beyond first-class citizen languages? Our work introduces Aya, a massively multilingual generative language model that follows instructions in 101 languages of which over 50% are considered as lower-resourced. Aya outperforms mT0 and BLOOMZ on the majority of tasks while covering double the number of languages. We introduce extensive new evaluation suites that broaden the state-of-art for multilingual eval across 99 languages — including discriminative and generative tasks, human evaluation, and simulated win rates that cover both held-out tasks and in-distribution performance. Furthermore, we conduct detailed investigations on the optimal finetuning mixture composition, data pruning, as well as the toxicity, bias, and safety of our models.",
    "Back to Basics: Revisiting REINFORCE-Style Optimization for Learning from Human Feedback in LLMs": "AI alignment in the shape of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly treated as a crucial ingredient for high performance large language models. PROXIMAL POLICY OPTIMIZATION (PPO) has been positioned by recent literature as the canonical method for the RL part of RLHF. However, it involves both high computational cost and sensitive hyperparameter tuning. We posit that most of the motivational principles that led to the development of PPO are less of a practical concern in RLHF and advocate for a less computationally expensive method that preserves and even increases performance. We revisit the formulation of alignment from human preferences in the context of RL. Keeping simplicity as a guiding principle, we show that many components of PPO are unnecessary in an RLHF context and that far simpler REINFORCE-style optimization variants outperform both PPO and newly proposed “RL-free” methods such as DPO and RAFT. Our work suggests that careful adaptation to LLMs alignment characteristics enables benefiting from online RL optimization at low cost.",
    "BadAgent: Inserting and Activating Backdoor Attacks in LLM Agents": "With the prosperity of large language models (LLMs), powerful LLM-based intelligent agents have been developed to provide customized services with a set of user-defined tools. State-of-the-art methods for constructing LLM agents adopt trained LLMs and further fine-tune them on data for the agent task. However, we show that such methods are vulnerable to our proposed backdoor attacks named BadAgent on various agent tasks, where a backdoor can be embedded by fine-tuning on the backdoor data. At test time, the attacker can manipulate the deployed LLM agents to execute harmful operations by showing the trigger in the agent input or environment. To our surprise, our proposed attack methods are extremely robust even after fine-tuning on trustworthy data. Though backdoor attacks have been studied extensively in natural language processing, to the best of our knowledge, we could be the first to study them on LLM agents that are more dangerous due to the permission to use external tools. Our work demonstrates the clear risk of constructing LLM agents based on untrusted LLMs or data. Our code is public at https://github.com/DPamK/BadAgent",
    "Balanced Data Sampling for Language Model Training with Clustering": "Data plays a fundamental role in the training of Large Language Models (LLMs). While attention has been paid to the collection and composition of datasets, determining the data sampling strategy in training remains an open question. Most LLMs are trained with a simple strategy, random sampling. However, this sampling strategy ignores the unbalanced nature of training data distribution, which can be sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose ClusterClip Sampling to balance the text distribution of training data for better model training. Specifically, ClusterClip Sampling utilizes data clustering to reflect the data distribution of the training set and balances the common samples and rare samples during training based on the cluster results. A repetition clip operation is introduced to mitigate the overfitting issue led by samples from certain clusters. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of ClusterClip Sampling, which outperforms random sampling and other cluster-based sampling variants under various training datasets and large language models.",
    "Balancing Speciality and Versatility: a Coarse to Fine Framework for Supervised Fine-tuning Large Language Model": "Aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase remarkable versatility, capable of handling diverse real-world tasks. Meanwhile, aligned LLMs are also expected to exhibit speciality, excelling in specific applications. However, fine-tuning with extra data, a common practice to gain speciality, often leads to catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previously acquired versatility, hindering the model's performance across diverse tasks. In response to this challenge, we propose CoFiTune, a coarse to fine framework in an attempt to strike the balance between speciality and versatility. At the coarse-grained level, an empirical tree-search algorithm is utilized to pinpoint and update specific modules that are crucial for speciality, while keeping other parameters frozen; at the fine-grained level, a soft-masking mechanism regulates the update to the LLMs, mitigating the CF issue without compromising speciality. In an overall evaluation of both speciality and versatility, CoFiTune consistently outperforms baseline methods across diverse tasks and model scales. When compared to the full-parameter SFT, CoFiTune offers an average versatility improvement of 14%, while only incurring a marginal loss in speciality. Lastly, based on further analysis, we provide a speculative insight into the information forwarding process in LLMs, which helps explain the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/rattlesnakey/CoFiTune.",
    "BAMBINO-LM: (Bilingual-)Human-Inspired Continual Pre-training of BabyLM": "Children from bilingual backgrounds benefit from interactions with parents and teachers to re-acquire their heritage language. In this paper, we investigate how this insight from behavioral study can be incorporated into the learning of small-scale language models. We introduce BAMBINO-LM, a continual pre-training strategy for BabyLM that uses a novel combination of alternation and PPO-based perplexity reward induced from a parent Italian model. Upon evaluation on zero-shot classification tasks for English and Italian, BAMBINO-LM improves the Italian language capability of a BabyLM baseline. Our ablation analysis demonstrates that employing both the alternation strategy and PPO-based modeling is key to this effectiveness gain. We also show that, as a side effect, the proposed method leads to a similar degradation in L1 effectiveness as human children would have had in an equivalent learning scenario. Through its modeling and findings, BAMBINO-LM makes a focused contribution to the pre-training of small-scale language models by first developing a human-inspired strategy for pre-training and then showing that it results in behaviours similar to that of humans.",
    "BASS: Batched Attention-optimized Speculative Sampling": "Speculative decoding has emerged as a powerful method to improve latency and throughput in hosting large language models. However, most existing implementations focus on generating a single sequence. Real-world generative AI applications often require multiple responses and how to perform speculative decoding in a batched setting while preserving its latency benefits poses non-trivial challenges. This paper describes a system of batched speculative decoding that sets a new state of the art in multi-sequence generation latency and that demonstrates superior GPU utilization as well as quality of generations within a time budget. For example, for a 7.8B-size model on a single A100 GPU and with a batch size of 8, each sequence is generated at an average speed of 5.8ms per token, the overall throughput being 1.1K tokens per second. These results represent state-of-the-art latency and a 2.15× speed-up over optimized regular decoding. Within a time budget that regular decoding does not finish, our system is able to generate sequences with HumanEval Pass@First of 43% and Pass@All of 61%, far exceeding what's feasible with single-sequence speculative decoding. Our peak GPU utilization during decoding reaches as high as 15.8%, more than 3× the highest of that of regular decoding and around 10× of single-sequence speculative decoding.",
    "Batch-ICL: Effective, Efficient, and Order-Agnostic In-Context Learning": "In this paper, by treating in-context learning (ICL) as a meta-optimization process, we explain why LLMs are sensitive to the order of ICL examples. This understanding leads us to the development of Batch-ICL, an effective, efficient, and order-agnostic inference algorithm for ICL. Differing from the standard N-shot learning approach, Batch-ICL employs N separate 1-shot forward computations and aggregates the resulting meta-gradients. These aggregated meta-gradients are then applied to the forward computation of a zero-shot query to generate the final prediction. This batch processing approach renders the LLM agnostic to the order of ICL examples. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that Batch-ICL consistently outperforms most permutations of ICL examples. In some cases, it even exceeds the performance of the best order for standard ICL, all while reducing the computational resources required. Furthermore, we develop a novel variant of Batch-ICL featuring multiple “epochs” of meta-optimization. This variant implicitly explores permutations of ICL examples, further enhancing ICL performance.",
    "BatchEval: Towards Human-like Text Evaluation": "Significant progress has been made in automatic text evaluation with the introduction of large language models (LLMs) as evaluators. However, current sample-wise evaluation paradigm suffers from the following issues: (1) Sensitive to prompt design; (2) Poor resistance to context noise; (3) Inferior ensemble performance with static reference. Inspired by the fact that humans treat both criterion definition and inter sample comparison as references for evaluation, we propose BATCHEVAL, a paradigm that conducts batch-wise evaluation iteratively to alleviate the above problems. We explore variants under this paradigm and confirm the optimal settings are two stage procedure with heterogeneous batch composition strategy and decimal scoring format. Comprehensive experiments across 3 LLMs on 4 text evaluation tasks demonstrate that BATCHEVAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10.5% on Pearson correlations with only 64% API cost on average. Further analyses have verified the robustness, generalization, and working mechanism of BATCHEVAL.",
    "Bayesian Prompt Ensembles: Model Uncertainty Estimation for Black-Box Large Language Models": "An important requirement for the reliable deployment of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) is the well-calibrated quantification of the uncertainty in their outputs. While the likelihood of predicting the next token is a practical surrogate of the data uncertainty learned during training, model uncertainty is challenging to estimate, i.e., due to lack of knowledge acquired during training. Prior efforts to quantify uncertainty of neural networks require specific architectures or (re-)training strategies, which are impractical to apply to LLMs with several billion parameters, or for black-box models where the architecture and parameters are not available. In this paper, we propose Bayesian Prompts Ensembles (BayesPE), a novel approach to effectively obtain well-calibrated uncertainty for the output of pre-trained LLMs. BayesPE computes output probabilities through a weighted ensemble of different, but semantically equivalent, task instruction prompts. The relative weights of the different prompts in the ensemble are estimated through approximate Bayesian variational inference over a small labeled validation set. We demonstrate that BayesPE approximates a Bayesian input layer for the LLM, providing a lower bound on the expected model error. In our extensive experiments, we show that BayesPE achieves significantly superior uncertainty calibration compared to several baselines over a range of natural language classification tasks, both in zero- and few-shot settings.",
    "BBA: Bi-Modal Behavioral Alignment for Reasoning with Large Vision-Language Models": "Multimodal reasoning stands as a pivotal capability for large vision-language models (LVLMs). The integration with Domain-Specific Languages (DSL), offering precise visual representations, equips these models with the opportunity to execute more accurate reasoning in complex and professional domains. However, the vanilla Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting method faces challenges in effectively leveraging the unique strengths of visual and DSL representations, primarily due to their differing reasoning mechanisms. Additionally, it often falls short in addressing critical steps in multi-step reasoning tasks. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce the Bi-Modal Behavioral Alignment (BBA) prompting method, designed to maximize the potential of DSL in augmenting complex multi-modal reasoning tasks. This method initiates by guiding LVLMs to create separate reasoning chains for visual and DSL representations. Subsequently, it aligns these chains by addressing any inconsistencies, thus achieving a cohesive integration of behaviors from different modalities. Our experiments demonstrate that BBA substantially improves the performance of GPT-4V(ision) on geometry problem solving (28.34% → 34.22%), chess positional advantage prediction (42.08% → 46.99%) and molecular property prediction (77.47% → 83.52%).",
    "BeamAggR: Beam Aggregation Reasoning over Multi-source Knowledge for Multi-hop Question Answering": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they still suffer from factual errors when tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Retrieval-augmented reasoning represents a promising approach. However, significant challenges still persist, including inaccurate and insufficient retrieval for complex questions, as well as difficulty in integrating multi-source knowledge. To address this, we propose Beam Aggregation Reasoning (BeamAggR), a reasoning framework for knowledge-intensive multi-hop QA. BeamAggR explores and prioritizes promising answers at each hop of question. Concretely, we parse the complex questions into trees, which include atom and composite questions, followed by bottom-up reasoning. For atomic questions, the LLM conducts reasoning on multi-source knowledge to get answer candidates. For composite questions, the LLM combines beam candidates, explores multiple reasoning paths through probabilistic aggregation, and prioritizes the most promising trajectory. Extensive experiments on four open-domain multi-hop reasoning datasets show that our method significantly outperforms SOTA methods by 8.5%. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that BeamAggR elicits better knowledge collaboration and answer aggregation.",
    "Before Generation, Align it! A Novel and Effective Strategy for Mitigating Hallucinations in Text-to-SQL Generation": "Large Language Models (LLMs) driven by In-Context Learning (ICL) have significantly improved the performance of text-to-SQL. Previous methods generally employ a two-stage reasoning framework, namely 1) schema linking and 2) logical synthesis, making the framework not only effective but also interpretable. Despite these advancements, the inherent bad nature of the generalization of LLMs often results in hallucinations, which limits the full potential of LLMs. In this work, we first identify and categorize the common types of hallucinations at each stage in text-to-SQL. We then introduce a novel strategy, Task Alignment (TA), designed to mitigate hallucinations at each stage. TA encourages LLMs to take advantage of experiences from similar tasks rather than starting the tasks from scratch. This can help LLMs reduce the burden of generalization, thereby mitigating hallucinations effectively. We further propose TA-SQL, a text-to-SQL framework based on this strategy. The experimental results and comprehensive analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework. Specifically, it enhances the performance of the GPT-4 baseline by 21.23% relatively on BIRD dev and it yields significant improvements across six models and four mainstream, complex text-to-SQL benchmarks. For reproducibility, we release our code and prompt at https://github.com/quge2023/TA-SQL.",
    "Benchmarking and Improving Long-Text Translation with Large Language Models": "Recent studies have illuminated the promising capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in handling long texts. However, their performance in machine translation (MT) of long documents remains underexplored. This paper aims to shed light on how LLMs navigate this complex task, offering a comprehensive evaluation of their capabilities and limitations in long-text MT. First, we collect and construct an instruction-based benchmark dataset, specifically designed for the finetuning and evaluation of LLMs, encompassing multilingual, multi-domain, and document-level parallel data. Second, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between MT and LLM models concerning document-level translation. Our analysis uncovers that LLMs exhibit shortcomings in long-text domains, and their performance diminishes as document size escalates. By exploiting various extrapolation strategies, we enhance the capacity of LLMs to translate longer texts. We release data, code, and models at https://github.com/longyuewangdcu/Document-MT-LLM.",
    "Benchmarking Chinese Commonsense Reasoning of LLMs: From Chinese-Specifics to Reasoning-Memorization Correlations": "We introduce CHARM, the first benchmark for comprehensively and in-depth evaluating the commonsense reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) in Chinese, which covers both globally known and Chinese-specific commonsense. We evaluated 7 English and 12 Chinese-oriented LLMs on CHARM, employing 5 representative prompt strategies for improving LLMs' reasoning ability, such as Chain-of-Thought. Our findings indicated that the LLM's language orientation and the task's domain influence the effectiveness of the prompt strategy, which enriches previous research findings. We built closely-interconnected reasoning and memorization tasks, and found that some LLMs struggle with memorizing Chinese commonsense, affecting their reasoning ability, while others show differences in reasoning despite similar memorization performance. We also evaluated the LLMs' memorization-independent reasoning abilities and analyzed the typical errors. Our study precisely identified the LLMs' strengths and weaknesses, providing the clear direction for optimization. It can also serve as a reference for studies in other fields. We will release CHARM at https://github.com/opendatalab/CHARM.",
    "Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been shown to be effective as automatic evaluators with simple prompting and in-context learning. In this work, we assemble 16 LLMs encompassing four different size ranges and evaluate their output responses by preference ranking from the other LLMs as evaluators. We then evaluate the quality of ranking outputs introducing the COgnitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as EvaluatoRs (COBBLER), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, such as the EGOCENTRIC bias where a model prefers to rank its own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (≈40% of comparisons made by all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 44%, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with humans. According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with human preferences.",
    "Benchmarking Data Science Agents": "In the era of data-driven decision-making, the complexity of data analysis necessitates advanced expertise and tools of data science, presenting significant challenges even for specialists. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising aids as data science agents, assisting humans in data analysis and processing. Yet their practical efficacy remains constrained by the varied demands of real-world applications and complicated analytical process. In this paper, we introduce DSEval - a novel evaluation paradigm, as well as a series of innovative benchmarks tailored for assessing the performance of these agents throughout the entire data science lifecycle. Incorporating a novel bootstrapped annotation method, we streamline dataset preparation, improve the evaluation coverage, and expand benchmarking comprehensiveness. Our findings uncover prevalent obstacles and provide critical insights to inform future advancements in the field.",
    "Benchmarking Knowledge Boundary for Large Language Models: A Different Perspective on Model Evaluation": "In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the development of large language models, achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks. To evaluate the knowledge ability of language models, previous studies have proposed lots of benchmarks based on question-answering pairs. We argue that it is not reliable and comprehensive to evaluate language models with a fixed question or limited paraphrases as the query, since language models are sensitive to prompt. Therefore, we introduce a novel concept named knowledge boundary to encompass both prompt-agnostic and prompt-sensitive knowledge within language models. Knowledge boundary avoids prompt sensitivity in language model evaluations, rendering them more dependable and robust. To explore the knowledge boundary for a given model, we propose a projected gradient descent method with semantic constraints, a new algorithm designed to identify the optimal prompt for each piece of knowledge. Experiments demonstrate a superior performance of our algorithm in computing the knowledge boundary compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we evaluate the ability of multiple language models in several domains with knowledge boundary.",
    "Benchmarking Large Language Models on CFLUE - A Chinese Financial Language Understanding Evaluation Dataset": "In light of recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) that have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), there is an urgent need for new benchmarks to keep pace with the fast development of LLMs. In this paper, we propose CFLUE, the Chinese Financial Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark, designed to assess the capability of LLMs across various dimensions. Specifically, CFLUE provides datasets tailored for both knowledge assessment and application assessment. In knowledge assessment, it consists of 38K+ multiple-choice questions with associated solution explanations. These questions serve dual purposes: answer prediction and question reasoning. In application assessment, CFLUE features 16K+ test instances across distinct groups of NLP tasks such as text classification, machine translation, relation extraction, reading comprehension, and text generation. Upon CFLUE, we conduct a thorough evaluation of representative LLMs. The results reveal that only Qwen-72B, GPT-4, and GPT-4-turbo achieve an accuracy exceeding 60% in answer prediction for knowledge assessment, suggesting that there is still substantial room for improvement in current LLMs. In application assessment, while GPT-4 and GPT-4-turbo rank as the top two performers on average, their significant advantage over open-source LLMs is noticeably diminished, given that Qwen-72B achieves the best performance in 2 out of 5 tasks. The datasets and scripts associated with CFLUE are openly accessible at https://github.com/aliyun/cflue.",
    "Benchmarking Large Language Models on Communicative Medical Coaching: A Dataset and a Novel System": "Traditional applications of natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare have predominantly focused on patient-centered services, enhancing patient interactions and care delivery, such as through medical dialogue systems. However, the potential of NLP to benefit inexperienced doctors, particularly in areas such as communicative medical coaching, remains largely unexplored. We introduce “ChatCoach,” a human-AI cooperative framework designed to assist medical learners in practicing their communication skills during patient consultations. ChatCoach differentiates itself from conventional dialogue systems by offering a simulated environment where medical learners can practice dialogues with a patient agent, while a coach agent provides immediate, structured feedback. This is facilitated by our proposed Generalized Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) approach, which fosters the generation of structured feedback and enhances the utilization of external knowledge sources. Additionally, we have developed a dataset specifically for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) within the ChatCoach framework on communicative medical coaching tasks. Our empirical results validate the effectiveness of ChatCoach.",
    "Benchmarking LLaMA-3 on Arabic Language Generation Tasks": "Open-sourced large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance in a variety of NLP tasks, often catching up with the closed-sourced LLMs like ChatGPT. Among these open LLMs, LLaMA-3-70B has emerged as the most recent and the most prominent one. However, how LLaMA-3-70B would situate itself in multilingual settings, especially in a rich morphological language like Arabic, has yet to be explored. In this work, we focus to bridge this gap by evaluating LLaMA-3-70B on a diverse set of Arabic natural language generation (NLG) benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that comprehensively evaluates LLaMA-3-70B on tasks related to Arabic natural language generation. Our study reveals that LLaMA-3-70B lags behind the closed LLMs like ChatGPT, both in modern standard Arabic (MSA) and dialectal Arabic (DA). We further compare the performance of LLaMA-3-70B with our smaller and dedicated finetuned Arabic models. We find that both LLaMA-3-70B and ChatGPT are outperformed by comparatively smaller dedicated Arabic models, indicating the scope for potential improvement with Arabic-focused LLMs.",
    "Benchmarking Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Medicine": "While large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of medical question answering (QA) tasks, they still face challenges with hallucinations and outdated knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising solution and has been widely adopted. However, a RAG system can involve multiple flexible components, and there is a lack of best practices regarding the optimal RAG setting for various medical purposes. To systematically evaluate such systems, we propose the Medical Information Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation (MIRAGE), a first-of-its-kind benchmark including 7,663 questions from five medical QA datasets. Using MIRAGE, we conducted large-scale experiments with over 1.8 trillion prompt tokens on 41 combinations of different corpora, retrievers, and backbone LLMs through the MEDRAG toolkit introduced in this work. Overall, MEDRAG improves the accuracy of six different LLMs by up to 18% over chain-of-thought prompting, elevating the performance of GPT-3.5 and Mixtral to GPT-4-level. Our results show that the combination of various medical corpora and retrievers achieves the best performance. In addition, we discovered a log-linear scaling property and the “lost-in-the-middle” effects in medical RAG. We believe our comprehensive evaluations can serve as practical guidelines for implementing RAG systems for medicine.",
    "BEnQA: A Question Answering Benchmark for Bengali and English": "In this study, we introduce BEnQA1, a dataset comprising parallel Bengali and English exam questions for middle and high school levels in Bangladesh. Our dataset consists of approximately 5K questions covering several subjects in science with different types of questions, including factual, application, and reasoning-based questions. We benchmark several Large Language Models (LLMs) with our parallel dataset and observe a notable performance disparity between the models in Bengali and English. We also investigate some prompting methods, and find that Chain-of-Thought prompting is beneficial mostly on reasoning questions, but not so much on factual ones. We also find that appending English translation helps to answer questions in Bengali. Our findings point to promising future research directions for improving the performance of LLMs in Bengali and more generally in low-resource languages.",
    "Better Late Than Never: Model-Agnostic Hallucination Post-Processing Framework Towards Clinical Text Summarization": "Clinical text summarization has proven successful in generating concise and coherent summaries. However, these summaries may include unintended text with hallucinations, which can mislead clinicians and patients. Existing methods for mitigating hallucinations can be categorized into task-specific and task-agnostic approaches. Task-specific methods lack versatility for real-world applicability. Meanwhile, task-agnostic methods are not model-agnostic, so they require retraining for different models, resulting in considerable computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose MEDAL, a model-agnostic framework designed to post-process medical hallucinations. MEDAL can seamlessly integrate with any medical summarization model, requiring no additional computational overhead. MEDAL comprises a medical infilling model and a hallucination correction model. The infilling model generates non-factual summaries with common errors to train the correction model. The correction model is incorporated with a self-examination mechanism to activate its cognitive capability. We conduct comprehensive experiments using 11 widely accepted metrics on 7 baseline models across 3 medical text summarization tasks. MEDAL demonstrates superior performance in correcting hallucinations when applied to summaries generated by pre-trained language models and large language models.",
    "Better Synthetic Data by Retrieving and Transforming Existing Datasets": "Despite recent advances in large language models, building dependable and deployable NLP models typically requires abundant, high-quality training data. However, task-specific data is not available for many use cases, and manually curating task-specific data is labor-intensive. Recent work has studied prompt-driven synthetic data generation using large language models, but these generated datasets tend to lack complexity and diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce a method, DataTune, to make better use of existing, publicly available datasets to improve automatic dataset generation. DataTune performs dataset transformation, enabling the repurposing of publicly available datasets into a format that is directly aligned with the specific requirements of target tasks. On a diverse set of language-based tasks from the BIG-Bench benchmark, we find that finetuning language models via DataTune improves over a few-shot prompting baseline by 49% and improves over existing methods that use synthetic or retrieved training data by 34%. We find that dataset transformation significantly increases the diversity and difficulty of generated data on many tasks. We integrate DataTune into an open-source repository to make this method accessible to the community.",
    "Beyond Abstracts: A New Dataset, Prompt Design Strategy and Method for Biomedical Synthesis Generation": "The biomedical field relies on cost and time intensive systematic reviews of papers to enable practitioners to keep up to date with research. Impressive recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made the task of automating at least part of the systematic review process feasible, but progress is slow. This paper identifies some factors that may have been holding research back, and proposes a new, enhanced dataset and prompting-based method for automatic synthesis generation, the most challenging step for automation. We test different models and types of information from and about biomedical studies for their usefulness in obtaining high-quality results. We find that, surprisingly, inclusion of paper abstracts can worsen results. Instead, study summary information, and system instructions informed by domain knowledge, are key to producing high-quality syntheses.",
    "Beyond Binary Gender Labels: Revealing Gender Biases in LLMs through Gender-Neutral Name Predictions": "Name-based gender prediction has traditionally categorized individuals as either female or male based on their names, using a binary classification system. That binary approach can be problematic in the cases of gender-neutral names that do not align with any one gender, among other reasons. Relying solely on binary gender categories without recognizing gender-neutral names can reduce the inclusiveness of gender prediction tasks. We introduce an additional gender category, i.e., “neutral”, to study and address potential gender biases in Large Language Models (LLMs). We evaluate the performance of several foundational and large language models in predicting gender based on first names only. Additionally, we investigate the impact of adding birth years to enhance the accuracy of gender prediction, accounting for shifting associations between names and genders over time. Our findings indicate that most LLMs identify male and female names with high accuracy (over 80%) but struggle with gender-neutral names (under 40%), and the accuracy of gender prediction is higher for English-based first names than non-English names. The experimental results show that incorporating the birth year does not improve the overall accuracy of gender prediction, especially for names with evolving gender associations. We recommend using caution when applying LLMs for gender identification in downstream tasks, particularly when dealing with non-binary gender labels.",
    "Beyond Memorization: The Challenge of Random Memory Access in Language Models": "Recent developments in Language Models (LMs) have shown their effectiveness in NLP tasks, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, the mechanisms underlying knowledge storage and memory access within their parameters remain elusive. In this paper, we investigate whether a generative LM (e.g., GPT-2) is able to access its memory sequentially or randomly. Through carefully-designed synthetic tasks, covering the scenarios of full recitation, selective recitation and grounded question answering, we reveal that LMs manage to sequentially access their memory while encountering challenges in randomly accessing memorized content. We find that techniques including recitation and permutation improve the random memory access capability of LMs. Furthermore, by applying this intervention to realistic scenarios of open-domain question answering, we validate that enhancing random access by recitation leads to notable improvements in question answering. The code to reproduce our experiments can be found at https://github.com/sail-sg/lm-random-memory-access.",
    "Beyond One-Preference-Fits-All Alignment: Multi-Objective Direct Preference Optimization": "A single language model, even when aligned with labelers through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), may not suit all human preferences. Recent approaches therefore prefer customization, gathering multi-dimensional feedback, and creating distinct reward models for each dimension. Different language models are then optimized for various preferences using multi-objective RLHF (MORLHF) with varying reward weights. However, RL fine-tuning is unstable and resource-heavy, especially with diverse and usually conflicting objectives. In this paper, we present Multi-Objective Direct Preference Optimization (MODPO), an RL-free extension of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for multiple alignment objectives. Essentially, MODPO folds language modeling directly into reward modeling, training language models as implicit collective reward models that combine all objectives with specific weights. MODPO theoretically yields the same optimal solutions as MORLHF but is practically more stable and efficient. Empirical results in safety alignment and long-form question answering show that MODPO matches or outperforms existing methods, producing a Pareto front of language models catering to diverse preferences with three times less computational resources compared to MORLHF.",
    "Beyond Probabilities: Unveiling the Misalignment in Evaluating Large Language Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, fundamentally reshaping the landscape of natural language processing (NLP) research. However, recent evaluation frameworks often rely on the output probabilities of LLMs for predictions, primarily due to computational constraints, diverging from real-world LLM usage scenarios. While widely employed, the efficacy of these probability-based evaluation strategies remains an open research question. This study aims to scrutinize the validity of such probability-based evaluation methods within the context of using LLMs for Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), highlighting their inherent limitations. Our empirical investigation reveals that the prevalent probability-based evaluation method inadequately aligns with generation-based prediction. Furthermore, current evaluation frameworks typically assess LLMs through predictive tasks based on output probabilities rather than directly generating responses, owing to computational limitations. We illustrate that these probability-based approaches do not effectively correspond with generative predictions. The outcomes of our study can enhance the understanding of LLM evaluation methodologies and provide insights for future research in this domain.",
    "Beyond Retrieval: Topic-based Alignment of Scientific Papers to Research Proposal": "The inception of a research agenda typically commences with the creation of a comprehensive research proposal. The efficacy of the proposal often hinges on its ability to connect with the existing scientific literature that supports its ideas. To effectively assess the relevance of existing articles to a research proposal, it is imperative to categorize these articles into high-level thematic groups, referred to as topics, that align with the proposal. This paper introduces a novel task of aligning scientific articles, relevant to a proposal, with researcher-provided proposal topics. Additionally, we construct a dataset to serve as a benchmark for this task. We establish human and Large Language Model (LLM) baselines and propose a novel three-stage approach to address this challenge. We synthesize and use pseudo-labels that map proposal topics to text spans from cited articles to train Language Models (LMs) for two purposes: (i) as a retriever, to extract relevant text spans from cited articles for each topic, and (ii) as a classifier, to categorize the articles into the proposal topics. Our retriever-classifier pipeline, which employs very small open-source LMs fine-tuned with our constructed dataset, achieves results comparable to a vanilla paid LLM-based classifier, demonstrating its efficacy. However, a notable gap of 23.57 F1 score between our approach and the human baseline highlights the complexity of this task and emphasizes the need for further research.",
    "Beyond Scaling: Predicting Patent Approval with Domain-specific Fine-grained Claim Dependency Graph": "Model scaling is becoming the default choice for many language tasks due to the success of large language models (LLMs). However, it can fall short in specific scenarios where simple customized methods excel. In this paper, we delve into the patent approval prediction task and unveil that simple domain-specific graph methods outperform enlarging the model, using the intrinsic dependencies within the patent data. Specifically, we first extend the embedding-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) by scaling up its backbone model with various sizes of open-source LLMs, then explore prompt-based methods to harness proprietary LLMs' potential, but find the best results close to random guessing, underlining the ineffectiveness of model scaling-up. Hence, we propose a novel Fine-grained cLAim depeNdency (FLAN) Graph through meticulous patent data analyses, capturing the inherent dependencies across segments of the patent text. As it is model-agnostic, we apply cost-effective graph models to our FLAN Graph to obtain representations for approval prediction. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses prove that incorporating FLAN Graph via various graph models consistently outperforms all LLM baselines significantly. We hope that our observations and analyses in this paper can bring more attention to this challenging task and prompt further research into the limitations of LLMs. Our source code and dataset can be obtained from https://github.com/ShangDataLab/FLAN-Graph.",
    "Beyond Text: Unveiling Multimodal Proficiency of Large Language Models with MultiAPI Benchmark": "The proliferation of Large Language Models like ChatGPT has significantly advanced language understanding and generation, impacting a broad spectrum of applications. However, these models predominantly excel in text-based tasks, overlooking the complexity of real-world multimodal information. This study introduces MultiAPI, a pioneering comprehensive large-scale API benchmark dataset aimed at expanding LLMs' proficiency in multimodal contexts. Developed collaboratively through ChatGPT, MultiAPI consists of 187 diverse API calls and 1,799 contextual prompts, offering a unique platform for evaluating tool-augmented LLMs handling multimodal tasks. Through comprehensive experiments, our findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate proficiency in API call decision-making, they face challenges in domain identification, function selection, and argument generation. What's more, we surprisingly notice that auxiliary context can actually impair the performance. An in-depth error analysis paves the way for a new paradigm to address these challenges, suggesting a potential direction for future LLM research.",
    "Beyond Traditional Benchmarks: Analyzing Behaviors of Open LLMs on Data-to-Text Generation": "We analyze the behaviors of open large language models (LLMs) on the task of data-to-text (D2T) generation, i.e., generating coherent and relevant text from structured data. To avoid the issue of LLM training data contamination with standard benchmarks, we design QUINTD - a tool for collecting novel structured data records from public APIs. We find that open LLMs (Llama 2, Mistral, and Zephyr) can generate fluent and coherent texts in zero-shot settings from data in common formats collected with QUINTD. However, we show that the semantic accuracy of the outputs is a major issue: both according to human annotators and our reference-free metric based on GPT-4, more than 80% of the outputs of open LLMs contain at least one semantic error. We publicly release the code, data, and model outputs.",
    "Bi-Chainer: Automated Large Language Models Reasoning with Bidirectional Chaining": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown human-like reasoning abilities but still face challenges in solving complex logical problems. Existing unidirectional chaining methods, such as forward chaining and backward chaining, suffer from issues like low prediction accuracy and efficiency. To address these, we propose a bidirectional chaining method, Bi-Chainer, which dynamically switches to depth-first reasoning in the opposite reasoning direction when it encounters multiple branching options within the current direction. Thus, the intermediate reasoning results can be utilized as guidance to facilitate the reasoning process. We show that Bi-Chainer achieves sizable accuracy boosts over unidirectional chaining frameworks on four challenging logical reasoning datasets. Moreover, Bi-Chainer enhances the accuracy of intermediate proof steps and reduces the average number of inference calls, resulting in more efficient and accurate reasoning.",
    "Bi-Directional Multi-Granularity Generation Framework for Knowledge Graph-to-Text with Large Language Model": "The knowledge graph-to-text (KG-to-text) generation task aims to synthesize coherent and engaging sentences that accurately convey the complex information derived from an input knowledge graph. Existing methods generate the whole target text based on all KG triples at once and may incorporate incorrect KG triples for each sentence. To this end, we propose the bi-directional multi-granularity generation framework. Instead of generating the whole text at a time, we construct the sentence-level generation based on the corresponding triples and generate the graph-level text as a result. Moreover, we design a backward relation-extraction task to enhance the correctness of relational information. Our method achieves the new state-of-the-art in benchmark dataset WebNLG and further analysis shows the efficiency of different modules.",
    "Bias Bluff Busters at FIGNEWS 2024 Shared Task: Enhancing Bias Detection through Annotator Awareness and AI Integration": "This paper details our participation in the FIGNEWS-2024 shared task on bias and propaganda annotation in Gaza conflict news. Our objectives were to develop robust guidelines and annotate a substantial dataset to enhance bias detection. We focused on creating guidelines that prompt annotators to be aware of their biases and emphasise the need for a diverse annotator pool, to ensure that high inter-annotator agreement (IAA) reflects genuine consensus rather than homogeneity. We iteratively refined our guidelines and included detailed examples for clarity. We also explored the integration of ChatGPT as an annotator to support consistency. Our findings include the challenges in eliciting annotation consistency without embedding bias in the guidelines themselves and the importance of fostering annotator awareness of their own biases. This work provides insights into the complexities of subjective bias annotation and offers well-crafted guidelines for the field.",
    "Bias in News Summarization: Measures, Pitfalls and Corpora": "Summarization is an important application of large language models (LLMs). Most previous evaluation of summarization models has focused on their content selection, faithfulness, grammaticality and coherence. However, it is well known that LLMs can reproduce and reinforce harmful social biases. This raises the question: Do biases affect model outputs in a constrained setting like summarization? To help answer this question, we first motivate and introduce a number of definitions for biased behaviours in summarization models, along with practical operationalizations. Since we find that biases inherent to input documents can confound bias analysis in summaries, we propose a method to generate input documents with carefully controlled demographic attributes. This allows us to study summarizer behavior in a controlled setting, while still working with realistic input documents. We measure gender bias in English summaries generated by both purpose-built summarization models and general purpose chat models as a case study. We find content selection in single document summarization to be largely unaffected by gender bias, while hallucinations exhibit evidence of bias. To demonstrate the generality of our approach, we additionally investigate racial bias, including intersectional settings.",
    "BiasDPO: Mitigating Bias in Language Models through Direct Preference Optimization": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in advancing natural language processing, yet their potential to perpetuate biases poses significant concerns. This paper introduces a new framework employing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate gender, racial, and religious biases in LLM-generated English text. By developing a loss function that favors less biased over biased completions, our approach cultivates a preference for respectful and non-discriminatory language in LLMs. We also contribute a manually designed dataset for training LLMs to recognize and correct biases. This dataset encompasses a diverse range of prompts paired with both biased and unbiased completions. Implementing this approach on the Microsoft Phi-2 model, we demonstrate substantial reductions in biased outputs as our model outperforms the baseline model on almost all bias benchmarks. Our model also achieves better performance compared to other open-source models on most benchmarks. By reducing biases in the language generated by the model, our study marks a significant step towards developing more ethical and socially responsible LLMs. We publicly release BiasDPO dataset on HuggingFace.",
    "BIDER: Bridging Knowledge Inconsistency for Efficient Retrieval-Augmented LLMs via Key Supporting Evidence": "Retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated efficacy in knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain QA, addressing inherent challenges in knowledge update and factual inadequacy. However, inconsistencies between retrieval knowledge and the necessary knowledge for LLMs, leading to a decline in LLM's answer quality. This paper introduces BIDER, an approach that refines retrieval documents into Key Supporting Evidence (KSE) through knowledge synthesis, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference alignment. We train BIDER by learning from crafting KSE, while maximizing its output to align with LLM's information acquisition preferences through reinforcement learning. Evaluations across five datasets show BIDER boosts LLMs' answer quality by 7% while reducing input content length in retrieval documents by 80%, outperforming existing methods. The proposed KSE simulation effectively equips LLMs with essential information for accurate question answering.",
    "BioLay_AK_SS at BioLaySumm: Domain Adaptation by Two-Stage Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models used for Biomedical Lay Summary Generation": "Lay summarization is essential but challenging, as it simplifies scientific information for non-experts and keeps them updated with the latest scientific knowledge. In our participation in the Shared Task: Lay Summarization of Biomedical Research Articles @ BioNLP Workshop (Goldsack et al., 2024), ACL 2024, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation on abstractive summarization of biomedical literature using Large Language Models (LLMs) and assessed the performance using ten metrics across three categories: relevance, readability, and factuality, using eLife and PLOS datasets provided by the organizers. We developed a two-stage framework for lay summarization of biomedical scientific articles. In the first stage, we generated summaries using BART and PEGASUS LLMs by fine-tuning them on the given datasets. In the second stage, we combined the generated summaries and input them to BioBART, and then fine-tuned it on the same datasets. Our findings show that combining general and domain-specific LLMs enhances performance.",
    "BioMistral: A Collection of Open-Source Pretrained Large Language Models for Medical Domains": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility in recent years, offering potential applications across specialized domains such as healthcare and medicine. Despite the availability of various open-source LLMs tailored for health contexts, adapting general-purpose LLMs to the medical domain presents significant challenges. In this paper, we introduce BioMistral, an open-source LLM tailored for the biomedical domain, utilizing Mistral as its foundation model and further pre-trained on PubMed Central. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of BioMistral on a benchmark comprising 10 established medical question-answering (QA) tasks in English. We also explore lightweight models obtained through quantization and model merging approaches. Our results demonstrate BioMistral's superior performance compared to existing open-source medical models and its competitive edge against proprietary counterparts. Finally, to address the limited availability of data beyond English and to assess the multilingual generalization of medical LLMs, we automatically translated and evaluated this benchmark into 7 other languages. This marks the first large-scale multilingual evaluation of LLMs in the medical domain. Datasets, multilingual evaluation benchmarks, scripts, and all the models obtained during our experiments are freely released.",
    "BioT5+: Towards Generalized Biological Understanding with IUPAC Integration and Multi-task Tuning": "Recent research trends in computational biology have increasingly focused on integrating text and bio-entity modeling, especially in the context of molecules and proteins. However, previous efforts like BioT5 faced challenges in generalizing across diverse tasks and lacked a nuanced understanding of molecular structures, particularly in their textual representations (e.g., IUPAC). This paper introduces BioT5+, an extension of the BioT5 framework, tailored to enhance biological research and drug discovery. BioT5+ incorporates several novel features: integration of IUPAC names for molecular understanding, inclusion of extensive bio-text and molecule data from sources like bioRxiv and PubChem, the multi-task instruction tuning for generality across tasks, and a numerical tokenization technique for improved processing of numerical data. These enhancements allow BioT5+ to bridge the gap between molecular representations and their textual descriptions, providing a more holistic understanding of biological entities, and largely improving the grounded reasoning of bio-text and bio-sequences. The model is pre-trained and fine-tuned with a large number of experiments, including 3 types of problems (classification, regression, generation), 15 kinds of tasks, and 21 total benchmark datasets, demonstrating the remarkable performance and state-of-the-art results in most cases. BioT5+ stands out for its ability to capture intricate relationships in biological data, thereby contributing significantly to bioinformatics and computational biology. Our code is available at https://github.com/QizhiPei/BioT5.",
    "BIPED: Pedagogically Informed Tutoring System for ESL Education": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have a great potential to serve as readily available and cost-efficient Conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems (CITS) for teaching L2 learners of English. Existing CITS, however, are designed to teach only simple concepts or lack the pedagog-ical depth necessary to address diverse learning strategies. To develop a more pedagogically informed CITS capable of teaching complex concepts, we construct a BIlingual PEDagogically-informed Tutoring Dataset (BIPED) of one-on-one, human-to-human English tutoring interactions. Through post-hoc analysis of the tutoring interactions, we come up with a lexicon of dialogue acts (34 tutor acts and 9 student acts), which we use to further annotate the collected dataset. Based on a two-step framework of first predicting the appropriate tutor act then generating the corresponding response, we implemented two CITS models using GPT-4 and SOLAR-KO, respectively. We experimentally demonstrate that the implemented models not only replicate the style of human teachers but also employ diverse and contextually appropriate pedagogical strategies.",
    "BitDistiller: Unleashing the Potential of Sub-4-Bit LLMs via Self-Distillation": "The upscaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has yielded impressive advances in natural language processing, yet it also poses significant deployment challenges. Weight quantization has emerged as a widely embraced solution to reduce memory and computational demands. This paper introduces BitDistiller, a framework that synergizes Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with Knowledge Distillation (KD) to boost the performance of LLMs at ultra-low precisions (sub-4-bit). Specifically, BitDistiller first incorporates a tailored asymmetric quantization and clipping technique to maximally preserve the fidelity of quantized weights, and then proposes a novel Confidence-Aware Kullback-Leibler Divergence (CAKLD) objective, which is employed in a self-distillation manner to enable faster convergence and superior model performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that BitDistiller significantly surpasses existing methods in both 3-bit and 2-bit configurations on general language understanding and complex reasoning benchmarks. Notably, BitDistiller is shown to be more cost-effective, demanding fewer data and training resources.",
    "BizBench: A Quantitative Reasoning Benchmark for Business and Finance": "Answering questions within business and finance requires reasoning, precision, and a wide-breadth of technical knowledge. Together, these requirements make this domain difficult for large language models (LLMs). We introduce BizBench, a benchmark for evaluating models' ability to reason about realistic financial problems. BizBench comprises eight quantitative reasoning tasks, focusing on question-answering (QA) over financial data via program synthesis. We include three financially-themed code-generation tasks from newly collected and augmented QA data. Additionally, we isolate the reasoning capabilities required for financial QA: reading comprehension of financial text and tables for extracting intermediate values, and understanding financial concepts and formulas needed to calculate complex solutions. Collectively, these tasks evaluate a model's financial background knowledge, ability to parse financial documents, and capacity to solve problems with code. We conduct an in-depth evaluation of open-source and commercial LLMs, comparing and contrasting the behavior of code-focused and language-focused models. We demonstrate that the current bottleneck in performance is due to LLMs' limited business and financial understanding, highlighting the value of a challenging benchmark for quantitative reasoning within this domain.",
    "Black-Box Prompt Optimization: Aligning Large Language Models without Model Training": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive success in various applications. However, these models are often not well aligned with human intents, which calls for additional treatments on them; that is, the alignment problem. To make LLMs better follow user instructions, existing alignment methods primarily focus on further training them. However, the extra training of LLMs is usually expensive in terms of GPU computing; even worse, some LLMs are not accessible for user-demanded training, such as GPTs. In this work, we take a different perspective—Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO)—to perform alignments. The idea is to optimize user prompts to suit LLMs' input understanding, so as to best realize users' intents without updating LLMs' parameters. BPO leverages human preferences to optimize prompts, thus making it superior to LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) as a prompt engineer. Moreover, BPO is model-agnostic, and the empirical results demonstrate that the BPO-aligned ChatGPT yields a 22% increase in the win rate against its original version and 10% for GPT-4. Notably, the BPO-aligned LLMs can outperform the same models aligned by PPO and DPO, and it also brings additional performance gains when combining BPO with PPO or DPO. Code and datasets are released at https://github.com/thu-coai/BPO.",
    "Blending LLMs into Cascaded Speech Translation: KIT's Offline Speech Translation System for IWSLT 2024": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are currently under exploration for various tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Machine Translation (MT), and even End-to-End Speech Translation (ST). In this paper, we present KIT's offline submission in the constrained + LLM track by incorporating recently proposed techniques that can be added to any cascaded speech translation. Specifically, we integrate Mistral-7B1 into our system to enhance it in two ways. Firstly, we refine the ASR outputs by utilizing the N-best lists generated by our system and fine-tuning the LLM to predict the transcript accurately. Secondly, we refine the MT outputs at the document level by fine-tuning the LLM, leveraging both ASR and MT predictions to improve translation quality. We find that integrating the LLM into the ASR and MT systems results in an absolute improvement of 0.3% in Word Error Rate and 0.65% in COMET for tst2019 test set. In challenging test sets with overlapping speakers and background noise, we find that integrating LLM is not beneficial due to poor ASR performance. Here, we use ASR with chunked long-form decoding to improve context usage that may be unavailable when transcribing with Voice Activity Detection segmentation alone.",
    "BLENDSQL: A Scalable Dialect for Unifying Hybrid Question Answering in Relational Algebra": "Many existing end-to-end systems for hybrid question answering tasks can be boiled down to a “prompt-and-pray” paradigm, where the user has limited control and insight into the intermediate reasoning steps used to achieve the final result. Additionally, due to the context size limitation of many transformer-based LLMs, it is often not reasonable to expect that the full structured and unstructured context will fit into a given prompt in a zero-shot setting, let alone a few-shot setting. We introduce BLENDSQL, a superset of SQLite to act as a unified dialect for orchestrating reasoning across both unstructured and structured data. For hybrid question answering tasks involving multi-hop reasoning, we encode the full decomposed reasoning roadmap into a single interpretable BLENDSQL query. Notably, we show that BLENDSQL can scale to massive datasets and improve the performance of end-to-end systems while using 35% fewer prompt tokens. Our code is available and installable as a package at github.com/parkervg/blendsql.",
    "Blinded by Generated Contexts: How Language Models Merge Generated and Retrieved Contexts When Knowledge Conflicts?": "While auxiliary information has become a key to enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), relatively little is known about how LLMs merge these contexts, specifically contexts generated by LLMs and those retrieved from external sources. To investigate this, we formulate a systematic framework to identify whether LLMs' responses are attributed to either generated or retrieved contexts. To easily trace the origin of the response, we construct datasets with conflicting contexts, i.e., each question is paired with both generated and retrieved contexts, yet only one of them contains the correct answer. Our experiments reveal a significant bias in several LLMs (GPT-4/3.5 and Llama2) to favor generated contexts, even when they provide incorrect information. We further identify two key factors contributing to this bias: i) contexts generated by LLMs typically show greater similarity to the questions, increasing their likelihood of being selected; ii) the segmentation process used in retrieved contexts disrupts their completeness, thereby hindering their full utilization in LLMs. Our analysis enhances the understanding of how LLMs merge diverse contexts, offers valuable insights for advancing current LLM augmentation methods, and highlights the risk of generated misinformation for retrieval-augmented LLMs.",
    "BloomVQA: Assessing Hierarchical Multi-modal Comprehension": "We propose a novel VQA dataset, BloomVQA, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation of large vision-language models on comprehension tasks. Unlike current benchmarks that often focus on fact-based memorization and simple reasoning tasks without theoretical grounding, we collect multiple-choice samples based on picture stories that reflect different levels of comprehension, as laid out in Bloom's Taxonomy, a classic framework for learning assessment widely adopted in education research. Our data maps to a novel hierarchical graph representation which enables automatic data augmentation and novel measures characterizing model consistency. We perform graded evaluation and reliability analysis on recent multi-modal models. In comparison to low-level tasks, we observe decreased performance on tasks requiring advanced comprehension and cognitive skills with up to 38.0% drop in VQA accuracy. In comparison to earlier models, GPT-4V demonstrates improved accuracy over all comprehension levels and shows a tendency of bypassing visual inputs especially for higher-level tasks. Current models also show consistency patterns misaligned with human comprehension in various scenarios, demonstrating the need for improvement based on theoretically-grounded criteria.",
    "Book2Dial: Generating Teacher-Student Interactions from Textbooks for Cost-Effective Development of Educational Chatbots": "Educational chatbots are a promising tool for assisting student learning. However, developing effective chatbots in education has been challenging, as high-quality data is seldom available in this domain. In this paper, we propose a framework for generating synthetic teacher-student interactions grounded in a set of textbooks. Our approaches capture one aspect of learning interactions where curious students with partial knowledge interactively ask a teacher questions about the material in the textbook. We highlight various quality criteria such dialogues should fulfill and compare several approaches relying on either prompting or fine-tuning large language models. We use synthetic dialogues to train educational chatbots and show the benefits of further fine-tuning in different educational domains. However, human evaluation shows that our best data synthesis method still suffers from hallucinations and tends to reiterate information from previous conversations. Our findings offer insights for future efforts in synthesizing conversational data that strikes a balance between size and quality.",
    "Boosting Language Models Reasoning with Chain-of-Knowledge Prompting": "Recently, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has delivered success on complex reasoning tasks, which aims at designing a simple prompt like “Let's think step by step” or multiple in-context exemplars with well-designed rationales to elicit Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate intermediate reasoning steps. However, the generated rationales often come with hallucinations, making unfactual and unfaithful reasoning chains. To mitigate this brittleness, we propose a novel Chain-of-Knowledge (CoK) prompting, where we aim at eliciting LLMs to generate explicit pieces of knowledge evidence in the form of structure triple. This is inspired by our human behaviors, i.e., we can draw a mind map or knowledge map as the reasoning evidence in the brain before answering a complex question. Benefiting from CoK, we additionally introduce a F2-Verification method to estimate the reliability of the reasoning chains in terms of factuality and faithfulness. For the unreliable response, the wrong evidence can be indicated to prompt the LLM to rethink. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can further improve the performance of commonsense, factual, symbolic, and arithmetic reasoning tasks.",
    "Boosting LLM Agents with Recursive Contemplation for Effective Deception Handling": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant success in using LLMs as agents. Nevertheless, a common assumption that LLMs always process honest information neglects the widespread deceptive or misleading content in human and AI-generated material. This oversight might expose LLMs to malicious manipulations. To enhance LLMs' ability to identify and counteract deceptive information, in this paper, inspired by humans' recursive thinking and perspective-taking, we introduce a novel cognitive framework, Recursive Contemplation (ReCon). ReCon combines formulation and refinement contemplation processes; formulation contemplation produces initial thoughts and speech, while refinement contemplation further polishes them. Additionally, we incorporate first-order and second-order perspective transitions into these processes respectively. Specifically, the first-order allows an LLM agent to infer others' mental states, and the second-order involves understanding how others perceive the agent's mental state. After integrating ReCon with various LLMs, extensive experiment results from the Avalon game and BigTom benchmark indicate ReCon's efficacy in aiding LLMs to discern and maneuver around deceptive information without extra fine-tuning and data. Finally, we demonstrate ReCon's scaling trend with model parameters, and explore the current limitations of LLMs in terms of safety and reasoning, potentially furnishing insights for subsequent research.",
    "Boosting Zero-Shot Crosslingual Performance using LLM-Based Augmentations with Effective Data Selection": "Large language models (LLMs) are very proficient text generators. We leverage this capability of LLMs to generate task-specific data via zero-shot prompting and promote cross-lingual transfer for low-resource target languages. Given task-specific data in a source language and a teacher model trained on this data, we propose using this teacher to label LLM generations and employ a set of simple data selection strategies that use the teacher's label probabilities. Our data selection strategies help us identify a representative subset of diverse generations that help boost zero-shot accuracies while being efficient, in comparison to using all the LLM generations (without any subset selection). We also highlight other important design choices that affect cross-lingual performance such as the use of translations of source data and what labels are best to use for the LLM generations. We observe significant performance gains across sentiment analysis and natural language inference tasks (of up to a maximum of 7.13 absolute points and 1.5 absolute points on average) across a number of target languages (Hindi, Marathi, Urdu, Swahili) and domains.",
    "Bootstrapped Pre-training with Dynamic Identifier Prediction for Generative Retrieval": "Generative retrieval uses differentiable search indexes to directly generate relevant document identifiers in response to a query. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of a strong generative retrieval model, trained with carefully crafted pre-training tasks, to enhance downstream retrieval tasks via fine-tuning. However, the full power of pre-training for generative retrieval remains underexploited due to its reliance on pre-defined static document identifiers, which may not align with evolving model parameters. In this work, we introduce BootRet, a bootstrapped pre-training method for generative retrieval that dynamically adjusts document identifiers during pre-training to accommodate the continuing memorization of the corpus. BootRet involves three key training phases: (i) initial identifier generation, (ii) pre-training via corpus indexing and relevance prediction tasks, and (iii) bootstrapping for identifier updates. To facilitate the pre-training phase, we further introduce noisy documents and pseudo-queries, generated by large language models, to resemble semantic connections in both indexing and retrieval tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that BootRet significantly outperforms existing pre-training generative retrieval baselines and performs well even in zero-shot settings.",
    "Bootstrapping LLM-based Task-Oriented Dialogue Agents via Self-Talk": "Large language models (LLMs) are powerful dialogue agents, but specializing them towards fulfilling a specific function can be challenging. Instructing tuning, i.e. tuning models on instruction and sample responses generated by humans (Ouyang et al., 2022), has proven as an effective method to do so, yet requires a number of data samples that a) might not be available or b) costly to generate. Furthermore, this cost increases when the goal is to make the LLM follow a specific workflow within a dialogue instead of single instructions. Inspired by the self-play technique in reinforcement learning and the use of LLMs to simulate human agents, we propose a more effective method for data collection through LLMs engaging in a conversation in various roles. This approach generates a training data via self-talk of LLMs that can be refined and utilized for supervised fine-tuning. We introduce an automated way to measure the (partial) success of a dialogue. This metric is used to filter the generated conversational data that is fed back in LLM for training. Based on our automated and human evaluations of conversation quality, we demonstrate that such self-talk data improves results. In addition, we examine the various characteristics that showcase the quality of generated dialogues and how they can be connected to their potential utility as training data.",
    "Born Differently Makes a Difference: Counterfactual Study of Bias in Biography Generation from a Data-to-Text Perspective": "How do personal attributes affect biography generation? Addressing this question requires an identical pair of biographies where only the personal attributes of interest are different. However, it is rare in the real world. To address this, we propose a counterfactual methodology from a data-to-text perspective, manipulating the personal attributes of interest while keeping the co-occurring attributes unchanged. We first validate that the fine-tuned Flan-T5 model generates the biographies based on the given attributes. This work expands the analysis of gender-centered bias in text generation. Our results confirm the well-known bias in gender and also show the bias in regions, in both individual and its related co-occurring attributes in semantic matching and sentiment.",
    "Both Matter: Enhancing the Emotional Intelligence of Large Language Models without Compromising the General Intelligence": "Emotional Intelligence (EI), consisting of emotion perception, emotion cognition and emotion expression, plays the critical roles in improving user interaction experience for the current large language model (LLM) based conversational general AI assistants. Previous works mainly focus on raising the emotion perception ability of them via naive fine-tuning on EI-related classification or regression tasks. However, this leads to the incomplete enhancement of EI and catastrophic forgetting of the general intelligence (GI). To this end, we first introduce EIBENCH, a large-scale collection of EI-related tasks in the text-to-text format with task instructions that covers all three aspects of EI, which lays a solid foundation for the comprehensive EI enhancement of LLMs. Then a novel Modular Emotional Intelligence enhancement method (MoEI), consisting of Modular Parameter Expansion and intra-inter modulation, is proposed to comprehensively enhance the EI of LLMs without compromise their GI. Extensive experiments on two representative LLM-based assistants, Flan-T5 and LLaMA-2-Chat, demonstrate the effectiveness of MoEI to improving EI while maintain GI.",
    "BrainStorm @ iREL at #SMM4H 2024: Leveraging Translation and Topical Embeddings for Annotation Detection in Tweets": "The proliferation of LLMs in various NLP tasks has sparked debates regarding their reliability, particularly in annotation tasks where biases and hallucinations may arise. In this shared task, we address the challenge of distinguishing annotations made by LLMs from those made by human domain experts in the context of COVID-19 symptom detection from tweets in Latin American Spanish. This paper presents BrainStorm @ iREL's approach to the SMM4H 2024 Shared Task, leveraging the inherent topical information in tweets, we propose a novel approach to identify and classify annotations, aiming to enhance the trustworthiness of annotated data.",
    "Bridging Distribution Gap via Semantic Rewriting with LLMs to Enhance OOD Robustness": "This paper investigates the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) against Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data within the context of sentiment analysis. Traditional fine-tuning approaches often fail to generalize effectively across different data distributions, limiting the practical deployment of LLMs in dynamic real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method called Semantic Rewriting, which leverages the inherent flexibility of LLMs to align both in-distribution (ID) and OOD data with the LLMs distributions. By semantically transforming sentences to minimize linguistic discrepancies, our approach helps to standardize features across datasets, thus enhancing model robustness. We conduct extensive experiments with several benchmark datasets and LLMs to validate the efficacy of our method. The results demonstrate that Semantic Rewriting significantly improves the performance of models on OOD tasks, outperforming traditional methods in both robustness and generalization capabilities. Our findings suggest that Semantic Rewriting is a promising technique for developing more reliable and versatile NLP systems capable of performing robustly across diverse operational environments.",
    "Bridging the Preference Gap between Retrievers and LLMs": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior results across a wide range of tasks, and Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is an effective way to enhance the performance by locating relevant information and placing it into the context window of the LLM. However, the relationship between retrievers and LLM in a RAG is still under-investigated. Most existing work treats the retriever and the LLM as independent components and leaves a gap between retrieving human-“friendly” information and assembling a LLM-“friendly” context. In this work, we examine a novel bridge mechanism. We validate the ranking and selection assumptions of retrievers in the context of RAG and propose a framework that chains together supervised and reinforcement learning to train a bridge model that optimizes the connection between the retriever and the LLM. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both question-answering and personalized generation tasks.",
    "Browse and Concentrate: Comprehending Multimodal Content via prior-LLM Context Fusion": "With the bloom of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that incorporate LLMs with pre-trained vision models have recently demonstrated impressive performance across diverse vision-language tasks. However, they fall short to comprehend context involving multiple images. A primary reason for this shortcoming is that the visual features for each images are encoded individually by frozen encoders before feeding into the LLM backbone, lacking awareness of other images and the multimodal instructions. We term this issue as prior-LLM modality isolation and propose a two phase paradigm, browse-and-concentrate1, to enable in-depth multimodal context fusion prior to feeding the features into LLMs. This paradigm initially “browses” through the inputs for essential insights, and then revisits the inputs to “concentrate” on crucial details, guided by these insights, to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the multimodal inputs. Additionally, we develop training strategies specifically to enhance the understanding of multi-image inputs. Our method markedly boosts the performance on 7 multi-image scenarios, contributing to increments on average accuracy by 2.13% and 7.60% against strong MLLMs baselines with 3B and 11B LLMs, respectively.",
    "Budget-Constrained Tool Learning with Planning": "Despite intensive efforts devoted to tool learning, the problem of budget-constrained tool learning, which focuses on resolving user queries within a specific budget constraint, has been widely overlooked. This paper proposes a novel method for budget-constrained tool learning. Our approach involves creating a preferable plan under the budget constraint before utilizing the tools. This plan outlines the feasible tools and the maximum number of times they can be employed, offering a comprehensive overview of the tool learning process for large language models. This allows them to allocate the budget from a broader perspective. To devise the plan without incurring significant extra costs, we suggest initially estimating the usefulness of the candidate tools based on past experience. Subsequently, we employ dynamic programming to formulate the plan. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be integrated with various tool learning methods, significantly enhancing their effectiveness under strict budget constraints.",
    "BvSP: Broad-view Soft Prompting for Few-Shot Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction": "Aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) aims to predict four aspect-based elements, including aspect term, opinion term, aspect category, and sentiment polarity. In practice, unseen aspects, due to distinct data distribution, impose many challenges for a trained neural model. Motivated by this, this work formulates ASQP into the few-shot scenario, which aims for fast adaptation in real applications. Therefore, we first construct a few-shot ASQP dataset (FSQP) that contains richer categories and is more balanced for the few-shot study. Moreover, recent methods extract quads through a generation paradigm, which involves converting the input sentence into a templated target sequence. However, they primarily focus on the utilization of a single template or the consideration of different template orders, thereby overlooking the correlations among various templates. To tackle this issue, we further propose a Broad-view Soft Prompting (BvSP) method that aggregates multiple templates with a broader view by taking into account the correlation between the different templates. Specifically, BvSP uses the pre-trained language model to select the most relevant k templates with Jensen-Shannon divergence. BvSP further introduces soft prompts to guide the pre-trained language model using the selected templates. Then, we aggregate the results of multi-templates by voting mechanism. Empirical results demonstrate that BvSP significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under four few-shot settings and other public datasets. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/byinhao/BvSP.",
    "Bypassing LLM Watermarks with Color-Aware Substitutions": "Watermarking approaches are proposed to identify if text being circulated is human- or large language model- (LLM) generated. The state-of-the-art watermarking strategy of Kirchenbauer et al. (2023a) biases the LLM to generate specific (“green”) tokens. However, determining the robustness of this watermarking method under finite (low) edit budgets is an open problem. Additionally, existing attack methods fail to evade detection for longer text segments. We overcome these limitations, and propose Self Color Testing-based Substitution (SCTS), the first “color-aware” attack. SCTS obtains color information by strategically prompting the watermarked LLM and comparing output tokens frequencies. It uses this information to determine token colors, and substitutes green tokens with non-green ones. In our experiments, SCTS successfully evades watermark detection using fewer number of edits than related work. Additionally, we show both theoretically and empirically that SCTS can remove the watermark for arbitrarily long watermarked text.",
    "Cache & Distil: Optimising API Calls to Large Language Models": "Large-scale deployment of generative AI tools often depends on costly API calls to a Large Language Model (LLM) to fulfil user queries, a process that also exposes the request stream to external providers. To curtail the frequency of these calls, one can employ a local smaller language model - a student - which is continuously trained on the responses of the LLM. This student gradually gains proficiency in independently handling an increasing number of user requests, a process we term neural caching. The crucial element in neural caching is a policy that decides which requests should be processed by the student alone and which should be redirected to the LLM, subsequently aiding the student's learning. In this study, we focus on classification tasks, and we consider a range of classic Active Learning-based selection criteria as the policy. Our experiments suggest that Margin Sampling and Query by Committee bring consistent benefits over other policies and baselines across tasks and budgets.",
    "Calibrating Large Language Models Using Their Generations Only": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in user-facing applications, building trust and maintaining safety by accurately quantifying a model's confidence in its prediction becomes even more important. However, finding effective ways to calibrate LLMs—especially when the only interface to the models is their generated text—remains a challenge. We propose APRICOT (Auxiliary prediction of confidence targets): A method to set confidence targets and train an additional model that predicts an LLM's confidence based on its textual input and output alone. This approach has several advantages: It is conceptually simple, does not require access to the target model beyond its output, does not interfere with the language generation, and has a multitude of potential usages, for instance by verbalizing the predicted confidence or adjusting the given answer based on the confidence. We show how our approach performs competitively in terms of calibration error for white-box and black-box LLMs on closed-book question-answering to detect incorrect LLM answers.",
    "Calibrating Positional Attention Bias Improves Long Context Utilization": "Large language models (LLMs), even when specifically trained to process long input contexts, struggle to capture relevant information located in the middle of their input. This phenomenon has been known as the lost-in-the-middle problem. In this work, we make three contributions. First, we set out to understand the factors that cause this phenomenon. In doing so, we establish a connection between lost-in-the-middle to LLMs' intrinsic attention bias: LLMs exhibit an U-shaped attention bias where the tokens at the beginning and at the end of its input receive higher attention, regardless of their relevance. Second, we mitigate this positional bias through a calibration mechanism, found-in-the-middle, that allows the model to attend to contexts faithfully according to their relevance, even though when they are in the middle. Third, we show found-in-the-middle not only achieves better performance in locating relevant information within a long context, but also eventually leads to improved retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) performance across various tasks, outperforming existing methods by up to 10 percentage points. These findings open up future directions in understanding LLM attention bias and its potential consequences.",
    "Call Me When Necessary: LLMs can Efficiently and Faithfully Reason over Structured Environments": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in reasoning over structured environments, e.g., knowledge graphs and tables. Such tasks typically require multi-hop reasoning, i.e., match natural language utterance with instances in the environment. Previous works adopt LLMs to incrementally build a reasoning path, where LLMs either invoke tools or pick up items by step-by-step interacting with the environment. We propose Reasoning-Path-Editing (Readi), a novel framework where LLMs can efficiently and faithfully reason over structured environments. In Readi, LLMs initially generate a reasoning path given a query, and edit the path only when necessary. We instantiate the path on structured environments and provide feedback to edit the path if anything goes wrong. Experimental results on three KGQA and two TableQA datasets show the effectiveness of Readi, significantly surpassing previous LLM-based methods (by 9.1% Hit@1 on WebQSP, 12.4% on MQA-3H and 9.5% on WTQ), comparable with state-of-the-art fine-tuned methods (67% on CWQ and 74.7% on WebQSP) and substantially boosting the vanilla LLMs (by 14.9% on CWQ). Our code will be available on https://aka.ms/readi.",
    "CaLM: Contrasting Large and Small Language Models to Verify Grounded Generation": "Grounded generation aims to equip language models (LMs) with the ability to produce more credible and accountable responses by accurately citing verifiable sources. However, existing methods, by either feeding LMs with raw or preprocessed materials, remain prone to errors. To address this, we introduce CaLM, a novel verification framework. CaLM leverages the insight that a robust grounded response should be consistent with information derived solely from its cited sources. Our framework empowers smaller LMs, which rely less on parametric memory and excel at processing relevant information given a query, to validate the output of larger LMs. Larger LM responses that closely align with the smaller LMs' output, which relies exclusively on cited documents, are verified. Responses showing discrepancies are iteratively refined through a feedback loop. Experiments on three open-domain question-answering datasets demonstrate significant performance gains of 1.5% to 7% absolute average without any required model fine-tuning.",
    "CaMML: Context-Aware Multimodal Learner for Large Models": "In this work, we introduce Context-Aware MultiModal Learner (CaMML), for tuning large multimodal models (LMMs). CaMML, a lightweight module, is crafted to seamlessly integrate multimodal contextual samples into large models, thereby empowering the model to derive knowledge from analogous, domain-specific, up-to-date information and make grounded inferences. Importantly, CaMML is highly scalable and can efficiently handle lengthy multimodal context examples owing to its hierarchical design. Based on CaMML, we have developed two multimodal models, CaMML-7B and CaMML-13B, that have shown exceptional performance across an array of benchmark datasets for multimodal tasks. Remarkably, CaMML-13B achieves the state-of-the-art performance on over ten widely recognized multimodal benchmark datasets, surpassing LLaVA-1.5 (13B) with a noticeable margin, without integration of any external resources. Moreover, we have conducted extensive ablative studies to inspect the inner workings of CaMML and performed qualitative analyses to showcase its effectiveness in handling real-world challenging cases. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/amazon-science/camml.",
    "Can ChatGPT's Performance be Improved on Verb Metaphors Detection Tasks? Bootstrapping and Combining Tacit Knowledge": "Metaphors detection, as an important task in the field of NLP, has been receiving sustained academic attention in recent years. Current researches focus on supervised metaphors detection systems, which usually require large-scale, high-quality labeled data support. The emergence of large language models (e.g., ChatGPT) has made many NLP tasks (e.g., automatic summarization and dialogue systems) a qualitative leap. However, it is worth noting that the use of ChatGPT for unsupervised metaphors detection is often challenged with less-than-expected performance. Therefore, the aim of our work is to explore how to bootstrap and combine ChatGPT by detecting the most prevalent verb metaphors among metaphors. Our approach first utilizes ChatGPT to obtain literal collocations of target verbs and subject-object pairs of verbs in the text to be detected. Subsequently, these literal collocations and subject-object pairs are mapped to the same set of topics, and finally, the verb metaphors are detected through the analysis of entailment relations. The experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance on the unsupervised verb metaphors detection task compared to existing unsupervised methods or direct prediction using ChatGPT. Our code is available at https://github.com/VILAN-Lab/Unsupervised-Metaphor-Detection.",
    "Can GPT Redefine Medical Understanding?": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on many tasks in different domains. However, their performance in contextual biomedical machine reading comprehension (MRC) has not been evaluated in depth. In this work, we evaluate GPT on four contextual biomedical MRC benchmarks. We experiment with different conventional prompting techniques as well as introduce our own novel prompting method. To solve some of the retrieval problems inherent to LLMs, we propose a prompting strategy named Implicit Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that alleviates the need for using vector databases to retrieve important chunks in traditional RAG setups. Moreover, we report qualitative assessments on the natural language generation outputs from our approach. The results show that our new prompting technique is able to get the best performance in two out of four datasets and ranks second in rest of them. Experiments show that modern-day LLMs like GPT even in a zero-shot setting can outperform supervised models, leading to new state-of-the-art (SoTA) results on two of the benchmarks.",
    "Can Language Models Serve as Text-Based World Simulators?": "Virtual environments play a key role in benchmarking advances in complex planning and decision-making tasks but are expensive and complicated to build by hand. Can current language models themselves serve as world simulators, correctly predicting how actions change different world states, thus bypassing the need for extensive manual coding? Our goal is to answer this question in the context of text-based simulators. Our approach is to build and use a new benchmark, called BYTE-SIZED32-State-Prediction, containing a dataset of text game state transitions and accompanying game tasks. We use this to directly quantify, for the first time, how well LLMs can serve as text-based world simulators. We test GPT-4 on this dataset and find that, despite its impressive performance, it is still an unreliable world simulator without further innovations. This work thus contributes both new insights into current LLM's capabilities and weaknesses, as well as a novel benchmark to track future progress as new models appear.",
    "Can Large Language Model Summarizers Adapt to Diverse Scientiﬁc Communication Goals?": "In this work, we investigate the controllability of large language models (LLMs) on scientific summarization tasks. We identify key stylistic and content coverage factors that characterize different types of summaries such as paper reviews, abstracts, and lay summaries. By controlling stylistic features, we find that non-fine-tuned LLMs outperform humans in the MuP review generation task, both in terms of similarity to reference summaries and human preferences. Also, we show that we can improve the controllability of LLMs with keyword-based classifier-free guidance (CFG) while achieving lexical overlap comparable to strong fine-tuned baselines on arXiv and PubMed. However, our results also indicate that LLMs cannot consistently generate long summaries with more than 8 sentences. Furthermore, these models exhibit limited capacity to produce highly abstractive lay summaries. Although LLMs demonstrate strong generic summarization competency, sophisticated content control without costly fine-tuning remains an open problem for domain-specific applications.",
    "Can Large Language Models be Good Emotional Supporter?": "Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) is a task aimed at alleviating individuals' emotional distress through daily conversation. Given its inherent complexity and non-intuitive nature, ESConv dataset incorporates support strategies to facilitate the generation of appropriate responses. Recently, despite the remarkable conversational ability of large language models (LLMs), previous studies have suggested that they often struggle with providing useful emotional support. Hence, this work initially analyzes the results of LLMs on ESConv, revealing challenges in selecting the correct strategy and a notable preference for a specific strategy. Motivated by these, we explore the impact of the inherent preference in LLMs on providing emotional support, and consequently, we observe that exhibiting high preference for specific strategies hinders effective emotional support, aggravating its robustness in predicting the appropriate strategy. Moreover, we conduct a methodological study to offer insights into the necessary approaches for LLMs to serve as proficient emotional supporters. Our findings emphasize that (1) low preference for specific strategies hinders the progress of emotional support, (2) external assistance helps reduce preference bias, and (3) existing LLMs alone cannot become good emotional supporters. These insights suggest promising avenues for future research to enhance the emotional intelligence of LLMs.",
    "Can Large Language Models Follow Concept Annotation Guidelines? A Case Study on Scientific and Financial Domains": "Although large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capacity to leverage in-context demonstrations, it is still unclear to what extent they can learn new facts or concept definitions via prompts. To address this question, we examine the capacity of instruction-tuned LLMs to follow in-context concept annotation guidelines for zero-shot sentence labeling tasks. We design guidelines that present different types of factual and counterfactual concept definitions, which are used as prompts for zero-shot sentence classification tasks. Our results show that although concept definitions consistently help in task performance, only the larger models (with 70B parameters or more) have limited ability to work under counterfactual contexts. Importantly, only proprietary models such as GPT-3.5 can recognize nonsensical guidelines, which we hypothesize is due to more sophisticated alignment methods. Finally, we find that FALCON-180B-CHAT is outperformed by LLAMA-2-70B-CHAT in most cases, which indicates that increasing model scale does not guarantee better adherence to guidelines. Altogether, our simple evaluation method reveals significant gaps in concept understanding between the most capable open-source language models and the leading proprietary APIs.",
    "Can Large Language Models Interpret Noun-Noun Compounds? A Linguistically-Motivated Study on Lexicalized and Novel Compounds": "Noun-noun compounds interpretation is the task where a model is given one of such constructions, and it is asked to provide a paraphrase, making the semantic relation between the nouns explicit, as in carrot cake is “a cake made of carrots.” Such a task requires the ability to understand the implicit structured representation of the compound meaning. In this paper, we test to what extent the recent Large Language Models can interpret the semantic relation between the constituents of lexicalized English compounds and whether they can abstract from such semantic knowledge to predict the semantic relation between the constituents of similar but novel compounds by relying on analogical comparisons (e.g., carrot dessert). We test both Surprisal metrics and prompt-based methods to see whether i.) they can correctly predict the relation between constituents, and ii.) the semantic representation of the relation is robust to paraphrasing. Using a dataset of lexicalized and annotated noun-noun compounds, we find that LLMs can infer some semantic relations better than others (with a preference for compounds involving concrete concepts). When challenged to perform abstractions and transfer their interpretations to semantically similar but novel compounds, LLMs show serious limitations.",
    "Can Large Language Models Mine Interpretable Financial Factors More Effectively? A Neural-Symbolic Factor Mining Agent Model": "Finding interpretable factors for stock returns is the most vital issue in the empirical asset pricing domain. As data-driven methods, existing factor mining models can be categorized into symbol-based and neural-based models. Symbol-based models are interpretable but inefficient, while neural-based approaches are efficient but lack interpretability. Hence, mining interpretable factors effectively presents a significant challenge. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various tasks, we propose a FActor Mining Agent (FAMA) model that enables LLMs to integrate the strengths of both neural and symbolic models for factor mining.  In this paper, FAMA consists of two main components: Cross-Sample Selection (CSS) and Chain-of-Experience (CoE). CSS addresses the homogeneity challenges in LLMs during factor mining by assimilating diverse factors as in-context samples, whereas CoE enables LLMs to leverage past successful mining experiences, expediting the mining of effective factors. Experimental evaluations on real-world stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by surpassing the SOTA RankIC by 0.006 and RankICIR by 0.105 in predicting S&P 500 returns. Furthermore, the investment simulation shows that our model can achieve superior performance with an annualized return of 38.4% and a Sharpe ratio of 667.2%.",
    "Can Large Multimodal Models Uncover Deep Semantics Behind Images?": "Understanding the deep semantics of images is essential in the era dominated by social media. However, current research works primarily on the superficial description of images, revealing a notable deficiency in the systematic investigation of the inherent deep semantics. In this work, we introduce DEEPEVAL, a comprehensive benchmark to assess Large Multimodal Models' (LMMs) capacities of visual deep semantics. DEEPEVAL includes human-annotated dataset and three progressive subtasks: fine-grained description selection, in-depth title matching, and deep semantics understanding. Utilizing DEEPEVAL, we evaluate 9 open-source LMMs and GPT-4V(ision). Our evaluation demonstrates a substantial gap between the deep semantic comprehension capabilities of existing LMMs and humans. For example, GPT-4V is 30% behind humans in understanding deep semantics, even though it achieves human-comparable performance in image description. Further analysis reveals that LMM performance on DEEPEVAL varies according to the specific facets of deep semantics explored, indicating the fundamental challenges remaining in developing LMMs.",
    "Can LLMs Augment Low-Resource Reading Comprehension Datasets?": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, demonstrating the ability to reason and apply common sense. A relevant application is to use them for creating high-quality synthetic datasets for downstream tasks. In this work, we probe whether GPT-4 can be used to augment existing extractive reading comprehension datasets. Automating data annotation processes has the potential to save large amounts of time, money, and effort that goes into manually labeling datasets. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of GPT-4 as a replacement for human annotators for low-resource reading comprehension tasks, by comparing performance after fine-tuning, and the cost associated with annotation. This work serves to be the first analysis of LLMs as synthetic data augmenters for QA systems, highlighting the unique opportunities and challenges. Additionally, we release augmented versions of low-resource datasets, that will allow the research community to create further benchmarks for evaluation of generated datasets.",
    "Can LLMs get help from other LLMs without revealing private information?": "Cascades are a common type of machine learning systems in which a large, remote model can be queried if a local model is not able to accurately label a user's data by itself. Serving stacks for large language models (LLMs) increasingly use cascades due to their ability to preserve task performance while dramatically reducing inference costs. However, applying cascade systems in situations where the local model has access to sensitive data constitutes a significant privacy risk for users since such data could be forwarded to the remote model. In this work, we show the feasibility of applying cascade systems in such setups by equipping the local model with privacy-preserving techniques that reduce the risk of leaking private information when querying the remote model.  To quantify information leakage in such setups, we introduce two privacy measures. We then propose a system that leverages the recently introduced social learning paradigm in which LLMs collaboratively learn from each other by exchanging natural language. Using this paradigm, we demonstrate on several datasets that our methods minimize the privacy loss while at the same time improving task performance compared to a non-cascade baseline.",
    "Can LLMs Learn from Previous Mistakes? Investigating LLMs' Errors to Boost for Reasoning": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated striking reasoning capability. Recent works have shown the benefits to LLMs from fine-tuning golden-standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales or using them as correct examples in few-shot prompting. While humans can indeed imitate correct examples, learning from our mistakes is another vital aspect of human cognition. Hence, a question naturally arises: can LLMs learn and benefit from their mistakes, especially for their reasoning? This study investigates this problem from both the prompting and model-tuning perspectives. We begin by introducing COTERRORSET, a new benchmark with 558,960 questions, each designed with both correct and error references, and demonstrating the types and reasons for making such mistakes. To explore the effectiveness of those mistakes, we design two methods: (1) Self-rethinking prompting guides LLMs to rethink whether they have made similar previous mistakes; and (2) Mistake tuning involves finetuning models in both correct and incorrect reasoning domains, rather than only tuning models to learn ground truth in traditional methodology. We conduct a series of experiments to prove LLMs can obtain benefits from mistakes in both directions. Our two methods offer potentially cost-effective strategies by leveraging errors to enhance reasoning capabilities, which costs significantly less than creating meticulously hand-crafted golden references. We ultimately make a thorough analysis of the reasons behind LLMs' errors, which provides directions that future research needs to overcome. COTERRORSET will be published soon on https://github.com/YookiTong/Learn-from-Mistakes-CotErrorSet.",
    "Can LLMs Reason with Rules? Logic Scaffolding for Stress-Testing and Improving LLMs": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive human-like performance across various reasoning tasks. However, their mastery of underlying inferential rules still falls short of human capabilities. To investigate this, we propose a logic scaffolding inferential rule generation framework, to construct an inferential rule base, ULogic, comprising both primitive and compositional rules across five domains. Our analysis of GPT-series models over a rule subset reveals significant gaps in LLMs' logic understanding compared to human performance, especially in compositional and structural complex rules with certain bias patterns. We further distill these rules into a smaller-scale inference engine for flexible rule generation and enhancing downstream reasoning. Through a multi-judger evaluation, our inference engine proves effective in generating accurate, complex, and abstract conclusions and premises, and improves various commonsense reasoning tasks. Overall, our work sheds light on LLMs' limitations in grasping inferential rules and suggests ways to enhance their logical reasoning abilities.",
    "Can LLMs Speak For Diverse People? Tuning LLMs via Debate to Generate Controllable Controversial Statements": "Making LLMs speak for different, especially minority groups of people, and generate statements supporting their diverse or even controversial perspectives is critical to creating an inclusive environment. However, existing LLMs lack sufficient controllability to the stance of their generated content, which often contains inconsistent, neutral, or biased statements. In this paper, we improve the controllability of LLMs in generating statements supporting an argument the user defined in the prompt. We find that multi-round debates between two LLMs with opposite stances generate higher-quality and more salient statements for each, which are important training data to improve the controllability of LLMs. Motivated by this, we develop a novel debate & tuning (“DEBATUNE”) pipeline finetuning LLMs to generate the statements obtained via debate. To examine DEBATUNE, we curate the largest dataset of debate topics so far, which covers 710 controversial topics and corresponding arguments for each topic. Evaluations by the GPT-4 judge with a novel controversy controllability metric show that LLMs' capability of generating diverse perspectives is significantly improved by DEBATUNE. Moreover, such controllability can be generalized to unseen topics, generating high-quality statements supporting controversial arguments.",
    "Can LLMs substitute SQL? Comparing Resource Utilization of Querying LLMs versus Traditional Relational Databases": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate or substitute different types of tasks in the software engineering process. This study evaluates the resource utilization and accuracy of LLM in interpreting and executing natural language queries against traditional SQL within relational database management systems. We empirically examine the resource utilization and accuracy of nine LLMs varying from 7 to 34 Billion parameters, including Llama2 7B, Llama2 13B, Mistral, Mixtral, Optimus-7B, SUS-chat-34B, platypus-yi-34b, NeuralHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B and Starling-LM-7B-alpha, using a small transaction dataset. Our findings indicate that using LLMs for database queries incurs significant energy overhead (even small and quantized models), making it an environmentally unfriendly approach. Therefore, we advise against replacing relational databases with LLMs due to their substantial resource utilization.",
    "Can Rule-Based Insights Enhance LLMs for Radiology Report Classification? Introducing the RadPrompt Methodology.": "Developing imaging models capable of detecting pathologies from chest X-rays can be cost and time-prohibitive for large datasets as it requires supervision to attain state-of-the-art performance. Instead, labels extracted from radiology reports may serve as distant supervision since these are routinely generated as part of clinical practice. Despite their widespread use, current rule-based methods for label extraction rely on extensive rule sets that are limited in their robustness to syntactic variability. To alleviate these limitations, we introduce RadPert, a rule-based system that integrates an uncertainty-aware information schema with a streamlined set of rules, enhancing performance. Additionally, we have developed RadPrompt, a multi-turn prompting strategy that leverages RadPert to bolster the zero-shot predictive capabilities of large language models, achieving a statistically significant improvement in weighted average F1 score over GPT-4 Turbo. Most notably, RadPrompt surpasses both its underlying models, showcasing the synergistic potential of LLMs with rule-based models. We have evaluated our methods on two English Corpora: the MIMIC-CXR gold-standard test set and a gold-standard dataset collected from the Cambridge University Hospitals.",
    "Can You Learn Semantics Through Next-Word Prediction? The Case of Entailment": "Do LMs infer the semantics of text from co-occurrence patterns in their training data? Merrill et al. (2022) argue that, in theory, sentence co-occurrence probabilities predicted by an optimal LM should reflect the entailment relationship of the constituent sentences, but it is unclear whether probabilities predicted by neural LMs encode entailment in this way because of strong assumptions made by Merrill et al. (namely, that humans always avoid redundancy). In this work, we investigate whether their theory can be used to decode entailment relations from neural LMs. We find that a test similar to theirs can decode entailment relations between natural sentences, well above random chance, though not perfectly, across many datasets and LMs. This suggests LMs implicitly model aspects of semantics to predict semantic effects on sentence co-occurrence patterns. However, we find the test that predicts entailment in practice works in the opposite direction to the theoretical test. We thus revisit the assumptions underlying the original test, finding its derivation did not adequately account for redundancy in human-written text. We argue that better accounting for redundancy related to explanations might derive the observed flipped test and, more generally, improve computational models of speakers in linguistics.",
    "Can Your Model Tell a Negation from an Implicature? Unravelling Challenges With Intent Encoders": "Conversational systems often rely on embedding models for intent classification and intent clustering tasks. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), which enable instructional embeddings allowing one to adjust semantics over the embedding space using prompts, are being viewed as a panacea for these downstream conversational tasks. However, traditional evaluation benchmarks rely solely on task metrics that don't particularly measure gaps related to semantic understanding. Thus, we propose an intent semantic toolkit that gives a more holistic view of intent embedding models by considering three tasks- (1) intent classification, (2) intent clustering, and (3) a novel triplet task. The triplet task gauges the model's understanding of two semantic concepts paramount in real-world conversational systems- negation and implicature. We observe that current embedding models fare poorly in semantic understanding of these concepts. To address this, we propose a pre-training approach to improve the embedding model by leveraging augmentation with data generated by an auto-regressive model and a contrastive loss term. Our approach improves the semantic understanding of the intent embedding model on the aforementioned linguistic dimensions while slightly effecting their performance on downstream task metrics.",
    "CANDLE: Iterative Conceptualization and Instantiation Distillation from Large Language Models for Commonsense Reasoning": "The sequential process of conceptualization and instantiation is essential to generalizable commonsense reasoning as it allows the application of existing knowledge to unfamiliar scenarios. However, existing works tend to undervalue the step of instantiation and heavily rely on pre-built concept taxonomies and human annotations to collect both types of knowledge, resulting in a lack of instantiated knowledge to complete reasoning, high cost, and limited scalability. To tackle these challenges, we introduce CANDLE (ConceptuAlization and INstantiation Distillation from Large Language ModEls), a distillation framework that iteratively performs contextualized conceptualization and instantiation over commonsense knowledge bases by instructing large language models to generate both types of knowledge with critic filtering. By applying CANDLE to ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019a), we construct a comprehensive knowledge base comprising six million conceptualizations and instantiated commonsense knowledge triples. Both types of knowledge are firmly rooted in the original ATOMIC dataset, and intrinsic evaluations demonstrate their exceptional quality and diversity. Empirical results indicate that distilling CANDLE on student models provides benefits across three downstream tasks.",
    "Causal and Temporal Inference in Visual Question Generation by Utilizing Pre-trained Models": "Visual Question Generation is a task at the crossroads of visual and language learning, impacting broad domains like education, medicine, and social media. While existing pre-trained models excel in fact-based queries with image pairs, they fall short of capturing human-like inference, particularly in understanding causal and temporal relationships within videos. Additionally, the computational demands of prevalent pre-training methods pose challenges. In response, our study introduces a framework that leverages vision-text matching pre-trained models to guide language models in recognizing event-entity relationships within videos and generating inferential questions. Demonstrating efficacy on the NExT-QA dataset, which is designed for causal and temporal inference in visual question answering, our method successfully guides pre-trained language models in recognizing video content. We present methodologies for abstracting causal and temporal relationships between events and entities, pointing out the importance of consistent relationships among input frames during training and inference phases and suggesting an avenue for future exploration.",
    "Causal Estimation of Memorisation Profiles": "Understanding memorisation in language models has practical and societal implications, e.g., studying models' training dynamics or preventing copyright infringements. Prior work defines memorisation as the causal effect of training with an instance on the model's ability to predict that instance. This definition relies on a counterfactual: the ability to observe what would have happened had the model not seen that instance. Existing methods struggle to provide computationally efficient and accurate estimates of this counterfactual. Further, they often estimate memorisation for a model architecture rather than for a specific model instance. This paper fills an important gap in the literature, proposing a new, principled, and efficient method to estimate memorisation based on the difference-in-differences design from econometrics. Using this method, we characterise a model's memorisation profile—its memorisation trends across training—by only observing its behaviour on a small set of instances throughout training. In experiments with the Pythia model suite, we find that memorisation (i) is stronger and more persistent in larger models, (ii) is determined by data order and learning rate, and (iii) has stable trends across model sizes, thus making memorisation in larger models predictable from smaller ones.",
    "Causal-Guided Active Learning for Debiasing Large Language Models": "Although achieving promising performance, recent analyses show that current generative large language models (LLMs) may still capture dataset biases and utilize them for generation, leading to poor generalizability and harmfulness of LLMs. However, due to the diversity of dataset biases and the over-optimization problem, previous prior-knowledge-based debiasing methods and fine-tuning-based debiasing methods may not be suitable for current LLMs. To address this issue, we explore combining active learning with the causal mechanisms and propose a casual-guided active learning (CAL) framework, which utilizes LLMs itself to automatically and autonomously identify informative biased samples and induce the bias patterns. Then a cost-effective and efficient in-context learning based method is employed to prevent LLMs from utilizing dataset biases during generation. Experimental results show that CAL can effectively recognize typical biased instances and induce various bias patterns for debiasing LLMs.",
    "CausalBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Causal Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models": "Causal reasoning, a core aspect of human cognition, is essential for advancing large language models (LLMs) towards artificial general intelligence (AGI) and reducing their propensity for generating hallucinations. However, existing datasets for evaluating causal reasoning in LLMs are limited by narrow domain coverage and a focus on cause-to-effect reasoning through textual problems, which does not comprehensively assess whether LLMs truly grasp causal relationships or merely guess correct answers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel benchmark that spans textual, mathematical, and coding problem domains. Each problem is crafted to probe causal understanding from four perspectives: cause-to-effect, effect-to-cause, cause-to-effect with intervention, and effect-to-cause with intervention. This multi-dimensional evaluation method ensures that LLMs must exhibit a genuine understanding of causal structures by correctly answering questions across all four dimensions, mitigating the possibility of correct responses by chance. Furthermore, our benchmark explores the relationship between an LLM's causal reasoning performance and its tendency to produce hallucinations. We present evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs using our benchmark, providing valuable insights into their current causal reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. The dataset is publicly available for download at https://huggingface.co/datasets/CCLV/CausalBench.",
    "CAUSALCITE: A Causal Formulation of Paper Citations": "Citation count of a paper is a commonly used proxy for evaluating the significance of a paper in the scientific community. Yet citation measures are widely criticized for failing to accurately reflect the true impact of a paper. Thus, we propose CAUSALCITE, a new way to measure the significance of a paper by assessing the causal impact of the paper on its follow-up papers. CAUSALCITE is based on a novel causal inference method, TEXTMATCH, which adapts the traditional matching framework to high-dimensional text embeddings. TEXTMATCH encodes each paper using text embeddings from large language models (LLMs), extracts similar samples by cosine similarity, and synthesizes a counterfactual sample as the weighted average of similar papers according to their similarity values. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CAUSALCITE on various criteria, such as high correlation with paper impact as reported by scientific experts on a previous dataset of 1K papers, (test-of-time) awards for past papers, and its stability across various subfields of AI. We also provide a set of findings that can serve as suggested ways for future researchers to use our metric for a better understanding of the quality of a paper.",
    "CausalGym: Benchmarking causal interpretability methods on linguistic tasks": "Language models (LMs) have proven to be powerful tools for psycholinguistic research, but most prior work has focused on purely behavioural measures (e.g., surprisal comparisons). At the same time, research in model interpretability has begun to illuminate the causal mechanisms shaping LM behavior. To help bring these strands of research closer together, we introduce CausalGym. We adapt and expand the Syntax-Gym suite of tasks to benchmark the ability of interpretability methods to causally affect model behaviour. To illustrate how CausalGym can be used, we study the pythia models (14M-6.9B) and assess the causal efficacy of a wide range of interpretability methods, including linear probing and distributed alignment search (DAS). We find that DAS outperforms the other methods, and so we use it to study the learning trajectory of two difficult linguistic phenomena in pythia-1b: negative polarity item licensing and filler-gap dependencies. Our analysis shows that the mechanism implementing both of these tasks is learned in discrete stages, not gradually.",
    "CAUSE: Counterfactual Assessment of User Satisfaction Estimation in Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems": "An important unexplored aspect in previous work on user satisfaction estimation for Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems is their evaluation in terms of robustness for the identification of user dissatisfaction: current benchmarks for user satisfaction estimation in TOD systems are highly skewed towards dialogues for which the user is satisfied. The effect of having a more balanced set of satisfaction labels on performance is unknown. However, balancing the data with more dissatisfactory dialogue samples requires further data collection and human annotation, which is costly and time-consuming. In this work, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and unlock their ability to generate satisfaction-focused counterfactual dialogues to augment the set of original dialogues of a test collection. We gather human annotations to ensure the reliability of the generated samples. We evaluate two open-source LLMs as user satisfaction estimators on our augmented collection against state-of-the-art fine-tuned models. Our experiments show that when used as few-shot user satisfaction estimators, open-source LLMs show higher robustness to the increase in the number of dissatisfaction labels in the test collection than the fine-tuned state-of-the-art models. Our results shed light on the need for data augmentation approaches for user satisfaction estimation in TOD systems. We release our aligned counterfactual dialogues, which are curated by human annotation, to facilitate further research on this topic.",
    "CDEval: A Benchmark for Measuring the Cultural Dimensions of Large Language Models": "As the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has dramatically enhanced their capabilities, there has been a growing focus on the alignment problem to ensure their responsible and ethical use. While existing alignment efforts predominantly concentrate on universal values such as the HHH (helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness), the aspect of culture, which is inherently pluralistic and diverse, has not received adequate attention. This work introduces a new benchmark, CDEval, aimed at evaluating the cultural dimensions of LLMs. CDEval is constructed by incorporating both GPT-4's automated generation and human verification, covering six cultural dimensions across seven domains. Our comprehensive experiments provide intriguing insights into the culture of mainstream LLMs, highlighting both consistencies and variations across different dimensions and domains. The findings underscore the importance of integrating cultural considerations in LLM development, particularly for applications in diverse cultural settings. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Rykeryuhang/CDEval.",
    "Ceasefire at FIGNEWS 2024 Shared Task: Automated Detection and Annotation of Media Bias Using Large Language Models": "In this paper, we present our approach for FIGNEWS Subtask 1, which focuses on detecting bias in news media narratives about the Israel war on Gaza. We used a Large Language Model (LLM) and prompt engineering, using GPT-3.5 Turbo API, to create a model that automatically flags biased news media content with 99% accuracy. This approach provides Natural Language Processing (NLP) researchers with a robust and effective solution for automating bias detection in news media narratives using supervised learning algorithms. Additionally, this paper provides a detailed analysis of the labeled content, offering valuable insights into media bias in conflict reporting. Our work advances automated content analysis and enhances understanding of media bias.",
    "Cendol: Open Instruction-tuned Generative Large Language Models for Indonesian Languages": "Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable human-like capability in various domains and languages. However, a notable quality gap arises in low-resource languages, e.g., Indonesian indigenous languages, rendering them ineffective and inefficient in such linguistic contexts. To bridge this quality gap, we introduce Cendol, a collection of Indonesian LLMs encompassing both decoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures across a range of model sizes. We highlight Cendol's effectiveness across a diverse array of tasks, attaining ∼20% improvement, and demonstrate its capability to generalize to unseen tasks and indigenous languages of Indonesia. Furthermore, Cendol models showcase improved human favorability despite their limitations in capturing indigenous knowledge and cultural values in Indonesia. In addition, we discuss the shortcomings of parameter-efficient tunings, such as LoRA, for language adaptation. Alternatively, we propose the usage of vocabulary adaptation to enhance efficiency. Lastly, we evaluate the safety of Cendol and showcase that safety in pre-training in one language such as English is transferable to low-resource languages, such as Indonesian, even without RLHF and safety fine-tuning.",
    "CHAAI@SMM4H'24: Enhancing Social Media Health Prediction Certainty by Integrating Large Language Models with Transformer Classifiers": "This paper presents our approach for SMM4H 2024 Task 5, focusing on identifying tweets where users discuss their child's health conditions of ADHD, ASD, delayed speech, or asthma. Our approach uses a pipeline that combines transformer-based classifiers and GPT-4 large language models (LLMs). We first address data imbalance in the training set using topic modelling and under-sampling. Next, we train RoBERTa-based classifiers on the adjusted data. Finally, GPT-4 refines the classifier's predictions for uncertain cases (confidence below 0.9). This strategy achieved significant improvement over the baseline RoBERTa models. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of combining transformer classifiers and LLMs for extracting health insights from social media conversations.",
    "Chain of Logic: Rule-Based Reasoning with Large Language Models": "Rule-based reasoning, a fundamental type of legal reasoning, enables us to draw conclusions by accurately applying a rule to a set of facts. We explore causal language models as rule-based reasoners, specifically with respect to compositional rules - rules consisting of multiple elements which form a complex logical expression. Reasoning about compositional rules is challenging because it requires multiple reasoning steps, and attending to the logical relationships between elements. We introduce a new prompting method, Chain of Logic, which elicits rule-based reasoning through decomposition (solving elements as independent threads of logic), and recomposition (recombining these sub-answers to resolve the underlying logical expression). This method was inspired by the IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) framework, a sequential reasoning approach used by lawyers. We evaluate chain of logic across eight rule-based reasoning tasks involving three distinct compositional rules from the LegalBench benchmark and demonstrate it consistently outperforms other prompting methods, including chain of thought and self-ask, using open-source and commercial language models.",
    "Chain-of-Exemplar: Enhancing Distractor Generation for Multimodal Educational Question Generation": "Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are important in enhancing concept learning and student engagement for educational purposes. Despite the multimodal nature of educational content, current methods focus mainly on text-based inputs and often neglect the integration of visual information. In this work, we study the problem of multimodal educational question generation, which aims at generating subject-specific educational questions with plausible yet incorrect distractors based on multimodal educational content. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel framework, named Chain-of-Exemplar (CoE), which utilizes multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with Chain-of-Thought reasoning to improve the generation of challenging distractors. Furthermore, CoE leverages three-stage contextualized exemplar retrieval to retrieve exemplary questions as guides for generating more subject-specific educational questions. Experimental results on the ScienceQA benchmark demonstrate the superiority of CoE in both question generation and distractor generation over existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.",
    "Chain-of-History Reasoning for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting": "Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) forecasting aims to predict future facts based on given histories. Most recent graph-based models excel at capturing structural information within TKGs but lack semantic comprehension abilities. Nowadays, with the surge of LLMs, the LLM-based TKG prediction model has emerged. However, the existing LLM-based model exhibits three shortcomings: (1) It only focuses on the first-order history for prediction while ignoring high-order historical information, resulting in the provided information for LLMs being extremely limited. (2) LLMs struggle with optimal reasoning performance under heavy historical information loads. (3) For TKG prediction, the temporal reasoning capability of LLM alone is limited. To address the first two challenges, we propose Chain-of-History (CoH) reasoning which explores high-order histories step-by-step, achieving effective utilization of high-order historical information for LLMs on TKG prediction. To address the third issue, we design CoH as a plug-and-play module to enhance the performance of graph-based models for TKG prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets and backbones demonstrate the effectiveness of CoH.",
    "Chain-of-Question: A Progressive Question Decomposition Approach for Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering": "Complex KBQA leverages the knowledge base (KB) to answer complex natural questions involving complicated semantics like multi-hop reasoning. Existing methods involve a question decomposition process, i.e., breaking a complex question into several simpler sub-questions, to assist obtaining logical forms for querying the KB. However, existing question decomposition process derives all sub-questions directly according to the original question, resulting in limitations when one sub-question relies on the answer from a previous one. In this work, we propose Chain-of-Question, a progressive question decomposition approach to address complex KBQA challenges. First, inspired by chain-of-thought, we design a prompt to guide LLM to sequentially decompose multiple semantically clear sub-questions and provide corresponding reference answers, where each step of the decomposition relies on the previous results. Next, we utilize the decomposition result to select relevant patterns (relation-entity pairs) as accurate and faithful auxiliary information for the following logical form generation. Finally, we jointly perform logical form generation and answer prediction, utilizing the predicted answer to supplement non-executable logical forms. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.",
    "Chain-of-Quizzes: Pedagogy-inspired Example Selection in In-Context-Learning": "In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing large language models (LLMs) in addressing downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the vital task of example selection in ICL by mimicking the human learning process. We propose a Chain-of-Quizzes (CoQ) framework inspired by educational theories such as Bruner's Spiral Learning and Mastery Learning theory. Specifically, our framework employs the LLMs to answer the quiz (question in the example) to sift 'good' examples, combines these examples iteratively with the increasing complexity, and utilizes a final exam to gauge the combined example chains. Our extensive experiments on diverse reasoning datasets show the proposed approach outperforms baseline models. These findings underscore the framework's potential for future research. The code and data will be made available here1.",
    "Chain-of-Verification Reduces Hallucination in Large Language Models": "Generation of plausible yet incorrect factual information, termed hallucination, is an unsolved issue in large language models. We study the ability of language models to deliberate on the responses they give in order to correct their mistakes. We develop the Chain-of-Verification (COVE) method whereby the model first (i) drafts an initial response; then (ii) plans verification questions to fact-check its draft; (iii) answers those questions independently so the answers are not biased by other responses; and (iv) generates its final verified response. In experiments, we show COVE decreases hallucinations across a variety of tasks, from list-based questions from Wikidata, closed book Multi-SpanQA and longform text generation.",
    "Challenges in End-to-End Policy Extraction from Climate Action Plans": "Gray policy literature such as climate action plans (CAPs) provide an information-rich resource with potential to inform analysis and decision-making. However, these corpora are currently underutilized due to the substantial manual effort and expertise required to sift through long and detailed documents. Automatically structuring relevant information using information extraction (IE) would be useful for assisting policy scientists in synthesizing vast gray policy corpora to identify relevant entities, concepts, and themes. LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on IE tasks in the few-shot setting, but it is unclear whether these gains transfer to gray policy literature which differs significantly to traditional benchmark datasets in several aspects, such as format of information content, length of documents, and inconsistency of document structure. We perform a case study on end-to-end IE with California CAPs, inspecting the performance of state-of-the-art tools for: (1) extracting content from CAPs into structured markup segments; (2) few-shot IE with LLMs; and (3) the utility of extracted entities for downstream analyses. We identify challenges at several points of the end-to-end IE pipeline for CAPs, and we provide recommendations for open problems centered around representing rich non-textual elements, document structure, flexible annotation schemes, and global information. Tackling these challenges would make it possible to realize the potential of LLMs for IE with gray policy literature.",
    "Challenges in Urdu Machine Translation": "Recent advancements in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems have significantly improved model performance on various translation benchmarks. However, these systems still face numerous challenges when translating low-resource languages such as Urdu. In this work, we highlight the specific issues faced by machine translation systems when translating Urdu language. We first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of English to Urdu Machine Translation with four diverse models: GPT-3.5 (a large language model), opus-mt-en-ur (a bilingual translation model), NLLB (a model trained for translating 200 languages) and IndicTrans2 (a specialized model for translating low-resource Indic languages). The results demonstrate that IndicTrans2 significantly outperforms other models in Urdu Machine Translation. To understand the differences in the performance of these models, we analyze the Urdu word distribution in different training datasets and compare the training methodologies. Finally, we uncover the specific translation issues and provide suggestions for improvements in Urdu machine translation systems.",
    "Challenging Large Language Models with New Tasks: A Study on their Adaptability and Robustness": "Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has marked a notable milestone in the field of artificial intelligence. The conventional evaluation of LLMs primarily relies on existing tasks and benchmarks, raising concerns about test set contamination and the genuine comprehension abilities of LLMs. To address these concerns, we propose to evaluate LLMs by designing new tasks, automatically generating evaluation datasets for the tasks, and conducting detailed error analyses to scrutinize LLMs' adaptability to new tasks, their sensitivity to prompt variations, and their error tendencies. We investigate the capacity of LLMs to adapt to new but simple tasks, especially when they diverge from the models' pre-existing knowledge. Our methodology emphasizes the creation of straightforward tasks, facilitating a precise error analysis to uncover the underlying causes of LLM failures. This strategic approach also aims to uncover effective strategies for enhancing LLM performance based on the detailed error analysis of system output.",
    "Chamain: Harmonizing Character Persona Integrity with Domain-Adaptive Knowledge in Dialogue Generation": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown their capacity for generating natural dialogues, leveraging extensive pre-trained knowledge. However, the seamless integration of domain-specific knowledge into dialogue agents, without undermining their personas or unique textual style, remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches, such as constructing knowledge-aware character dialogue datasets or training LLMs from the ground up, require considerable resources. Sequentially fine-tuning character chatbots across multiple datasets or applying existing merging techniques often leads to catastrophic forgetting, resulting in the loss of both knowledge and the character's distinct persona. This compromises the model's ability to consistently generate character-driven dialogues within a user-centric framework. In this context, we introduce a novel model merging method, Chamain, which effortlessly enhances the performance of character models, much like finding a “free lunch”. Chamain merges domain-specific knowledge into a character model by parameter-wise weight combination of instruction-tuned models and learns to reflect persona's unique characteristics and style through Layer-wise merging. Our experiments demonstrate that Chamain effectively maintains style while also solving domain-specific problems to a certain extent compared to the baselines, even showing a higher style probability compared to the character model in legal QA.",
    "CHAMP: A Competition-level Dataset for Fine-Grained Analyses of LLMs' Mathematical Reasoning Capabilities": "Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown indications of mathematical reasoning ability on challenging competition-level problems, especially with self-generated verbalizations of intermediate reasoning steps (i.e., chain-of-thought prompting). However, current evaluations mainly focus on the end-to-end final answer correctness, and it is unclear whether LLMs can make use of helpful side information such as problem-specific hints. In this paper, we propose a challenging benchmark dataset for enabling such analyses. The Concept and Hint-Annotated Math Problems (CHAMP) consists of high school math competition problems, annotated with concepts, or general math facts, and hints, or problem-specific tricks. These annotations allow us to explore the effects of additional information, such as relevant hints, misleading concepts, or related problems. This benchmark is difficult, with the best model only scoring 58.1% in standard settings. With concepts and hints, performance sometimes improves, indicating that some models can make use of such side information. Furthermore, we annotate model-generated solutions for their correctness. Using this corpus, we find that models often arrive at the correct final answer through wrong reasoning steps. In addition, we test whether models are able to verify these solutions, and find that most models struggle.",
    "Chaos with Keywords: Exposing Large Language Models Sycophancy to Misleading Keywords and Evaluating Defense Strategies": "This study explores the sycophantic tendencies of Large Language Models (LLMs), where these models tend to provide answers that match what users want to hear, even if they are not entirely correct. The motivation behind this exploration stems from the common behavior observed in individuals searching the internet for facts with partial or misleading knowledge. Similar to using web search engines, users may recall fragments of misleading keywords and submit them to an LLM, hoping for a comprehensive response. Our empirical analysis of several LLMs shows the potential danger of these models amplifying misinformation when presented with misleading keywords. Additionally, we thoroughly assess four existing hallucination mitigation strategies to reduce LLMs sycophantic behavior. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies for generating factually correct statements. Furthermore, our analyses delve into knowledge-probing experiments on factual keywords and different categories of sycophancy mitigation.",
    "CharacterEval: A Chinese Benchmark for Role-Playing Conversational Agent Evaluation": "Recently, the advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized generative agents. Among them, Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs) attract considerable attention due to their ability to emotionally engage users. However, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark impedes progress in this field. To bridge this gap, we introduce CharacterEval, a Chinese benchmark for comprehensive RPCA assessment, complemented by a tailored high-quality dataset. The dataset comprises 1,785 multi-turn role-playing dialogues, encompassing 11,376 examples and featuring 77 characters derived from Chinese novels and scripts. It was carefully constructed, beginning with initial dialogue extraction via GPT-4, followed by rigorous human-led quality control, and enhanced with in-depth character profiles sourced from Baidu Baike. CharacterEval employs a multifaceted evaluation approach, encompassing thirteen targeted metrics on four dimensions. To facilitate the convenient evaluation for these subjective metrics in CharacterEval, we further developed CharacterRM, a role-playing reward model based on human annotations, which has a higher correlation with human judgment compared to GPT-4. Comprehensive experiments on CharacterEval demonstrate that Chinese LLMs exhibit more promising capabilities than GPT-4 in Chinese role-playing conversation. Source code, data source, and reward model will be publicly accessible at https://github.com/morecry/CharacterEval.",
    "Characterizing Large Language Models as Rationalizers of Knowledge-intensive Tasks": "Large language models (LLMs) are proficient at generating fluent text with minimal task-specific supervision. However, their ability to generate rationales for knowledge-intensive tasks (KITs) remains under-explored. Generating rationales for KIT solutions, such as commonsense multiple-choice QA, requires external knowledge to support predictions and refute alternate options. In this work, we consider the task of generating retrieval-augmented rationalization of KIT model predictions via external knowledge guidance within a few-shot setting. Surprisingly, crowd-workers preferred LLM-generated rationales over existing crowd-sourced rationales, generated in a similar knowledge-guided setting, on aspects such as factuality, sufficiency, and convincingness. However, fine-grained evaluation of such rationales highlights the need for further improvements in conciseness, novelty, and domain invariance. Additionally, through an expert-sourced study evaluating the reliability of the rationales, we demonstrate that humans' trust in LLM-generated rationales erodes when communicated faithfully, i.e., without taking model prediction accuracy into account. We find that even instrumenting simple guardrails can be effective for reliable rationalization.",
    "Characterizing Similarities and Divergences in Conversational Tones in Humans and LLMs by Sampling with People": "Conversational tones - the manners and attitudes in which speakers communicate - are essential to effective communication. Amidst the increasing popularization of Large Language Models (LLMs) over recent years, it becomes necessary to characterize the divergences in their conversational tones relative to humans. However, existing investigations of conversational modalities rely on pre-existing taxonomies or text corpora, which suffer from experimenter bias and may not be representative of real-world distributions for the studies' psycholinguistic domains. Inspired by methods from cognitive science, we propose an iterative method for simultaneously eliciting conversational tones and sentences, where participants alternate between two tasks: (1) one participant identifies the tone of a given sentence and (2) a different participant generates a sentence based on that tone. We run 100 iterations of this process with human participants and GPT-4, then obtain a dataset of sentences and frequent conversational tones. In an additional experiment, humans and GPT-4 annotated all sentences with all tones. With data from 1,339 human participants, 33,370 human judgments, and 29,900 GPT-4 queries, we show how our approach can be used to create an interpretable geometric representation of relations between conversational tones in humans and GPT-4. This work demonstrates how combining ideas from machine learning and cognitive science can address challenges in human-computer interactions.",
    "Characterizing Stereotypical Bias from Privacy-preserving Pre-Training": "Differential Privacy (DP) can be applied to raw text by exploiting the spatial arrangement of words in an embedding space. We investigate the implications of such text privatization on Language Models (LMs) and their tendency towards stereotypical associations. Since previous studies documented that linguistic proficiency correlates with stereotypical bias, one could assume that techniques for text privatization, which are known to degrade language modeling capabilities, would cancel out undesirable biases. By testing BERT models trained on texts containing biased statements primed with varying degrees of privacy, our study reveals that while stereotypical bias generally diminishes when privacy is tightened, text privatization does not uniformly equate to diminishing bias across all social domains. This highlights the need for careful diagnosis of bias in LMs that undergo text privatization.",
    "CharPoet: A Chinese Classical Poetry Generation System Based on Token-free LLM": "Automatic Chinese classical poetry generation has attracted much research interest, but achieving effective control over format and content simultaneously remains challenging. Traditional systems usually accept keywords as user inputs, resulting in limited control over content. Large language models (LLMs) improve content control by allowing unrestricted user instructions, but the token-by-token generation process frequently makes format errors. Motivated by this, we propose CharPoet, a Chinese classical poetry generation system based on token-free LLM, which provides effective control over both format and content. Our token-free architecture generates in a character-by-character manner, enabling precise control over the number of characters. Pruned from existing token-based LLMs, CharPoet inherits their pretrained capabilities and can generate poetry following instructions like “Write me a poem for my mother's birthday.” CharPoet achieves format accuracy above 0.96, outperforming Jiuge-GPT-2 (0.91) and GPT-4 (0.38). In terms of content quality, CharPoet surpasses traditional systems including Jiuge, and is comparable to other LLMs. Our system is open source and available at https://modelscope.cn/models/CharPoet/CharPoet. A video demonstration of CharPoet is available at https://youtu.be/voZ25qEp3Dc.",
    "ChartInstruct: Instruction Tuning for Chart Comprehension and Reasoning": "Charts provide visual representations of data and are widely used for analyzing information, addressing queries, and conveying insights to others. Various chart-related downstream tasks have emerged recently, such as question-answering and summarization. A common strategy to solve these tasks is to fine-tune various models originally trained on vision tasks language. However, such task-specific models are not capable of solving a wide range of chart-related tasks, constraining their real-world applicability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ChartInstruct: a novel chart-specific vision-language Instruction-following dataset comprising 191K instructions generated with 71K charts. We then present two distinct systems for instruction tuning on such datasets: (1) an end-to-end model that connects a vision encoder for chart understanding with a LLM; and (2) a pipeline model that employs a two-step approach to extract chart data tables and input them into the LLM. In experiments on four downstream tasks, we first show the effectiveness of our model-achieving a new set of state-of-the-art results. Further evaluation shows that our instruction-tuning approach supports a wide array of real-world chart comprehension and reasoning scenarios, thereby expanding the scope and applicability of our models to new kinds of tasks.",
    "Chat Vector: A Simple Approach to Equip LLMs with Instruction Following and Model Alignment in New Languages": "Recently, the development of open-source large language models (LLMs) has advanced rapidly. Nevertheless, due to data constraints, the capabilities of most open-source LLMs are primarily focused on English. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of chat vector to equip pre-trained language models with instruction following and human value alignment via simple model arithmetic. The chat vector is derived by subtracting the weights of a pre-trained base model (e.g. LLaMA2) from those of its corresponding chat model (e.g. LLaMA2-chat). By simply adding the chat vector to a continual pre-trained model's weights, we can endow the model with chat capabilities in new languages without the need for further training. Our empirical studies demonstrate the superior efficacy of the chat vector from three different aspects: instruction following, toxicity mitigation, and multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, to showcase the adaptability of our approach, we extend our experiments to encompass various languages, base models, and chat vectors. The results underscore the chat vector's simplicity, effectiveness, and wide applicability, making it a compelling solution for efficiently enabling conversational capabilities in pre-trained language models.",
    "ChatDev: Communicative Agents for Software Development": "Software development is a complex task that necessitates cooperation among multiple members with diverse skills. Numerous studies used deep learning to improve specific phases in a waterfall model, such as design, coding, and testing. However, the deep learning model in each phase requires unique designs, leading to technical inconsistencies across various phases, which results in a fragmented and ineffective development process. In this paper, we introduce ChatDev, a chat-powered software development framework in which specialized agents driven by large language models (LLMs) are guided in what to communicate (via chat chain) and how to communicate (via communicative dehallucination). These agents actively contribute to the design, coding, and testing phases through unified language-based communication, with solutions derived from their multi-turn dialogues. We found their utilization of natural language is advantageous for system design, and communicating in programming language proves helpful in debugging. This paradigm demonstrates how linguistic communication facilitates multi-agent collaboration, establishing language as a unifying bridge for autonomous task-solving among LLM agents. The code and data are available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev.",
    "ChatKBQA: A Generate-then-Retrieve Framework for Knowledge Base Question Answering with Fine-tuned Large Language Models": "Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language questions over large-scale knowledge bases (KBs), which can be summarized into two crucial steps: knowledge retrieval and semantic parsing. However, three core challenges remain: inefficient knowledge retrieval, mistakes of retrieval adversely impacting semantic parsing, and the complexity of previous KBQA methods. To tackle these challenges, we introduce ChatKBQA, a novel and simple generate-then-retrieve KBQA framework, which proposes first generating the logical form with fine-tuned LLMs, then retrieving and replacing entities and relations with an unsupervised retrieval method, to improve both generation and retrieval more directly. Experimental results show that ChatKBQA achieves new state-of-the-art performance on standard KBQA datasets, WebQSP, and CWQ. This work can also be regarded as a new paradigm for combining LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) for interpretable and knowledge-required question answering. Our code is publicly available.",
    "ChatMol Copilot: An Agent for Molecular Modeling and Computation Powered by LLMs": "Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT excel at diverse tasks when given explicit instructions, yet they often struggle with specialized domains such as molecular science, lacking in-depth reasoning and sophisticated planning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce ChatMol Copilot, a chatbot-like agent specifically engineered for protein design and small molecule computations. ChatMol Copilot employs a multi-level abstraction framework to expand the LLM's capability. At the basic level, it integrates external computational tools through function calls, thus offloading complex tasks and enabling a focus on strategic decision-making. The second level is data abstraction. Large data sets (such as a large number of molecules created by a generative model) are stored in Redis cache, and the redis keys are referenced by LLMs for data sources involved in computation. The third level of abstraction allows the LLM to orchestrate these tools, either directly or via dynamically generated Python executables. Our evaluations demonstrate that ChatMol Copilot can adeptly manage molecular modeling tasks, effectively utilizing a variety of tools as directed. By simplifying access to sophisticated molecular modeling resources, ChatMol Copilot stands to significantly accelerate drug discovery and biotechnological innovation, empowering biochemists with advanced, user-friendly AI capabilities. The open-sourced code is available at https://github.com/ChatMol/ChatMol.",
    "ChatMusician: Understanding and Generating Music Intrinsically with LLMs": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in text generation, we find that their ability has yet to be generalized to music, humanity's creative language. We introduce ChatMusician, an open-source LLM that integrates intrinsic musical abilities. It is based on continual pre-training and fine-tuning LLaMA2 on a text-compatible music representation, ABC notation, and the music is treated as a second language. ChatMusician can understand and generate music with a pure text tokenizer without any external multi-modal neural structures or tokenizers. Interestingly, endowing musical abilities does not harm language abilities, even achieving a slightly higher MMLU score. Our model is capable of composing well-structured, full-length music, conditioned on texts, chords, melodies, motifs, musical forms, etc, surpassing the GPT-4 baseline. On our meticulously curated college-level music understanding benchmark, MusicTheory-Bench, ChatMusician surpasses LLaMA2 and GPT-3.5 in zero-shot setting by a noticeable margin. Our work reveals that LLMs can be an excellent compressor for music, but there remains significant territory to be conquered. We have open-sourced our 4B token music-language corpora MusicPile, the collected MusicTheoryBench, code, model and demo.",
    "CheckersGPT: Learning World Models through Language Modeling": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have been trained using just the next token prediction objective, these have shown impressive performance on various tasks. Consequently, it has attracted research interests in this regard. While one line of work in the past has suggested that LLMs learn surface-level statistics from the dataset, another line of work emphasizes that the learned representations are effective for simulating the underlying world model, considering the causal relationship for the next token prediction. This phenomenon is often referred to as the emergence of a world model in sequence prediction tasks. Recent work has demonstrated this phenomenon in a simulated setting of board games like Othello and Chess. In this paper, we analyze the game of Checkers to find out the emergence of a world model in a language model. By training a GPT-style autoregressive language model using only the next character prediction objective, we find that the model does show a hint of learning a world model representation of the board positions. We perform our analysis on two datasets: 1) synthetic dataset, which comes from the checkers game tree, and 2) human gameplay dataset. With multiple models trained with different layer sizes, we find that increasing the parameter size does help learn better world model representation decoded by linear probes.",
    "CHECKWHY: Causal Fact Verification via Argument Structure": "With the growing complexity of fact verification tasks, the concern with “thoughtful” reasoning capabilities is increasing. However, recent fact verification benchmarks mainly focus on checking a narrow scope of semantic factoids within claims and lack an explicit logical reasoning process. In this paper, we introduce CHECKWHY, a challenging dataset tailored to a novel causal fact verification task: checking the truthfulness of the causal relation within claims through rigorous reasoning steps. CHECKWHY consists of over 19K “why” claim-evidence-argument structure triplets with supports, refutes, and not enough info labels. Each argument structure is composed of connected evidence, representing the reasoning process that begins with foundational evidence and progresses toward claim establishment. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models, we validate the importance of incorporating the argument structure for causal fact verification. Moreover, the automated and human evaluation of argument structure generation reveals the difficulty in producing satisfying argument structure by fine-tuned models or Chain-of-Thought prompted LLMs, leaving considerable room for future improvements.",
    "Cheetah: Natural Language Generation for 517 African Languages": "Low-resource African languages pose unique challenges for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including natural language generation (NLG). In this paper, we develop Cheetah, a massively multilingual NLG language model for African languages. Cheetah supports 517 African languages and language varieties, allowing us to address the scarcity of NLG resources and provide a solution to foster linguistic diversity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Cheetah through comprehensive evaluations across six generation downstream tasks. In five of the six tasks, Cheetah significantly outperforms other models, showcasing its remarkable performance for generating coherent and contextually appropriate text in a wide range of African languages. We additionally conduct a detailed human evaluation to delve deeper into the linguistic capabilities of Cheetah. The findings of this study contribute to advancing NLP research in low-resource settings, enabling greater accessibility and inclusion for African languages in a rapidly expanding digital landscape.",
    "CHIME: LLM-Assisted Hierarchical Organization of Scientific Studies for Literature Review Support": "Literature review requires researchers to synthesize a large amount of information and is increasingly challenging as the scientific literature expands. In this work, we investigate the potential of LLMs for producing hierarchical organizations of scientific studies to assist researchers with literature review. We define hierarchical organizations as tree structures where nodes refer to topical categories and every node is linked to the studies assigned to that category. Our naive LLM-based pipeline for hierarchy generation from a set of studies produces promising yet imperfect hierarchies, motivating us to collect CHIME, an expert-curated dataset for this task focused on biomedicine. Given the challenging and time-consuming nature of building hierarchies from scratch, we use a human-in-the-loop process in which experts correct errors (both links between categories and study assignment) in LLM-generated hierarchies. CHIME contains 2,174 LLM-generated hierarchies covering 472 topics, and expert-corrected hierarchies for a subset of 100 topics. Expert corrections allow us to quantify LLM performance, and we find that while they are quite good at generating and organizing categories, their assignment of studies to categories could be improved. We attempt to train a corrector model with human feedback which improves study assignment by 12.6 F1 points. We release our dataset and models to encourage research on developing better assistive tools for literature review.",
    "CHIMED-GPT: A Chinese Medical Large Language Model with Full Training Regime and Better Alignment to Human Preferences": "Recently, the increasing demand for superior medical services has highlighted the discrepancies in the medical infrastructure. With big data, especially texts, forming the foundation of medical services, there is an exigent need for effective natural language processing (NLP) solutions tailored to the healthcare domain. Conventional approaches leveraging pre-trained models present promising results in this domain and current large language models (LLMs) offer advanced foundation for medical text processing. However, most medical LLMs are trained only with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), even though it efficiently empowers LLMs to understand and respond to medical instructions but is ineffective in learning domain knowledge and aligning with human preference. In this work, we propose CHIMED-GPT, a new benchmark LLM designed explicitly for Chinese medical domain, and undergoes a comprehensive training regime with pre-training, SFT, and RLHF. Evaluations on tasks including information extraction, question answering, and dialogue generation demonstrate CHIMED-GPT's superior performance over general domain LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze possible biases through prompting CHIMED-GPT to perform attitude scales regarding discrimination of patients, so as to contribute to further responsible development of LLMs in the medical domain.",
    "Chinchunmei at WASSA 2024 Empathy and Personality Shared Task: Boosting LLM's Prediction with Role-play Augmentation and Contrastive Reasoning Calibration": "This paper presents the Chinchunmei team's contributions to the WASSA2024 Shared-Task 1: Empathy Detection and Emotion Classification. We participated in Tracks 1, 2, and 3 to predict empathetic scores based on dialogue, article, and essay content. We choose Llama3-8b-instruct as our base model. We developed three supervised fine-tuning schemes: standard prediction, role-play, and contrastive prediction, along with an innovative scoring calibration method called Contrastive Reasoning Calibration during inference. Pearson Correlation was used as the evaluation metric across all tracks. For Track 1, we achieved 0.43 on the devset and 0.17 on the testset. For Track 2 emotion, empathy, and polarity labels, we obtained 0.64, 0.66, and 0.79 on the devset and 0.61, 0.68, and 0.58 on the testset. For Track 3 empathy and distress labels, we got 0.64 and 0.56 on the devset and 0.33 and 0.35 on the testset.",
    "Chinese Spelling Corrector Is Just a Language Learner": "This paper emphasizes Chinese spelling correction by means of self-supervised learning, which means there are no annotated errors within the training data. Our intuition is that humans are naturally good correctors with exposure to error-free sentences, which contrasts with current unsupervised methods that strongly rely on the usage of confusion sets to produce parallel sentences. In this paper, we demonstrate that learning a spelling correction model is identical to learning a language model from error-free data alone, with decoding it in a greater search space. We propose Denoising Decoding Correction (D2C), which selectively imposes noise upon the source sentence to determine the underlying correct characters. Our method is largely inspired by the ability of language models to perform correction, including both BERT-based models and large language models (LLMs). We show that the self-supervised learning manner generally outperforms the confusion set in specific domains because it bypasses the need to introduce error characters to the training data which can impair the error patterns not included in the introduced error characters.",
    "ChunkAttention: Efﬁcient Self-Attention with Preﬁx-Aware KV Cache and Two-Phase Partition": "Self-attention is an essential component of large language models (LLM) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLM serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8× compared to the start-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.",
    "CICLe: Conformal In-Context Learning for Largescale Multi-Class Food Risk Classification": "Contaminated or adulterated food poses a substantial risk to human health. Given sets of labeled web texts for training, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing can be applied to automatically detect such risks. We publish a dataset of 7,546 short texts describing public food recall announcements. Each text is manually labeled, on two granularity levels (coarse and fine), for food products and hazards that the recall corresponds to. We describe the dataset and benchmark naive, traditional, and Transformer models. Based on our analysis, Logistic Regression with a tf-idf representation outperforms RoBERTa and XLM-R on classes with low support. Finally, we discuss different prompting strategies and present an LLM-in-the-loop framework, based on Conformal Prediction, which boosts the performance of the base classifier while reducing energy consumption compared to normal prompting.",
    "CIDAR: Culturally Relevant Instruction Dataset For Arabic": "Instruction tuning has emerged as a prominent methodology for teaching Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions. However, current instruction datasets predominantly cater to English or are derived from English-dominated LLMs, leading to inherent biases toward Western culture. This bias negatively impacts non-English languages such as Arabic and the unique culture of the Arab region. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing CIDAR, the first open Arabic instruction-tuning dataset culturally aligned by native Arabic speakers. CIDAR contains 10,000 instruction and output pairs that represent the Arab region. We discuss the cultural relevance of CIDAR via the analysis and comparison to a few models fine-tuned on other datasets. Our experiments indicate that models fine-tuned on CIDAR achieve better cultural alignment compared to those fine-tuned on 30x more data. The dataset is available on HuggingFace https://huggingface.co/datasets/arbml/CIDAR.",
    "CIF-Bench: A Chinese Instruction-Following Benchmark for Evaluating the Generalizability of Large Language Models": "The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enhanced the ability to generalize across a wide range of unseen natural language processing (NLP) tasks through instruction-following. Yet, their effectiveness often diminishes in less-trained languages like Chinese, exacerbated by biased evaluations from data leakage, casting doubt on their true generalizability to new linguistic territories. In response, we introduce the Chinese Instruction-Following Benchmark (CIF-Bench), designed to evaluate the zero-shot generalizability of LLMs to the Chinese language. CIF-Bench comprises 150 tasks and 15,000 input-output pairs, developed by native speakers to test complex reasoning and Chinese cultural nuances across 20 categories. To mitigate data contamination, we release only half of the dataset publicly, with the remainder kept private, and introduce diversified instructions to minimize score variance, totaling 45,000 data instances. Our evaluation of 28 selected LLMs reveals a noticeable performance gap, with the best model scoring only 52.9%, highlighting the limitations of LLMs in less familiar language and task contexts. This work aims to uncover the current limitations of LLMs in handling Chinese tasks, pushing towards the development of more culturally informed and linguistically diverse models with the released data and benchmark.",
    "Citation-Enhanced Generation for LLM-based Chatbots": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit powerful general intelligence across diverse scenarios, including their integration into chatbots. However, a vital challenge of LLM-based chatbots is that they may produce hallucinated content in responses, which significantly limits their applicability. Various efforts have been made to alleviate hallucination, such as retrieval augmented generation and reinforcement learning with human feedback, but most of them require additional training and data annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel post-hoc Citation-Enhanced Generation (CEG) approach combined with retrieval argumentation. Unlike previous studies that focus on preventing hallucinations during generation, our method addresses this issue in a post-hoc way. It incorporates a retrieval module to search for supporting documents relevant to the generated content, and employs a natural language inference-based citation generation module. Once the statements in the generated content lack of reference, our model can regenerate responses until all statements are supported by citations. Note that our method is a training-free plug-and-play plugin that is capable of various LLMs. Experiments on various hallucination-related datasets show our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both hallucination detection and response regeneration on three benchmarks.",
    "CLAMBER: A Benchmark of Identifying and Clarifying Ambiguous Information Needs in Large Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to meet user information needs, but their effectiveness in dealing with user queries that contain various types of ambiguity remains unknown, ultimately risking user trust and satisfaction. To this end, we introduce CLAMBER, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs using a well-organized taxonomy. Building upon the taxonomy, we construct ∼12K high-quality data to assess the strengths, weaknesses, and potential risks of various off-the-shelf LLMs. Our findings indicate the limited practical utility of current LLMs in identifying and clarifying ambiguous user queries, even enhanced by chain-of-thought (CoT) and few-shot prompting. These techniques may result in overconfidence in LLMs and yield only marginal enhancements in identifying ambiguity. Furthermore, current LLMs fall short in generating high-quality clarifying questions due to a lack of conflict resolution and inaccurate utilization of inherent knowledge. In this paper, CLAMBER presents a guidance and promotes further research on proactive and trustworthy LLMs. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CLAMBER.",
    "ClinicalRAG: Enhancing Clinical Decision Support through Heterogeneous Knowledge Retrieval": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized text generation across diverse domains, showcasing an ability to mimic human-like text with remarkable accuracy. Yet, these models frequently encounter a significant hurdle: producing hallucinations, a flaw particularly detrimental in the healthcare domain where precision is crucial. In this paper, we introduce ClinicalRAG, a novel multi-agent pipeline to rectify this issue by incorporating heterogeneous medical knowledge—both structured and unstructured—into LLMs to bolster diagnosis accuracy. ClinicalRAG can extract related medical entities from user inputs and dynamically integrate relevant medical knowledge during the text generation process. Comparative analyses reveal that ClinicalRAG significantly outperforms knowledge-deficient methods, offering enhanced reliability in clinical decision support. This advancement marks a pivotal proof-of-concept step towards mitigating misinformation risks in healthcare applications of LLMs.",
    "CLOMO: Counterfactual Logical Modification with Large Language Models": "In this study, we delve into the realm of counterfactual reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Our primary objective is to cultivate the counterfactual thought processes within LLMs and rigorously assess these processes for their validity. Specifically, we introduce a novel task, Counterfactual Logical Modification (CLOMO), and a high-quality human-annotated benchmark. In this task, LLMs must adeptly alter a given argumentative text to uphold a predetermined logical relationship. To effectively evaluate a generation model's counterfactual capabilities, we propose an innovative evaluation metric, the decomposed Self-Evaluation Score (SES) to directly evaluate the natural language output of LLMs instead of modeling the task as a multiple-choice problem. Analysis shows that the proposed automatic metric aligns well with human preference. Our experimental results show that while LLMs demonstrate a notable capacity for logical counterfactual thinking, there remains a discernible gap between their current abilities and human performance. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Eleanor-H/CLOMO.",
    "CMMLU: Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding in Chinese": "As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, evaluating their performance is becoming more important and more challenging. This paper aims to address this issue for Mandarin Chinese in the form of CMMLU, a comprehensive Chinese benchmark that covers various subjects, including natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, and the humanities. We conduct a thorough evaluation of more than 20 contemporary multilingual and Chinese LLMs, assessing their performance across different subjects and settings. The results reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve an accuracy of even 60%, which is the pass mark for Chinese exams. This highlights that there is substantial room for improvement in the capabilities of LLMs. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to identify factors impacting model performance and propose directions for enhancing LLMs. CMMLU fills the gap in evaluating the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large language models for Chinese.",
    "CMoralEval: A Moral Evaluation Benchmark for Chinese Large Language Models": "What a large language model (LLM) would respond in ethically relevant context? In this paper, we curate a large benchmark CMoralEval for morality evaluation of Chinese LLMs. The data sources of CMoralEval are two-fold: 1) a Chinese TV program discussing Chinese moral norms with stories from the society and 2) a collection of Chinese moral anomies from various newspapers and academic papers on morality. With these sources, we aim to create a moral evaluation dataset characterized by diversity and authenticity. We develop a morality taxonomy and a set of fundamental moral principles that are not only rooted in traditional Chinese culture but also consistent with contemporary societal norms. To facilitate efficient construction and annotation of instances in CMoralEval, we establish a platform with AI-assisted instance generation to streamline the annotation process. These help us curate CMoralEval that encompasses both explicit moral scenarios (14,964 instances) and moral dilemma scenarios (15,424 instances), each with instances from different data sources. We conduct extensive experiments with CMoralEval to examine a variety of Chinese LLMs. Experiment results demonstrate that CMoralEval is a challenging benchmark for Chinese LLMs. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/CMoralEval.",
    "CMU's IWSLT 2024 Simultaneous Speech Translation System": "This paper describes CMU's submission to the IWSLT 2024 Simultaneous Speech Translation (SST) task for translating English speech to German text in a streaming manner. Our end-to-end speech-to-text (ST) system integrates the WavLM speech encoder, a modality adapter, and the Llama2-7B-Base model as the decoder. We employ a two-stage training approach: initially, we align the representations of speech and text, followed by full fine-tuning. Both stages are trained on MuST-c v2 data with cross-entropy loss. We adapt our offline ST model for SST using a simple fixed hold-n policy. Experiments show that our model obtains an offline BLEU score of 31.1 and a BLEU score of 29.5 under 2 seconds latency on the MuST-C-v2 tst-COMMON.",
    "CoCA: Fusing Position Embedding with Collinear Constrained Attention in Transformers for Long Context Window Extending": "Self-attention and position embedding are two crucial modules in transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the potential relationship between them is far from well studied, especially for long context window extending. In fact, anomalous behaviors that hinder long context extrapolation exist between Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and vanilla self-attention. Incorrect initial angles between Q and K can cause misestimation in modeling rotary position embedding of the closest tokens. To address this issue, we propose Collinear Constrained Attention mechanism, namely CoCA. Specifically, we enforce a collinear constraint between Q and K to seamlessly integrate RoPE and self-attention. While only adding minimal computational and spatial complexity, this integration significantly enhances long context window extrapolation ability. We provide an optimized implementation, making it a drop-in replacement for any existing transformer-based models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoCA excels in extending context windows. A CoCA-based GPT model, trained with a context length of 512, can extend the context window up to 32K (60×) without any fine-tuning. Additionally, incorporating CoCA into LLaMA-7B achieves extrapolation up to 32K within a training length of only 2K.",
    "Cocktail: A Comprehensive Information Retrieval Benchmark with LLM-Generated Documents Integration": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to an influx of AI-generated content (AIGC) on the internet, transforming the corpus of Information Retrieval (IR) systems from solely human-written to a coexistence with LLM-generated content. The impact of this surge in AIGC on IR systems remains an open question, with the primary challenge being the lack of a dedicated benchmark for researchers. In this paper, we introduce Cocktail, a comprehensive benchmark tailored for evaluating IR models in this mixed-sourced data landscape of the LLM era. Cocktail consists of 16 diverse datasets with mixed human-written and LLM-generated corpora across various text retrieval tasks and domains. Additionally, to avoid the potential bias from previously included dataset information in LLMs, we also introduce an up-to-date dataset, named NQ-UTD, with queries derived from recent events. Through conducting over 1,000 experiments to assess state-of-the-art retrieval models against the benchmarked datasets in Cocktail, we uncover a clear trade-off between ranking performance and source bias in neural retrieval models, highlighting the necessity for a balanced approach in designing future IR systems. We hope Cocktail can serve as a foundational resource for IR research in the LLM era, with all data and code publicly available at https://github.com/KID-22/Cocktail.",
    "CoCo-Agent: A Comprehensive Cognitive MLLM Agent for Smartphone GUI Automation": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential as human-like autonomous language agents to interact with real-world environments, especially for graphical user interface (GUI) automation. However, those GUI agents require comprehensive cognition including exhaustive perception and reliable action response. We propose a Comprehensive Cognitive LLM Agent, CoCo-Agent, with two novel approaches, comprehensive environment perception (CEP) and conditional action prediction (CAP), to systematically improve the GUI automation performance. First, CEP facilitates the GUI perception through different aspects and granularity, including screenshots and complementary detailed layouts for the visual channel and historical actions for the textual channel. Second, CAP decomposes the action prediction into sub-problems: determining the action type and then identifying the action target conditioned on the action type. With our technical design, our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on AITW and META-GUI benchmarks, showing promising abilities in realistic scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/xbmxb/CoCo-Agent.",
    "COCONUT: Contextualized Commonsense Unified Transformers for Graph-Based Commonsense Augmentation of Language Models": "In this paper, we introduce COCONUT to effectively guide the contextualization of structured commonsense knowledge based on large language models. COCONUT employs a contextualized knowledge prompting scheme to gather high-quality contextualization examples from a large language model. These examples are subsequently distilled into small language models to enhance their contextualization capability. Extensive evaluations show that COCONUT considerably improves commonsense reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks, models, and settings, exhibiting its flexibility and universality in generating contextualized commonsense knowledge. Notably, COCONUT consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art technique by an average of 5.8%.",
    "Code Needs Comments: Enhancing Code LLMs with Comment Augmentation": "The programming skill is one crucial ability for Large Language Models (LLMs), necessitating a deep understanding of programming languages (PLs) and their correlation with natural languages (NLs). We examine the impact of pre-training data on code-focused LLMs' performance by assessing the comment density as a measure of PL-NL alignment. Given the scarcity of code-comment aligned data in pre-training corpora, we introduce a novel data augmentation method that generates comments for existing code, coupled with a data filtering strategy that filters out code data poorly correlated with natural language. We conducted experiments on three code-focused LLMs and observed consistent improvements in performance on two widely-used programming skill benchmarks. Notably, the model trained on the augmented data outperformed both the model used for generating comments and the model further trained on the data without augmentation.",
    "CODEAGENT: Enhancing Code Generation with Tool-Integrated Agent Systems for Real-World Repo-level Coding Challenges": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automated code generation but typically excel only in simpler tasks such as generating standalone code units. However, real-world software development often involves complex code repositories with complex dependencies and extensive documentation. To enable LLMs to handle these real-world repo-level code generation, we present CODEAGENT, a novel LLM-based agent framework that employs external tools for effective repo-level code generation. CODEAGENT integrates five programming tools, enabling interaction with software artifacts for information retrieval, code implementation, and code testing. We implement four agent strategies to optimize these tools' usage. To the best of our knowledge, CODEAGENT is the first agent framework specifically for repo-level code generation. In order to measure the effectiveness of our method at the repository level, we design a repo-level benchmark CODEAGENTBENCH. The performance on this benchmark shows a significant improvement brought by our method, with improvements in pass rate ranging from 2.0 to 15.8. Further tests on the HumanEval benchmark confirm CODEAGENT's adaptability and efficacy across various code generation tasks. Notably, CODEAGENT outperforms commercial products like GitHub Copilot, showcasing superior accuracy and efficiency. These results demonstrate CODEAGENT's robust capabilities in code generation, highlighting its potential for real-world repo-level coding challenges.",
    "CodeAttack: Revealing Safety Generalization Challenges of Large Language Models via Code Completion": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought about remarkable generative capabilities but also raised concerns about their potential misuse. While strategies like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback have enhanced their safety, these methods primarily focus on natural languages, which may not generalize to other domains. This paper introduces CodeAttack, a framework that transforms natural language inputs into code inputs, presenting a novel environment for testing the safety generalization of LLMs. Our comprehensive studies on state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4, Claude-2, and Llama-2 series reveal a new and universal safety vulnerability of these models against code input: CodeAttack bypasses the safety guardrails of all models more than 80% of the time. We find that a larger distribution gap between CodeAttack and natural language leads to weaker safety generalization, such as encoding natural language input with data structures. Furthermore, we give our hypotheses about the success of CodeAttack: the misaligned bias acquired by LLMs during code training, prioritizing code completion over avoiding the potential safety risk. Finally, we analyze potential mitigation measures. These findings highlight new safety risks in the code domain and the need for more robust safety alignment algorithms to match the code capabilities of LLMs.",
    "CodeInsight: A Curated Dataset of Practical Coding Solutions from Stack Overflow": "We introduce a novel dataset tailored for code generation, aimed at aiding developers in common tasks. Our dataset provides examples that include a clarified intent, code snippets associated, and an average of three related unit tests. It encompasses a range of libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Regex, along with more than 70 standard libraries in Python code derived from Stack Overflow. Comprising 3,409 crafted examples by Python experts, our dataset is designed for both model finetuning and standalone evaluation. To complete unit tests evaluation, we categorize examples in order to get more fine-grained analysis, enhancing the understanding of models' strengths and weaknesses in specific coding tasks. The examples have been refined to reduce data contamination, a process confirmed by the performance of three leading models: Mistral 7B, CodeLLaMa 13B, and Starcoder 15B. We further investigate data-contamination testing GPT-4 performance on a part of our dataset. The benchmark can be accessed at https://github.com/NathanaelBeau/CodeInsight.",
    "CODEM: Less Data Yields More Versatility via Ability Matrix": "In the era of code large language models (code LLMs), data engineering plays a pivotal role during the instruction fine-tuning phase. To train a versatile model, previous efforts devote tremendous efforts to crafting instruction data that covers all the downstream scenarios. Nonetheless, this will incur significant expenses in data construction and model training. Therefore, this paper introduces CODEM, a novel data construction strategy, which can efficiently train a versatile model using less data via our newly proposed ability matrix. CODEM uses ability matrix to decouple code LLMs' abilities into two dimensions, constructing a lightweight training corpus that only covers a subset of target scenarios. Extensive experiments on HumanEvalPack and MultiPL-E reveal that code LLMs can combine the single-dimensional abilities to master composed abilities, validating the effectiveness of CODEM.",
    "CodeScope: An Execution-based Multilingual Multitask Multidimensional Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Code Understanding and Generation": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on assisting humans in programming and facilitating programming automation. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating the code understanding and generation capacities of LLMs suffer from severe limitations. First, most benchmarks are insufficient as they focus on a narrow range of popular programming languages and specific tasks, whereas real-world software development scenarios show a critical need to implement systems with multilingual and multitask programming environments to satisfy diverse requirements. Second, most benchmarks fail to consider the actual executability and the consistency of execution results of the generated code. To bridge these gaps between existing benchmarks and expectations from practical applications, we introduce CodeScope, an execution-based, multilingual, multitask, multidimensional evaluation benchmark for comprehensively measuring LLM capabilities on coding tasks. CodeScope covers 43 programming languages and eight coding tasks. It evaluates the coding performance of LLMs from three dimensions (perspectives): length, difficulty, and efficiency. To facilitate execution-based evaluations of code generation, we develop MultiCodeEngine, an automated code execution engine that supports 14 programming languages. Finally, we systematically evaluate and analyze eight mainstream LLMs and demonstrate the superior breadth and challenges of CodeScope for evaluating LLMs on code understanding and generation tasks compared to other benchmarks. The CodeScope benchmark and code are publicly available at https://github.com/WeixiangYAN/CodeScope.",
    "CODIS: Benchmarking Context-Dependent Visual Comprehension for Multimodal Large Language Models": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising results in a variety of tasks that combine vision and language. As these models become more integral to research and applications, conducting comprehensive evaluations of their capabilities has grown increasingly important. However, most existing benchmarks fail to consider that, in certain situations, images need to be interpreted within a broader context. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark, named as CODIS, designed to assess the ability of models to use context provided in free-form text to enhance visual comprehension. Our findings indicate that MLLMs consistently fall short of human performance on this benchmark. Further analysis confirms that these models struggle to effectively extract and utilize contextual information to improve their understanding of images. This underscores the pressing need to enhance the ability of MLLMs to comprehend visuals in a context-dependent manner. View our project website at https://thunlp-mt.github.io/CODIS.",
    "CofiPara: A Coarse-to-fine Paradigm for Multimodal Sarcasm Target Identification with Large Multimodal Models": "Social media abounds with multimodal sarcasm, and identifying sarcasm targets is particularly challenging due to the implicit incongruity not directly evident in the text and image modalities. Current methods for Multimodal Sarcasm Target Identification (MSTI) predominantly focus on superficial indicators in an end-to-end manner, overlooking the nuanced understanding of multimodal sarcasm conveyed through both the text and image. This paper proposes a versatile MSTI framework with a coarse-to-fine paradigm, by augmenting sarcasm explainability with reasoning and pre-training knowledge. Inspired by the powerful capacity of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on multimodal reasoning, we first engage LMMs to generate competing rationales for coarser-grained pre-training of a small language model on multimodal sarcasm detection. We then propose fine-tuning the model for finer-grained sarcasm target identification. Our framework is thus empowered to adeptly unveil the intricate targets within multimodal sarcasm and mitigate the negative impact posed by potential noise inherently in LMMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our model far outperforms state-of-the-art MSTI methods, and markedly exhibits explainability in deciphering sarcasm as well.",
    "CoGenesis: A Framework Collaborating Large and Small Language Models for Secure Context-Aware Instruction Following": "With the advancement of language models (LMs), their exposure to private data is increasingly inevitable, and their deployment (especially for smaller ones) on personal devices, such as PCs and smartphones, has become a prevailing trend. In contexts laden with user information, enabling models to both safeguard user privacy and execute commands efficiently emerges as an essential research imperative. In this paper, we propose CoGenesis, a collaborative generation framework integrating large (hosted on cloud infrastructure) and small models (deployed on local devices) to address privacy concerns logically. Initially, we design a pipeline to create personalized writing instruction datasets enriched with extensive context details as the testbed of this research issue. Subsequently, we introduce two variants of CoGenesis based on sketch and logits respectively. Our experimental findings, based on our synthesized dataset and two additional open-source datasets, indicate that: 1) Large-scale models perform well when provided with user context but struggle in the absence of such context. 2) While specialized smaller models fine-tuned on the synthetic dataset show promise, they still lag behind their larger counterparts. 3) Our CoGenesis framework, utilizing mixed-scale models, showcases competitive performance, providing a feasible solution to privacy issues.",
    "CogMG: Collaborative Augmentation Between Large Language Model and Knowledge Graph": "Large language models have become integral to question-answering applications despite their propensity for generating hallucinations and factually inaccurate content. Querying knowledge graphs to reduce hallucinations in LLM meets the challenge of incomplete knowledge coverage in knowledge graphs. On the other hand, updating knowledge graphs by information extraction and knowledge graph completion faces the knowledge update misalignment issue. In this work, we introduce a collaborative augmentation framework, CogMG, leveraging knowledge graphs to address the limitations of LLMs in QA scenarios, explicitly targeting the problems of incomplete knowledge coverage and knowledge update misalignment. The LLMs identify and decompose required knowledge triples that are not present in the KG, enriching them and aligning updates with real-world demands. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through a supervised fine-tuned LLM within an agent framework, showing significant improvements in reducing hallucinations and enhancing factual accuracy in QA responses. Our code1 and video2 are publicly available.",
    "Cognitive Visual-Language Mapper: Advancing Multimodal Comprehension with Enhanced Visual Knowledge Alignment": "Evaluating and Rethinking the current landscape of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), we observe that widely-used visual-language projection approaches (e.g., Q-former or MLP) focus on the alignment of image-text descriptions yet ignore the visual knowledge-dimension alignment, i.e., connecting visuals to their relevant knowledge. Visual knowledge plays a significant role in analyzing, inferring, and interpreting information from visuals, helping improve the accuracy of answers to knowledge-based visual questions. In this paper, we mainly explore improving LMMs with visual-language knowledge alignment, especially aimed at challenging knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA). To this end, we present a Cognitive Visual-Language Mapper (CVLM), which contains a pretrained Visual Knowledge Aligner (VKA) and a Fine-grained Knowledge Adapter (FKA) used in the multimodal instruction tuning stage. Specifically, we design the VKA based on the interaction between a small language model and a visual encoder, training it on collected image-knowledge pairs to achieve visual knowledge acquisition and projection. FKA is employed to distill the fine-grained visual knowledge of an image and inject it into Large Language Models (LLMs). We conduct extensive experiments on knowledge-based VQA benchmarks and experimental results show that CVLM significantly improves the performance of LMMs on knowledge-based VQA (average gain by 5.0%). Ablation studies also verify the effectiveness of VKA and FKA, respectively.",
    "COKE: A Cognitive Knowledge Graph for Machine Theory of Mind": "Theory of mind (ToM) refers to humans' ability to understand and infer the desires, beliefs, and intentions of others. The acquisition of ToM plays a key role in humans' social cognition and interpersonal relations. Though indispensable for social intelligence, ToM is still lacking for modern AI and NLP systems since they cannot access the human mental state and cognitive process beneath the training corpus. To empower AI systems with the ToM ability and narrow the gap between them and humans, in this paper, we propose COKE: the first cognitive knowledge graph for machine theory of mind, formalizing cognitive processes as a chained structure. Specifically, COKE formalizes ToM as a collection of 45k+ manually verified cognitive chains that characterize human mental activities and subsequent behavioral/affective responses when facing specific social circumstances. In addition, we further generalize COKE using LLMs and build a powerful generation model COLM tailored for cognitive reasoning. Experimental results in both automatic and human evaluation demonstrate the high quality of COKE, the superior ToM ability of COLM, and its potential to significantly enhance social applications. We release our code and data at https://github.com/jincenziwu/COKE.",
    "CoLLaVO: Crayon Large Language and Vision mOdel": "The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) and instruction tuning drives the evolution of Vision Language Models (VLMs) towards a versatile general-purpose model. Yet, it remains unexplored whether current VLMs genuinely possess quality object-level image understanding capabilities determined from 'what objects are in the image?' or 'which object corresponds to a specified bounding box?'. Our findings reveal that the image understanding capabilities of current VLMs are strongly correlated with their zero-shot performance on vision language (VL) tasks. This suggests that prioritizing basic image understanding is crucial for VLMs to excel at VL tasks. To enhance object-level image understanding, we propose Crayon Large Language and Vision mOdel (CoLLaVO), which incorporates instruction tuning with Crayon Prompt as a new visual prompt tuning scheme based on panoptic color maps. Furthermore, we present a learning strategy of Dual QLoRA to preserve object-level image understanding without forgetting it during visual instruction tuning, thereby achieving a significant leap in numerous VL benchmarks in a zero-shot setting.",
    "Collecting High-quality Multi-modal Conversational Search Data for E-Commerce": "Continued improvement of conversational assistants in knowledge-rich domains like E-Commerce requires large volumes of realistic high-quality conversation data to power increasingly sophisticated LLM chatbots, dialogue managers, response rankers, and recommenders. The problem is worse for multi-modal interactions in realistic conversational product search and recommendation. Here, an artificial sales agent must interact intelligently with a customer using both textual and visual information, and incorporate results from external search systems, such as a product catalog. Yet, it remains an open question how to best crowd-source large-scale, naturalistic multi-modal dialogue and action data, required to train such an artificial agent. We describe our crowd-sourced task where one worker (the Buyer) plays the role of the customer, and other (the Seller) plays the role of the sales agent. We identify subtle interactions between one worker's environment and their partner's behavior mediated by workers' word choice. We find that limiting information presented to the Buyer, both in their backstory and by the Seller, improves conversation quality. We also show how conversations are improved through minimal automated Seller “coaching”. While typed and spoken messages are slightly different, the differences are not as large as frequently assumed. We plan to release our platform code and the resulting dialogues to advance research on conversational search agents.",
    "ColorSwap: A Color and Word Order Dataset for Multimodal Evaluation": "This paper introduces the ColorSwap dataset, designed to assess and improve the proficiency of multimodal models in matching objects with their colors. The dataset is comprised of 2,000 unique image-caption pairs, grouped into 1,000 examples. Each example includes a caption-image pair, along with a “color-swapped” pair. We follow the Winoground schema: the two captions in an example have the same words, but the color words have been rearranged to modify different objects. The dataset was created through a novel blend of automated caption and image generation with humans in the loop. We evaluate image-text matching (ITM) and visual language models (VLMs) and find that even the latest ones are still not robust at this task. GPT-4V and LLaVA score 72% and 42% on our main VLM metric, although they may improve with more advanced prompting techniques. On the main ITM metric, contrastive models such as CLIP and SigLIP perform close to chance (at 12% and 30%, respectively), although the non-contrastive BLIP ITM model is stronger (87%). We also find that finetuning on fewer than 2,000 examples yields significant performance gains on this out-of-distribution word-order understanding task.",
    "Combining Hierachical VAEs with LLMs for clinically meaningful timeline summarisation in social media": "We introduce a hybrid abstractive summarisation approach combining hierarchical VAEs with LLMs to produce clinically meaningful summaries from social media user timelines, appropriate for mental health monitoring. The summaries combine two different narrative points of view: (a) clinical insights in third person, generated by feeding into an LLM clinical expert-guided prompts, and importantly, (b) a temporally sensitive abstractive summary of the user's timeline in first person, generated by a novel hierarchical variational autoencoder, TH-VAE. We assess the generated summaries via automatic evaluation against expert summaries and via human evaluation with clinical experts, showing that timeline summarisation by TH-VAE results in more factual and logically coherent summaries rich in clinical utility and superior to LLM-only approaches in capturing changes over time.",
    "Comments as Natural Logic Pivots: Improve Code Generation via Comment Perspective": "Code generation aims to understand the problem description and generate corresponding code snippets, where existing works generally decompose such complex tasks into intermediate steps by prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Thought and its variants. While these studies have achieved some success, their effectiveness is highly dependent on the capabilities of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, particularly in terms of API calls, which significantly limits their practical applicability. Consequently, enhancing the code generation capabilities of small and medium-scale code LLMs without significantly increasing training costs is an appealing challenge. In this paper, we suggest that code comments are the natural logic pivot between natural language and code language and propose using comments to boost the code generation ability of code LLMs. Concretely, we propose MANGO (comMents As Natural loGic pivOts), including a comment contrastive training strategy and a corresponding logical comment decoding strategy. Experiments are performed on HumanEval and MBPP, utilizing StarCoder and WizardCoder as backbone models and encompassing model parameter sizes between 3B and 7B. The results indicate that MANGO significantly improves code pass rate based on the strong baselines. Meanwhile, the robustness of the logical comment decoding strategy is notably higher than the Chain-of-thoughts prompting.",
    "Comparing Inferential Strategies of Humans and Large Language Models in Deductive Reasoning": "Deductive reasoning plays a pivotal role in the formulation of sound and cohesive arguments. It allows individuals to draw conclusions that logically follow, given the truth value of the information provided. Recent progress in the domain of large language models (LLMs) has showcased their capability in executing deductive reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, a significant portion of research primarily assesses the accuracy of LLMs in solving such tasks, often overlooking a deeper analysis of their reasoning behavior. In this study, we draw upon principles from cognitive psychology to examine inferential strategies employed by LLMs, through a detailed evaluation of their responses to propositional logic problems. Our findings indicate that LLMs display reasoning patterns akin to those observed in humans, including strategies like supposition following or chain construction. Moreover, our research demonstrates that the architecture and scale of the model significantly affect its preferred method of reasoning, with more advanced models tending to adopt strategies more frequently than less sophisticated ones. Importantly, we assert that a model's accuracy, that is the correctness of its final conclusion, does not necessarily reflect the validity of its reasoning process. This distinction underscores the necessity for more nuanced evaluation procedures in the field.",
    "Comparing Pre-trained Human Language Models: Is it Better with Human Context as Groups, Individual Traits, or Both?": "Pre-trained language models consider the context of neighboring words and documents but lack any author context of the human generating the text. However, language depends on the author's states, traits, social, situational, and environmental attributes, collectively referred to as human context (Soni et al., 2024). Human-centered natural language processing requires incorporating human context into language models. Currently, two methods exist: pre-training with 1) group-wise attributes (e.g., over-45-year-olds) or 2) individual traits. Group attributes are simple but coarse — not all 45-year-olds write the same way — while individual traits allow for more personalized representations, but require more complex modeling and data. It is unclear which approach benefits what tasks. We compare pre-training models with human context via 1) group attributes, 2) individual users, and 3) a combined approach on five user- and document-level tasks. Our results show that there is no best approach, but that human-centered language modeling holds avenues for different methods.",
    "Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals": "Interpretability research aims to bridge the gap between empirical success and our scientific understanding of the inner workings of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing research focuses on analyzing a single mechanism, such as how models copy or recall factual knowledge. In this work, we propose a formulation of competition of mechanisms, which focuses on the interplay of multiple mechanisms instead of individual mechanisms and traces how one of them becomes dominant in the final prediction. We uncover how and where mechanisms compete within LLMs using two interpretability methods: logit inspection and attention modification. Our findings show traces of the mechanisms and their competition across various model components and reveal attention positions that effectively control the strength of certain mechanisms.",
    "Competition-Level Problems are Effective LLM Evaluators": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, yet there is ongoing debate about these abilities and the potential data contamination problem recently. This paper aims to evaluate the reasoning capacities of LLMs, specifically in solving recent competition-level programming problems in Codeforces, which are expert-crafted and unique, requiring deep understanding and robust reasoning skills. We first provide a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4's perceived zero-shot performance on this task, considering various aspects such as problems' release time, difficulties, and types of errors encountered. Surprisingly, the perceived performance of GPT-4 has experienced a cliff-like decline in problems after September 2021 consistently across all the difficulties and types of problems, which shows the potential data contamination, as well as the challenges for any existing LLM to solve unseen complex reasoning problems. We further explore various approaches such as fine-tuning, Chain-of-Thought prompting, and problem description simplification. Unfortunately, none of them is able to consistently mitigate the challenges. Through our work, we emphasize the importance of this excellent data source for assessing the genuine reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and foster the development of LLMs with stronger reasoning abilities and better generalization in the future.",
    "Complex Reasoning over Logical Queries on Commonsense Knowledge Graphs": "Event commonsense reasoning requires the ability to reason about the relationship between events, as well as infer implicit context underlying that relationship. However, data scarcity makes it challenging for language models to learn to generate commonsense inferences for contexts and questions involving interactions between complex events. To address this demand, we present COM2 (COMplex COMmonsense), a new dataset created by sampling multi-hop logical queries (e.g., the joint effect or cause of both event A and B, or the effect of the effect of event C) from an existing commonsense knowledge graph (CSKG), and verbalizing them using handcrafted rules and large language models into multiple-choice and text generation questions. Our experiments show that language models trained on COM2 exhibit significant improvements in complex reasoning ability, resulting in enhanced zero-shot performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks for question answering and generative commonsense reasoning, without expensive human annotations.",
    "Compositional Generalization with Grounded Language Models": "Grounded language models use external sources of information, such as knowledge graphs, to meet some of the general challenges associated with pre-training. By extending previous work on compositional generalization in semantic parsing, we allow for a controlled evaluation of the degree to which these models learn and generalize from patterns in knowledge graphs. We develop a procedure for generating natural language questions paired with knowledge graphs that targets different aspects of compositionality and further avoids grounding the language models in information already encoded implicitly in their weights. We evaluate existing methods for combining language models with knowledge graphs and find them to struggle with generalization to sequences of unseen lengths and to novel combinations of seen base components. While our experimental results provide some insight into the expressive power of these models, we hope our work and released datasets motivate future research on how to better combine language models with structured knowledge representations.",
    "Comprehensive Abstractive Comment Summarization with Dynamic Clustering and Chain of Thought": "Real-world news comments pose a significant challenge due to their noisy and ambiguous nature, which complicates their modeling for clustering and summarization tasks. Most previous research has predominantly focused on extractive summarization methods within specific constraints. This paper concentrates on Clustering and Abstractive Summarization of online news Comments (CASC). First, we introduce an enhanced fast clustering algorithm that maintains a dynamic similarity threshold to ensure the high density of each comment cluster being built. Moreover, we pioneer the exploration of tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) through a chain-of-thought strategy to generate summaries for each comment cluster. On the other hand, a notable challenge in CASC research is the scarcity of evaluation data. To address this problem, we design an annotation scheme and contribute a manual test suite tailored for CASC. Experimental results on the test suite demonstrate the effectiveness of our improvements to the baseline methods. In addition, the quantitative and qualitative analyses illustrate the adaptability of our approach to real-world news comment scenarios.",
    "Compromesso! Italian Many-Shot Jailbreaks Undermine the Safety of Large Language Models": "As diverse linguistic communities and users adopt large language models (LLMs), assessing their safety across languages becomes critical. Despite ongoing efforts to make LLMs safe, they can still be made to behave unsafely with jailbreaking, a technique in which models are prompted to act outside their operational guidelines. Research on LLM safety and jailbreaking, however, has so far mostly focused on English, limiting our understanding of LLM safety in other languages. We contribute towards closing this gap by investigating the effectiveness of many-shot jailbreaking, where models are prompted with unsafe demonstrations to induce unsafe behaviour, in Italian. To enable our analysis, we create a new dataset of unsafe Italian question-answer pairs. With this dataset, we identify clear safety vulnerabilities in four families of open-weight LLMs. We find that the models exhibit unsafe behaviors even when prompted with few unsafe demonstrations, and-more alarmingly- that this tendency rapidly escalates with more demonstrations.",
    "Computational Linguistics for Brain Encoding and Decoding: Principles, Practices and Beyond": "Computational linguistics (CL) has witnessed tremendous advancements in recent years, with models such as large language models demonstrating exceptional performance in various natural language processing tasks. These advancements highlight their potential to help understand brain language processing, especially through the lens of brain encoding and decoding. Brain encoding involves the mapping of linguistic stimuli to brain activity, while brain decoding is the process of reconstructing linguistic stimuli from observed brain activities.

    "Concept-aware Data Construction Improves In-context Learning of Language Models": "Many recent language models (LMs) are capable of in-context learning (ICL), manifested in the LMs' ability to perform a new task solely from a natural-language instruction. Previous work curating in-context learners assumes that ICL emerges from a vast over-parametrization or the scale of multi-task training. However, recent theoretical work attributes the ICL ability to concept-dependent training data and creates functional in-context learners even in small-scale, synthetic settings.  In this work, we practically explore this newly identified axis of ICL quality. We propose Concept-aware Training (CoAT), a framework for constructing training scenarios that make it beneficial for the LM to learn to utilize the analogical reasoning concepts from demonstrations. We find that by using CoAT, pre-trained transformers can learn to better utilize new latent concepts from demonstrations and that such ability makes ICL more robust to the functional deficiencies of the previous models. Finally, we show that concept-aware in-context learners are much more effective in in-context learning a majority of unseen tasks compared to traditional instruction tuning, and fare comparably also to previous in-context learners trained in large-scale multitask learning requiring magnitudes of more training data.",
    "ConceptMath: A Bilingual Concept-wise Benchmark for Measuring Mathematical Reasoning of Large Language Models": "This paper introduces ConceptMath, a bilingual (English and Chinese), fine-grained benchmark that evaluates concept-wise mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike traditional benchmarks that evaluate general mathematical reasoning with an average accuracy, ConceptMath systematically organizes math problems under a hierarchy of math concepts, so that mathematical reasoning can be evaluated at different granularity with concept-wise accuracies. Based on our ConceptMath, we then evaluate a broad range of LLMs, and we observe existing LLMs, though achieving high average accuracies on traditional benchmarks, exhibit significant performance variations across different math concepts and may even fail catastrophically on the most basic ones. Besides, we also introduce an efficient fine-tuning strategy to enhance the weaknesses of existing LLMs. Finally, we hope ConceptMath could guide the developers to understand the fine-grained mathematical abilities of their models and facilitate the growth of foundation models. Code is available at https://github.com/conceptmath/conceptmath.",
    "Concise and Precise Context Compression for Tool-Using Language Models": "Through reading the documentation in the context, tool-using language models can dynamically extend their capability using external tools. The cost is that we have to input lengthy documentation every time the model needs to use the tool, occupying the input window as well as slowing down the decoding process. Given the progress in general-purpose compression, soft context compression is a suitable approach to alleviate the problem. However, when compressing tool documentation, existing methods suffer from the weaknesses of key information loss (specifically, tool/parameter name errors) and difficulty in adjusting the length of compressed sequences based on documentation lengths. To address these problems, we propose two strategies for compressing tool documentation into concise and precise summary sequences for tool-using language models. 1) Selective compression strategy mitigates key information loss by deliberately retaining key information as raw text tokens. 2) Block compression strategy involves dividing tool documentation into short chunks and then employing a fixed-length compression model to achieve variable-length compression. This strategy facilitates the flexible adjustment of the compression ratio. Results on API-Bank and APIBench show that our approach reaches a performance comparable to the upper-bound baseline under up to 16x compression ratio.",
    "Conditioning LLMs with Emotion in Neural Machine Translation": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Natural Language Processing tasks, including Machine Translation (MT). In this work, we propose a novel MT pipeline that integrates emotion information extracted from a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model into LLMs to enhance translation quality. We first fine-tune five existing LLMs on the Libri-trans dataset and select the most performant model. Subsequently, we augment LLM prompts with different dimensional emotions and train the selected LLM under these different configurations. Our experiments reveal that integrating emotion information, especially arousal, into LLM prompts leads to notable improvements in translation quality.",
    "Confabulation: The Surprising Value of Large Language Model Hallucinations": "This paper presents a systematic defense of large language model (LLM) hallucinations or 'confabulations' as a potential resource instead of a categorically negative pitfall. The standard view is that confabulations are inherently problematic and AI research should eliminate this flaw. In this paper, we argue and empirically demonstrate that measurable semantic characteristics of LLM confabulations mirror a human propensity to utilize increased narrativity as a cognitive resource for sense-making and communication. In other words, it has potential value. Specifically, we analyze popular hallucination benchmarks and reveal that hallucinated outputs display increased levels of narrativity and semantic coherence relative to veridical outputs. This finding reveals a tension in our usually dismissive understandings of confabulation. It suggests, counter-intuitively, that the tendency for LLMs to confabulate may be intimately associated with a positive capacity for coherent narrative-text generation.",
    "Confidence Under the Hood: An Investigation into the Confidence-Probability Alignment in Large Language Models": "As the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes more widespread, understanding their self-evaluation of confidence in generated responses becomes increasingly important as it is integral to the reliability of the output of these models. We introduce the concept of Confidence-Probability Alignment, that connects an LLM's internal confidence, quantified by token probabilities, to the confidence conveyed in the model's response when explicitly asked about its certainty. Using various datasets and prompting techniques that encourage model introspection, we probe the alignment between models' internal and expressed confidence. These techniques encompass using structured evaluation scales to rate confidence, including answer options when prompting, and eliciting the model's confidence level for outputs it does not recognize as its own. Notably, among the models analyzed, OpenAI's GPT-4 showed the strongest confidence-probability alignment, with an average Spearman's ˆρ of 0.42, across a wide range of tasks. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts to facilitate risk assessment in the application of LLMs and to further our understanding of model trustworthiness.",
    "Conformity, Confabulation, and Impersonation: Persona Inconstancy in Multi-Agent LLM Collaboration": "This study explores the sources of instability in maintaining cultural personas and opinions within multi-agent LLM systems. Drawing on simulations of inter-cultural collaboration and debate, we analyze agents' pre- and post-discussion private responses alongside chat transcripts to assess the stability of cultural personas and the impact of opinion diversity on group outcomes. Our findings suggest that multi-agent discussions can encourage collective decisions that reflect diverse perspectives, yet this benefit is tempered by the agents' susceptibility to conformity due to perceived peer pressure and challenges in maintaining consistent personas and opinions. Counterintuitively, instructions that encourage debate in support of one's opinions increase the rate of inconstancy. Without addressing the factors we identify, the full potential of multi-agent frameworks for producing more culturally diverse AI outputs will remain untapped.",
    "Confounders in Instance Variation for the Analysis of Data Contamination": "Test contamination is a serious problem for the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) because it leads to the overestimation of their performance and a quick saturation of benchmarks, even before the actual capability is achieved. One strategy to address this issue is the (adversarial) generation of variations, by including different exemplars and different rephrasings of the questions. However, these two interventions can lead to instances that can be more difficult (accumulating on the expected loss of performance by partly removing the contamination) but also to instances that can be less difficult (cancelling the expected loss of performance), which would make contamination undetectable. Understanding these two phenomena in terms of instance difficulty is critical to determine and measure contamination. In this paper we conduct a comprehensive analysis of these two interventions on an addition task with fine-tuned LLAMA-2 models.",
    "ConSiDERS-The-Human Evaluation Framework: Rethinking Human Evaluation for Generative Large Language Models": "In this position paper, we argue that human evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs) should be a multidisciplinary undertaking that draws upon insights from disciplines such as user experience research and human behavioral psychology to ensure that the experimental design and results are reliable. The conclusions from these evaluations, thus, must consider factors such as usability, aesthetics, and cognitive biases. We highlight how cognitive biases can conflate fluent information and truthfulness, and how cognitive uncertainty affects the reliability of rating scores such as Likert. Furthermore, the evaluation should differentiate the capabilities and weaknesses of increasingly powerful large language models - which requires effective test sets. The scalability of human evaluation is also crucial to wider adoption. Hence, to design an effective human evaluation system in the age of generative NLP, we propose the ConSiDERS-The-Human evaluation framework consisting of 6 pillars - Consistency, Scoring Criteria, Differentiating, User Experience, Responsible, and Scalability.",
    "ConstitutionalExperts: Training a Mixture of Principle-based Prompts": "Large language models (LLMs) are highly capable at a variety of tasks given the right prompt, but writing one is still a difficult and tedious process. In this work, we introduce ConstitutionalExperts, a method for learning a prompt consisting of constitutional principles (i.e. rules), given a training dataset. Unlike prior methods that optimize the prompt as a single entity, our method incrementally improves the prompt by surgically editing individual principles. We also show that we can improve overall performance by learning unique prompts for different semantic regions of the training data and using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to route inputs at inference time. We compare our method to other state of the art prompt-optimization techniques across six benchmark datasets. We also investigate whether MoE improves these other techniques. Our results suggest that ConstitutionalExperts outperforms other prompt optimization techniques by 10.9% (F1) and that mixture-of-experts improves all techniques, suggesting its broad applicability.",
    "Context Length Extension via Generalized Extrapolation Scale": "Context length expansion of transformer models is considered a key challenge, especially when handling context beyond the training length during inference stage. In this paper, we propose Generalized extrapolatioN scalE (GeNE), a straightforward and effective method applied to the interpolate function of positional embeddings to achieve training short, test long. Experimental results show that GeNE notably improves long context language modeling. By randomly scaling the extrapolation ratio during the finetuning, GeNE achieves stable extrapolation on 64k contexts by training on 16k length. Further, the instruction following Llama2 model based on GeNE achieved competitive results compared with other open-source models of the same parameter scale. Our code is available at https://github.com/LhLi-QED/GeNE.",
    "Context versus Prior Knowledge in Language Models": "To answer a question, language models often need to integrate prior knowledge learned during pretraining and new information presented in context. We hypothesize that models perform this integration in a predictable way across different questions and contexts: models will rely more on prior knowledge for questions about entities (e.g., persons, places, etc.) that they are more familiar with due to higher exposure in the training corpus, and be more easily persuaded by some contexts than others. To formalize this problem, we propose two mutual information-based metrics to measure a model's dependency on a context and on its prior about an entity: first, the persuasion score of a given context represents how much a model depends on the context in its decision, and second, the susceptibility score of a given entity represents how much the model can be swayed away from its original answer distribution about an entity. We empirically test our metrics for their validity and reliability. Finally, we explore and find a relationship between the scores and the model's expected familiarity with an entity, and provide two use cases to illustrate their benefits.",
    "Context-Aware Tracking and Dynamic Introduction for Incomplete Utterance Rewriting in Extended Multi-Turn Dialogues": "Incomplete utterance rewriting (IUR) aims to reconstruct the utterance with omitted information and pronouns to be standalone and complete based on the context. The existing works predominantly focus on simple ellipsis and coreference problems in brief multi-turn dialogues. But in actual scenarios: 1) the context of the dialogues frequently comprises multiple similar candidates for ellipsis and coreference resolution, pouring to confuse. 2) the number of turns tends to be more extensive, while the content with various topics also grows more complex. This paper proposes a novel method called CAT to address these issues. In particular, we first devise a tacker model, distilled from GPT4-turbo, to adopt Context Tracking that dynamically updates a list of key phrases turn by turn, as accurate candidates for ellipsis and coreference resolution. Second, we further present the Dynamic Context Introduction mechanism to filter irrelevant preceding contexts that are not relied on by any element within the key phrase list to condense extended dialogues. Comprehensive experiments indicate that our solution provides a significant improvement over the existing baselines, and achieves state-of-the-art on three benchmarks.",
    "Contrastive Instruction Tuning": "Instruction tuning has been used as a promising approach to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) on unseen tasks. However, current LLMs exhibit limited robustness to unseen instructions, generating inconsistent outputs when the same instruction is phrased with slightly varied forms or language styles. This behavior indicates LLMs' lack of robustness to textual variations and generalizability to unseen instructions, potentially leading to trustworthiness issues. Accordingly, we propose Contrastive Instruction Tuning (COIN), which maximizes the similarity between the hidden representations of semantically equivalent instruction-instance pairs while minimizing the similarity between semantically different ones. To facilitate this approach, we augment the existing FLAN collection by paraphrasing task instructions. Experiments on the PromptBench benchmark show that COIN consistently improves LLMs' robustness to unseen instructions with variations across character, word, sentence, and semantic levels by an average of +2.5% in accuracy.",
    "Controllable Citation Sentence Generation with Language Models": "Citation generation aims to generate a citation sentence that refers to a chosen paper in the context of a manuscript. However, a rigid citation generation process is at odds with an author's desire to control specific attributes, such as 1) the citation intent, e.g., either introducing background information or comparing results, and 2) keywords that should appear in the citation text. To provide these degrees of controllability during citation generation, we propose to integrate the manuscript context, the context of the referenced paper, and the desired control attributes into a structured template and use it to fine-tune a language model (LM) via next-token prediction. We then utilize Proximal Policy Optimization to directly optimize the LM in favor of a high score of our proposed controllability metric. The proposed workflow harmoniously combines citation attribute suggestion and conditional citation generation into one LM, allowing for better user control.",
    "Controllable Data Augmentation for Few-Shot Text Mining with Chain-of-Thought Attribute Manipulation": "Prompting large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation has recently become a common practice in few-shot NLP tasks. In this paper, we propose Chain-of-Thought Attribute Manipulation (CoTAM), a novel approach that generates new data from existing examples by only tweaking in the user-provided, task-specific attribute, e.g., sentiment polarity or topic in movie reviews. Instead of conventional latent representation controlling, we leverage the chain-of-thought prompting to directly edit the text in three steps, (1) attribute decomposition, (2) manipulation proposal, and (3) sentence reconstruction. Extensive results on various tasks, such as text (pair) classification, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and conditional text generation, verify the superiority of CoTAM over other LLM-based augmentation methods with the same number of training examples for both fine-tuning and in-context learning. Remarkably, the 2D visualization of the augmented dataset using principal component analysis revealed a human-recognizable decision boundary that is likely hinted by the attribute manipulation, demonstrating the potential of our proposed approach.",
    "Controllable Text Generation with Residual Memory Transformer": "Large-scale Causal Language Models (CLMs), e.g., GPT3 and ChatGPT, have brought great success in text generation. However, it is still an open challenge to effectively control the generation process of a CLM while balancing the flexibility, control granularity, and generation efficiency. In this paper, we provide a new alternative for controllable text generation (CTG), by designing a non-intrusive, lightweight control plugin, namely Residual Memory Transformer (RMT), to accompany the generation of CLM at arbitrary time steps. With an encoder-decoder setup, RMT can accept any types of control conditions and cooperate with the base CLM through a residual learning paradigm, to achieve a more flexible, general, and efficient CTG. Extensive experiments are carried out on various control tasks, in the form of both automatic and human evaluations. The results demonstrate the superiority of RMT over a wide range of state-of-the-art CTG approaches.",
    "Controlled Text Generation for Black-box Language Models via Score-based Progressive Editor": "Controlled text generation is very important for the practical use of language models because it ensures that the produced text includes only the desired attributes from a specific domain or dataset. Existing methods, however, are inapplicable to black-box models or suffer a significant trade-off between controlling the generated text and maintaining its fluency. This paper introduces the Score-based Progressive Editor (ScoPE), a novel approach designed to overcome these issues. ScoPE modifies the context at the token level during the generation process of a backbone language model. This modification guides the subsequent text to naturally include the target attributes. To facilitate this process, ScoPE employs a training objective that maximizes a target score, thoroughly considering both the ability to guide the text and its fluency. Experimental results on diverse controlled generation tasks demonstrate that ScoPE can effectively regulate the attributes of the generated text while fully utilizing the capability of the backbone large language models. Our codes are available at https://github.com/ysw1021/ScoPE.",
    "Controlled Text Generation for Large Language Model with Dynamic Attribute Graphs": "Controlled Text Generation (CTG) aims to produce texts that exhibit specific desired attributes. In this study, we introduce a pluggable CTG framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) named Dynamic Attribute Graphs-based controlled text generation (DATG). This framework utilizes an attribute scorer to evaluate the attributes of sentences generated by LLMs and constructs dynamic attribute graphs. DATG modulates the occurrence of key attribute words and key anti-attribute words, achieving effective attribute control without compromising the original capabilities of the model. We conduct experiments across four datasets in two tasks: toxicity mitigation and sentiment transformation, employing five LLMs as foundational models. Our findings highlight a remarkable enhancement in control accuracy, achieving a peak improvement of 19.29% over baseline methods in the most favorable task across four datasets. Additionally, we observe a significant decrease in perplexity, markedly improving text fluency.",
    "Conversational Question Answering with Language Models Generated Reformulations over Knowledge Graph": "Conversational question answering (ConvQA) over knowledge graphs (KGs) involves answering multi-turn natural language questions about information contained in a KG. State-of-the-art methods of ConvQA often struggle with implicit question-answer pairs. These inputs are easy for human beings to understand given a conversation history, but hard for a machine to interpret, which can degrade ConvQA performance. To address this issue, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based model, CORNNET, which utilizes question reformulations generated by large language models (LLMs) to improve ConvQA performance. CORNNET adopts a teacher-student architecture where a teacher model learns question representations using human writing reformulations, and a student model to mimic the teacher model's output via reformulations generated by LLMs. The learned question representation is then used by a RL model to locate the correct answer in a KG. Extensive experimental results show that CORNNET outperforms state-of-the-art ConvQA models.",
    "CorNav: Autonomous Agent with Self-Corrected Planning for Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation": "Understanding and following natural language instructions while navigating through complex, real-world environments poses a significant challenge for general-purpose robots. These environments often include obstacles and pedestrians, making it essential for autonomous agents to possess the capability of self-corrected planning to adjust their actions based on feedback from the surroundings. However, the majority of existing vision-and-language navigation (VLN) methods primarily operate in less realistic simulator settings and do not incorporate environmental feedback into their decision-making processes. To address this gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot framework called CorNav, utilizing a large language model for decision-making and comprising two key components: 1) incorporating environmental feedback for refining future plans and adjusting its actions, and 2) multiple domain experts for parsing instructions, scene understanding, and refining predicted actions. In addition to the framework, we develop a 3D simulator that renders realistic scenarios using Unreal Engine 5. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of navigation agents in a zero-shot multi-task setting, we create a benchmark called NavBench. Our empirical study involves deploying 7 baselines across four tasks, i.e., goal-conditioned navigation given a specific object category, goal-conditioned navigation given simple instructions, finding abstract objects based on high-level instructions, and step-by-step instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CorNav consistently outperforms all baselines by a significant margin across all tasks.",
    "Could Chemical Language Models benefit from Message Passing": "Pretrained language models (LMs) showcase significant capabilities in processing molecular text, while concurrently, message passing neural networks (MPNNs) demonstrate resilience and versatility in the domain of molecular science. Despite these advancements, we find there are limited studies investigating the relationship between molecular structures and their corresponding textual representations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two strategies to evaluate whether an information integration can enhance the performance: contrast learning, which involves utilizing an MPNN to supervise the training of the LM, and fusion, which exploits information from both models. Our empirical analysis reveals that the integration approaches exhibit superior performance compared to baselines when applied to smaller molecular graphs, while these integration approaches do not yield performance enhancements on large scale graphs. Furthermore, we conduct experiments to assess the impact of dataset splitting strategies and random seeds on the overall performance.",
    "CounterCurate: Enhancing Physical and Semantic Visio-Linguistic Compositional Reasoning via Counterfactual Examples": "We propose CounterCurate, a framework to comprehensively improve the visio-linguistic compositional reasoning capability for both contrastive and generative multimodal models. In particular, we identify two critical under-explored problems: the neglect of physically grounded reasoning (counting and position understanding) and the potential of using highly capable text and image generation models for semantic counterfactual fine-tuning. Our work pioneers an approach in addressing these gaps. We first spotlight the near-chance performance of multimodal models like CLIP and LLaVA in physically grounded compositional reasoning. We then apply simple data augmentation using the grounded image generation model GLIGEN to generate fine-tuning data, resulting in significant performance improvements: +33% and +37% for CLIP and LLaVA, respectively, on our newly curated Flickr30k-Positions benchmark. Moreover, we exploit the capabilities of high-performing text generation and image generation models, specifically GPT-4V and DALLE-3, to curate challenging semantic counterfactuals, thereby further enhancing compositional reasoning capabilities on benchmarks such as SugarCrepe, where CounterCurate outperforms GPT-4V.",
    "Countering Reward Over-optimization in LLM with Demonstration-Guided Reinforcement Learning": "While reinforcement learning (RL) has been proven essential for tuning large language models (LLMs), it can lead to reward over-optimization (ROO). Existing approaches address ROO by adding KL regularization, requiring computationally expensive hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, KL regularization focuses solely on regularizing the language policy, neglecting a potential source of regularization: the reward function itself. Inspired by demonstration-guided RL, we here introduce the Reward Calibration from Demonstration (RCfD), which leverages human demonstrations and a reward model to recalibrate the reward objective. Formally, given a prompt, the RCfD objective minimizes the distance between the demonstrations' and LLM's rewards rather than directly maximizing the reward function. This objective shift avoids incentivizing the LLM to exploit the reward model and promotes more natural and diverse language generation. We show the effectiveness of RCfD on three language tasks, which achieves comparable performance to carefully tuned baselines while mitigating ROO.",
    "CPsyCoun: A Report-based Multi-turn Dialogue Reconstruction and Evaluation Framework for Chinese Psychological Counseling": "Using large language models (LLMs) to assist psychological counseling is a significant but challenging task at present. Attempts have been made on improving empathetic conversations or acting as effective assistants in the treatment with LLMs. However, the existing datasets lack consulting knowledge, resulting in LLMs lacking professional consulting competence. Moreover, how to automatically evaluate multi-turn dialogues within the counseling process remains an understudied area. To bridge the gap, we propose CPsyCoun, a report-based multi-turn dialogue reconstruction and evaluation framework for Chinese psychological counseling. To fully exploit psychological counseling reports, a two-phase approach is devised to construct high-quality dialogues while a comprehensive evaluation benchmark is developed for the effective automatic evaluation of multi-turn psychological consultations. Competitive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in psychological counseling. We open-source the datasets and model for future research.",
    "CQIL: Inference Latency Optimization with Concurrent Computation of Quasi-Independent Layers": "The fast-growing large scale language models are delivering unprecedented performance on almost all natural language processing tasks. However, the effectiveness of large language models are reliant on an exponentially increasing number of parameters. The overwhelming computation complexity incurs a high inference latency that negatively affects user experience. Existing methods to improve inference efficiency, such as tensor parallelism and quantization, target to reduce per-layer computing latency, yet overlook the cumulative latency due to the number of layers. Recent works on reducing the cumulative latency through layer removing, however, lead to significant performance drop. Motivated by the similarity of inputs among adjacent layers, we propose to identify quasi-independent layers, which can be concurrently computed to significantly decrease inference latency. We also introduce a bypassing technique to mitigate the effect of information loss. Empirical experiments of the proposed approach on the LLaMA models confirm that Concurrent Computation of Quasi-Independent Layers (CQIL) can reduce latency by up to 48.3% on LLaMA-33B, while maintaining a close level of performance.",
    "CR-LLM: A Dataset and Optimization for Concept Reasoning of Large Language Models": "Concept reasoning is an important capability for models to understand the world. However, the existing datasets, such as concept extraction and concept generation, suffer from modeledge leakage and context leakage. To address these limitations, we construct a dataset of concept reasoning for large language models (CR-LLM) with modeledge leakage prevention and context leakage prevention, which consists of 2,167 samples and covers different concept types. In addition, we propose a hybrid reasoning method, consisting of inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning and a controller. This method allows large language models to adaptively select the optimal reasoning method for each input sample. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on CR-LLM using different models and methods. The results show that existing large language models and reasoning methods perform sub-optimally in the concept reasoning task. In contrast, our proposed method significantly improves the capabilities, achieving a 7% increase in accuracy compared to CoT and demonstrating better granularity. We release CR-LLM and code at https://github.com/Nianqi-Li/Concept-Reasoning-for-LLMs.",
    "CR-UTP: Certified Robustness against Universal Text Perturbations on Large Language Models": "It is imperative to ensure the stability of every prediction made by a language model; that is, a language's prediction should remain consistent despite minor input variations, like word substitutions. In this paper, we investigate the problem of certifying a language model's robustness against Universal Text Perturbations (UTPs), which have been widely used in universal adversarial attacks and backdoor attacks. Existing certified robustness based on random smoothing has shown considerable promise in certifying the input-specific text perturbations (ISTPs), operating under the assumption that any random alteration of a sample's clean or adversarial words would negate the impact of sample-wise perturbations. However, with UTPs, masking only the adversarial words can eliminate the attack. A naive method is to simply increase the masking ratio and the likelihood of masking attack tokens, but it leads to a significant reduction in both certified accuracy and the certified radius due to input corruption by extensive masking. To solve this challenge, we introduce a novel approach, the superior prompt search method, designed to identify a superior prompt that maintains higher certified accuracy under extensive masking. Additionally, we theoretically motivate why ensembles are a particularly suitable choice as base prompts for random smoothing. The method is denoted by superior prompt ensembling technique. We also empirically confirm this technique, obtaining state-of-the-art results in multiple settings. These methodologies, for the first time, enable high certified accuracy against both UTPs and ISTPs. The source code of CR-UTP is available at https://github.com/UCF-ML-Research/CR-UTP.",
    "CRAFT: Extracting and Tuning Cultural Instructions from the Wild": "Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved as the foundation of various natural language processing (NLP) applications. Despite their wide use cases, their understanding of culturally-related concepts and reasoning remains limited. Meantime, there is a significant need to enhance these models' cultural reasoning capabilities, especially concerning underrepresented regions. This paper introduces a novel pipeline for extracting high-quality, culturally-related instruction tuning datasets from vast unstructured corpora. We utilize a self-instruction generation pipeline to identify cultural concepts and trigger instruction. By integrating with a general-purpose instruction tuning dataset, our model demonstrates enhanced capabilities in recognizing and understanding regional cultural nuances, thereby enhancing its reasoning capabilities. We conduct experiments across three regions: Singapore, the Philippines, and the United States, achieving performance improvement of up to 6%. Our research opens new avenues for extracting cultural instruction tuning sets directly from unstructured data, setting a precedent for future innovations in the field.",
    "Crayon: Customized On-Device LLM via Instant Adapter Blending and Edge-Server Hybrid Inference": "The customization of large language models (LLMs) for user-specified tasks gets important. However, maintaining all the customized LLMs on cloud servers incurs substantial memory and computational overheads, and uploading user data can also lead to privacy concerns. On-device LLMs can offer a promising solution by mitigating these issues. Yet, the performance of on-device LLMs is inherently constrained by the limitations of small-scaled models. To overcome these restrictions, we first propose Crayon, a novel approach for on-device LLM customization. Crayon begins by constructing a pool of diverse base adapters, and then we instantly blend them into a customized adapter without extra training. In addition, we develop a device-server hybrid inference strategy, which deftly allocates more demanding queries or non-customized tasks to a larger, more capable LLM on a server. This ensures optimal performance without sacrificing the benefits of on-device customization. We carefully craft a novel benchmark from multiple question-answer datasets, and show the efficacy of our method in the LLM customization.",
    "CRITICBENCH: Benchmarking LLMs for Critique-Correct Reasoning": "The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to critique and refine their reasoning is crucial for their application in evaluation, feedback provision, and self-improvement. This paper introduces CRITICBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess LLMs' abilities to critique and rectify their reasoning across a variety of tasks. CRITICBENCH encompasses five reasoning domains: mathematical, commonsense, symbolic, coding, and algorithmic. It compiles 15 datasets and incorporates responses from three LLM families. Utilizing CRITICBENCH, we evaluate and dissect the performance of 17 LLMs in generation, critique, and correction reasoning, i.e., GQC reasoning, and analyze the key factors affecting LLM critical reasoning. Our findings reveal: (1) a linear relationship in GQC capabilities, with critique-focused training markedly enhancing performance; (2) a task-dependent variation in critique and correction effectiveness, with logic-oriented tasks being more amenable to correction; (3) GQC knowledge inconsistencies that decrease as model size increases; and (4) an intriguing inter-model critiquing pattern, where stronger models are better at critiquing weaker ones, while weaker models can surprisingly surpass stronger ones in their self-critique. We hope these insights into the nuanced critique-correct reasoning of LLMs will foster further research in LLM critique and self-improvement.",
    "CRITIQUELLM: Towards an Informative Critique Generation Model for Evaluation of Large Language Model Generation": "Since the natural language processing (NLP) community started to make large language models (LLMs) act as a critic to evaluate the quality of generated texts, most of the existing works train a critique generation model on the evaluation data labeled by GPT-4's direct prompting. We observe that these models lack the ability to generate informative critiques in both pointwise grading and pairwise comparison especially without references. As a result, their generated critiques cannot provide fine-grained distinguishability on generated texts, causing unsatisfactory evaluation performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method called Eval-Instruct, which can first acquire pointwise grading critiques with pseudo references and then revise these critiques via multi-path prompting to obtain informative evaluation data in different tasks and settings, including pointwise grading and pairwise comparison with / without references. After fine-tuning on these data, the resulting model CRITIQUELLM is empirically shown to outperform ChatGPT and all the open-source baselines and even achieve comparable evaluation performance to GPT-4 in system-level correlations of pointwise grading. We also demonstrate that our generated critiques can act as scalable feedback to further improve the generation quality of strong LLMs like ChatGPT1.",
    "Cross-lingual Emotion Detection through Large Language Models": "This paper presents a detailed system description of our entry which finished 1st with a large lead at WASSA 2024 Task 2, focused on cross-lingual emotion detection. We utilized a combination of large language models (LLMs) and their ensembles to effectively understand and categorize emotions across different languages. Our approach not only outperformed other submissions with a large margin, but also demonstrated the strength of integrating multiple models to enhance performance. Additionally, We conducted a thorough comparison of the benefits and limitations of each model used. An error analysis is included along with suggested areas for future improvement. This paper aims to offer a clear and comprehensive understanding of advanced techniques in emotion detection, making it accessible even to those new to the field.",
    "Cross-Lingual Knowledge Editing in Large Language Models": "Knowledge editing aims to change language models' performance on several special cases (i.e., editing scope) by infusing the corresponding expected knowledge into them. With the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), knowledge editing has been shown as a promising technique to adapt LLMs to new knowledge without retraining from scratch. However, most of the previous studies neglect the multi-lingual nature of some main-stream LLMs (e.g., LLaMA, ChatGPT and GPT-4), and typically focus on monolingual scenarios, where LLMs are edited and evaluated in the same language. As a result, it is still unknown the effect of source language editing on a different target language. In this paper, we aim to figure out this cross-lingual effect in knowledge editing. Specifically, we first collect a large-scale cross-lingual synthetic dataset by translating ZsRE from English to Chinese. Then, we conduct English editing on various knowledge editing methods covering different paradigms, and evaluate their performance in Chinese, and vice versa. To give deeper analyses of the cross-lingual effect, the evaluation includes four aspects, i.e., reliability, generality, locality and portability. Furthermore, we analyze the inconsistent behaviors of the edited models and discuss their specific challenges.",
    "Cross-Modal Projection in Multimodal LLMs Doesn't Really Project": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like LLaVA and GPT-4(V) enable general-purpose conversations about images with the language modality. As off-the-shelf MLLMs may have limited capabilities on images from domains like dermatology and agriculture, they must be fine-tuned to unlock domain-specific applications. The prevalent architecture of current open-source MLLMs comprises two major modules: an image-language (cross-modal) projection network and a large language model. It is desirable to understand the roles of these two modules in modeling domain-specific visual attributes to inform the design of future models and streamline the interpretability efforts on the current models. To this end, via experiments on 4 datasets and under 2 fine-tuning settings, we find that as the MLLM is fine-tuned, it indeed gains domain-specific visual capabilities, but the updates do not lead to the projection extracting relevant domain-specific visual attributes. Our results indicate that the domain-specific visual attributes are modeled by the LLM, even when only the projection is fine-tuned. Through this study, we offer a potential reinterpretation of the role of cross-modal projections in MLLM architectures.",
    "CSCD-NS: a Chinese Spelling Check Dataset for Native Speakers": "In this paper, we present CSCD-NS, the first Chinese spelling check (CSC) dataset designed for native speakers, containing 40,000 samples from a Chinese social platform. Compared with existing CSC datasets aimed at Chinese learners, CSCD-NS is ten times larger in scale and exhibits a distinct error distribution, with a significantly higher proportion of word-level errors. To further enhance the data resource, we propose a novel method that simulates the input process through an input method, generating large-scale and high-quality pseudo data that closely resembles the actual error distribution and outperforms existing methods. Moreover, we investigate the performance of various models in this scenario, including large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. The result indicates that generative models underperform BERT-like classification models due to strict length and pronunciation constraints. The high prevalence of word-level errors also makes CSC for native speakers challenging enough, leaving substantial room for improvement.",
    "CToolEval: A Chinese Benchmark for LLM-Powered Agent Evaluation in Real-World API Interactions": "Assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as agents in decision making and operational tasks is crucial for the development of LLM-as-agent service. We propose CToolEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in the context of Chinese societal applications, featuring 398 APIs across 27 widely-used Apps (e.g., Apps for shopping, map, music, travel, etc.) that cover 14 domains. We further present an evaluation framework that simulates real-life scenarios, to facilitate the assessment of tool invocation ability of LLMs for tool learning and task completion ability for user interaction. Our extensive experiments with CToolEval evaluate 11 LLMs, revealing that while GPT-3.5-turbo excels in tool invocation, Chinese LLMs usually struggle with issues like hallucination and a lack of comprehensive tool understanding. Our findings highlight the need for further refinement in decision-making capabilities of LLMs, offering insights into bridging the gap between current functionalities and agent-level performance. To promote further research for LLMs to fully act as reliable agents in complex, real-world situations, we release our data and codes at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/CToolEval.",
    "Ctyun AI at BioLaySumm: Enhancing Lay Summaries of Biomedical Articles Through Large Language Models and Data Augmentation": "Lay summaries play a crucial role in making scientific research accessible to a wider audience. However, generating lay summaries from lengthy articles poses significant challenges. We consider two approaches to address this issue: Hard Truncation, which preserves the most informative initial portion of the article, and Text Chunking, which segments articles into smaller, manageable chunks. Our workflow encompasses data preprocessing, augmentation, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning large language models. We explore the influence of pretrained model selection, inference prompt design, and hyperparameter tuning on summarization performance. Our methods demonstrate effectiveness in generating high-quality, informative lay summaries, achieving the second-best performance in the BioLaySumm shared task at BioNLP 2024.",
    "CTYUN-AI@SMM4H-2024: Knowledge Extension Makes Expert Models": "This paper explores the potential of social media as a rich source of data for understanding public health trends and behaviors, particularly focusing on emotional well-being and the impact of environmental factors. We employed large language models (LLMs) and developed a suite of knowledge extension techniques to analyze social media content related to mental health issues, specifically examining 1) effects of outdoor spaces on social anxiety symptoms in Reddit, 2) tweets reporting children's medical disorders, and 3) self-reported ages in posts of Twitter and Reddit. Our knowledge extension approach encompasses both supervised data (i.e., sample augmentation and cross-task fine-tuning) and unsupervised data (i.e., knowledge distillation and cross-task pretraining), tackling the inherent challenges of sample imbalance and informality of social media language. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by the superior performance across multiple tasks (i.e., Task 3, 5 and 6) at the SMM4H-2024. Notably, we achieved the best performance in all three tasks, underscoring the utility of our models in real-world applications.",
    "CUFE at NADI 2024 shared task: Fine-Tuning Llama-3 To Translate From Arabic Dialects To Modern Standard Arabic": "LLMs such as GPT-4 and LLaMA excel in multiple natural language processing tasks, however, LLMs face challenges in delivering satisfactory performance on low-resource languages due to limited availability of training data. In this paper, LLaMA-3 with 8 Billion parameters is finetuned to translate among Egyptian, Emirati, Jordanian, Palestinian Arabic dialects, and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). In the NADI 2024 Task on DA-MSA Machine Translation, the proposed method achieved a BLEU score of 21.44 when it was fine-tuned on the development dataset of the NADI 2024 Task on DA-MSA and a BLEU score of 16.09 when trained when it was fine-tuned using the OS-ACT dataset.",
    "CUFE at StanceEval2024: Arabic Stance Detection with Fine-Tuned Llama-3 Model": "In NLP, stance detection identifies a writer's position or viewpoint on a particular topic or entity from their text and social media activity, which includes preferences and relationships. Researchers have been exploring techniques and approaches to develop effective stance detection systems. Large language models' latest advancements offer a more effective solution to the stance detection problem. This paper proposes fine-tuning the newly released 8B-parameter Llama 3 model from Meta GenAI for Arabic text stance detection. The proposed method achieved a Macro average F1 score of 0.7647 in the StanceEval 2024 Task on stance detection in Arabic language (Alturayeif et al., 2024).",
    "Cutting Off the Head Ends the Conflict: A Mechanism for Interpreting and Mitigating Knowledge Conflicts in Language Models": "Recently, retrieval augmentation and tool augmentation have demonstrated a remarkable capability to expand the internal memory boundaries of language models (LMs) by providing external context. However, internal memory and external context inevitably clash, leading to knowledge conflicts within LMs. In this paper, we aim to interpret the mechanism of knowledge conflicts through the lens of information flow, and then mitigate conflicts by precise interventions at the pivotal point. We find there are some attention heads with opposite effects in the later layers, where memory heads can recall knowledge from internal memory, and context heads can retrieve knowledge from external context. Moreover, we reveal that the pivotal point at which knowledge conflicts emerge in LMs is the integration of inconsistent information flows by memory heads and context heads. Inspired by the insights, we propose a novel method called Pruning Head via PatH Patching (PH3), which can efficiently mitigate knowledge conflicts by pruning conflicting attention heads without updating model parameters. PH3 can flexibly control eight LMs to use internal memory (↑44.0%) or external context (↑38.5%). Moreover, PH3 can also improve the performance of LMs on open-domain QA tasks. We also conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the cross-model, cross-relation, and cross-format generalization of our method.",
    "CycleAlign: Iterative Distillation from Black-box LLM to White-box Models for Better Human Alignment": "Language models trained on large-scale corpus often generate harmful responses that are harmful and contrary to human values. A prevalent approach for human alignment is reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), utilizing algorithms such as proximal policy optimization (PPO). However, these methods are often characterized by complexity, instability, and substantial resource consumption. Considering that existing large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are already relatively well-aligned and cost-friendly, researchers propose to align the language model with human preferences from AI feedback. Nevertheless, the common practices, that unidirectionally distill the responses, are constrained by the inherent capability of LLMs. To address it, we introduce CycleAlign, a framework that distills alignment capabilities from the parameter-invisible LLMs (black-box) to the parameter-visible models (white-box) in an iterative manner. CycleAlign iteratively improves both the white-box and black-box models by integrating static and dynamic in-context learning and a belief alignment method. Empirical results illustrate that the model fine-tuned by CycleAlign remarkably exceeds existing methods, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in alignment with human value.",
    "D2LLM: Decomposed and Distilled Large Language Models for Semantic Search": "The key challenge in semantic search is to create models that are both accurate and efficient in pinpointing relevant sentences for queries. While BERT-style bi-encoders excel in efficiency with pre-computed embeddings, they often miss subtle nuances in search tasks. Conversely, GPT-style LLMs with cross-encoder designs capture these nuances but are computationally intensive, hindering real-time applications. In this paper, we present D2LLMs—Decomposed and Distilled LLMs for semantic search—that combines the best of both worlds. We decompose a cross-encoder into an efficient bi-encoder integrated with Pooling by Multihead Attention and an Interaction Emulation Module, achieving nuanced understanding and pre-computability. Knowledge from the LLM is distilled into this model using contrastive, rank, and feature imitation techniques. Our experiments show that D2LLM surpasses five leading baselines in terms of all metrics across three tasks, particularly improving NLI task performance by at least 6.45%. The source code is available at https://github.com/codefuse-ai/D2LLM.",
    "DADA: Distribution-Aware Domain Adaptation of PLMs for Information Retrieval": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) exhibit promising retrieval performance in various domains. However, they struggle in domains unseen during training, since the word distribution can shift significantly. To remedy this, GPL, a generative domain adaptation (DA) method, was proposed to generate pseudo queries and labels for documents in unseen domains to further train the retriever model. However, the pseudo queries often do not resemble real queries from the target domains, as they do not integrate the domain's distributional information. We propose Distribution-Aware Domain Adaptation (DADA) to guide the model to incorporate the term distributions at both the document-level and the corpus-level, which we refer to as observation-level and domain-level feedback, respectively. Empirical results on five distinct datasets demonstrate that our method effectively adapts the model to target domains and expands document representation to unseen gold query terms.",
    "DAFNet: Dynamic Auxiliary Fusion for Sequential Model Editing in Large Language Models": "Recently, while large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results, they still suffer from hallucination, i.e., the generation of false information. Model editing is the task of fixing factual mistakes in LLMs; yet, most previous works treat it as a one-time task, paying little attention to ever-emerging mistakes generated by LLMs. We address the task of sequential model editing (SME) that aims to rectify mistakes continuously. A Dynamic Auxiliary Fusion Network (DAFNet) is designed to enhance the semantic interaction among the factual knowledge within the entire sequence, preventing catastrophic forgetting during the editing process of multiple knowledge triples. Specifically, (1) for semantic fusion within a relation triple, we aggregate the intra-editing attention flow into auto-regressive self-attention with token-level granularity in LLMs. We further leverage multi-layer diagonal inter-editing attention flow to update the weighted representations of the entire sequence-level granularity. (2) Considering that auxiliary parameters are required to store the knowledge for sequential editing, we construct a new dataset named DAFSet, fulfilling recent, popular, long-tail and robust properties to enhance the generality of sequential editing. Experiments show DAFNet significantly outperforms strong baselines in single-turn and sequential editing. The usage of DAFSet also consistently improves the performance of other auxiliary network-based methods in various scenarios.",
    "Dallah: A Dialect-Aware Multimodal Large Language Model for Arabic": "Recent advancements have significantly enhanced the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in generating and understanding image-to-text content. Despite these successes, progress is predominantly limited to English due to the scarcity of high-quality multimodal resources in other languages. This limitation impedes the development of competitive models in languages such as Arabic. To alleviate this situation, we introduce an efficient Arabic multimodal assistant, dubbed Dallah, that utilizes an advanced language model based on LLaMA-2 to facilitate multimodal interactions. Dallah demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in Arabic MLLMs. Through fine-tuning six Arabic dialects, Dallah showcases its capability to handle complex dialectal interactions incorporating both textual and visual elements. The model excels in two benchmark tests: one evaluating its performance on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and another specifically designed to assess dialectal responses. Beyond its robust performance in multimodal interaction tasks, Dallah has the potential to pave the way for further development of dialect-aware Arabic MLLMs.",
    "DARA: Decomposition-Alignment-Reasoning Autonomous Language Agent for Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs": "Answering Questions over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA) is key to well-functioning autonomous language agents in various real-life applications. To improve the neural-symbolic reasoning capabilities of language agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) in KGQA, we propose the Decomposition-Alignment-Reasoning Agent (DARA) framework. DARA effectively parses questions into formal queries through a dual mechanism: high-level iterative task decomposition and low-level task grounding. Importantly, DARA can be efficiently trained with a small number of high-quality reasoning trajectories. Our experimental results demonstrate that DARA fine-tuned on LLMs (e.g. Llama-2-7B, Mistral) outperforms both in-context learning-based agents with GPT-4 and alternative fine-tuned agents, across different benchmarks in zero-shot evaluation. This makes such models more accessible for real-life applications. We also show that DARA attains performance comparable to state-of-the-art enumerating-and-ranking-based methods for KGQA.",
    "Data Augmentation using LLMs: Data Perspectives, Learning Paradigms and Challenges": "In the rapidly evolving field of large language models (LLMs), data augmentation (DA) has emerged as a pivotal technique for enhancing model performance by diversifying training examples without the need for additional data collection. This survey explores the transformative impact of LLMs on DA, particularly addressing the unique challenges and opportunities they present in the context of natural language processing (NLP) and beyond. From both data and learning perspectives, we examine various strategies that utilize LLMs for data augmentation, including a novel exploration of learning paradigms where LLM-generated data is used for diverse forms of further training. Additionally, this paper highlights the primary open challenges faced in this domain, ranging from controllable data augmentation to multi-modal data augmentation. This survey highlights a paradigm shift introduced by LLMs in DA, and aims to serve as a comprehensive guide for researchers and practitioners.",
    "Data Contamination Calibration for Black-box LLMs": "The rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) are tightly associated with the expansion of the training data size. However, the unchecked ultra-large-scale training sets introduce a series of potential risks like data contamination, i.e. the benchmark data is used for training. In this work, we propose a holistic method named Polarized Augment Calibration (PAC) along with a brand-new dataset named StackMIA to help detect the contaminated data and diminish the contamination effect. PAC extends the popular MIA (Membership Inference Attack) — from the machine learning community — by forming a more global target for detecting training data to clarify invisible training data. As a pioneering work, PAC is very much plug-and-play that can be integrated with most (if not all) current white- and black-box (for the first time) LLMs. By extensive experiments, PAC outperforms existing methods by at least 4.5%, in data contamination detection on more than 4 dataset formats, with more than 10 base LLMs. Besides, our application in real-world scenarios highlights the prominent presence of contamination and related issues.",
    "Data-Centric Explainable Debiasing for Improving Fairness in Pre-trained Language Models": "Human-like social bias of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on downstream tasks have attracted increasing attention. The potential flaws in the training data are the main factor that causes unfairness in PLMs. Existing data-centric debiasing strategies mainly leverage explicit bias words (defined as sensitive attribute words specific to demographic groups) for counterfactual data augmentation to balance the training data. However, they lack consideration of implicit bias words potentially associated with explicit bias words in complex distribution data, which indirectly harms the fairness of PLMs. To this end, we propose a Data-Centric Debiasing method (named Data-Debias), which uses an explainability method to search for implicit bias words to assist in debiasing PLMs. Specifically, we compute the feature attributions of all tokens using the Integrated Gradients method, and then treat the tokens that have a large impact on the model's decision as implicit bias words. To make the search results more precise, we iteratively train a biased model to amplify the bias with each iteration. Finally, we use the implicit bias words searched in the last iteration to assist in debiasing PLMs. Extensive experimental results on multiple PLMs debiasing on three different classification tasks demonstrate that Data-Debias achieves state-of-the-art debiasing performance and strong generalization while maintaining predictive abilities.",
    "DataDreamer: A Tool for Synthetic Data Generation and Reproducible LLM Workflows": "Large language models (LLMs) have become a dominant and important tool for NLP researchers in a wide range of tasks. Today, many researchers use LLMs in synthetic data generation, task evaluation, fine-tuning, distillation, and other model-in-the-loop research workflows. However, challenges arise when using these models that stem from their scale, their closed source nature, and the lack of standardized tooling for these new and emerging workflows. The rapid rise to prominence of these models and these unique challenges has had immediate adverse impacts on open science and on the reproducibility of work that uses them. In this ACL 2024 theme track paper, we introduce DataDreamer, an open source Python library that allows researchers to write simple code to implement powerful LLM workflows. DataDreamer also helps researchers adhere to best practices that we propose to encourage open science and reproducibility. The library and documentation are available at: https://github.com/datadreamer-dev/DataDreamer.",
    "DB-LLM: Accurate Dual-Binarization for Efficient LLMs": "Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, while the expensive memory and computation consumption impede their practical deployment. Quantization emerges as one of the most effective methods for improving the computational efficiency of LLMs. However, existing ultra-low-bit quantization always causes severe accuracy drops. In this paper, we empirically investigate the micro and macro characteristics of ultra-low bit quantization and present a novel Dual-Binarization method for LLMs, namely DB-LLM. For the micro-level, we take both the accuracy advantage of 2-bit-width and the efficiency advantage of binarization into account, introducing Flexible Dual Binarization (FDB). By splitting 2-bit quantized weights into two independent sets of binaries, FDB ensures the accuracy of representations and introduces flexibility, utilizing the efficient bitwise operations of binarization while retaining the inherent high sparsity of ultra-low bit quantization. For the macro-level, we find the distortion that exists in the prediction of LLM after quantization, which is specified as the deviations related to the ambiguity of samples. We propose the Deviation-Aware Distillation (DAD) method, enabling the model to focus differently on various samples. Comprehensive experiments show that our DB-LLM not only significantly surpasses the current State-of-The-Art (SoTA) in ultra-low bit quantization (e.g., perplexity decreased from 9.64 to 7.23), but also achieves an additional 20% reduction in computational consumption compared to the SOTA method under the same bit-width. Our code is available at https://github.com/Hong-Chen/DB-LLM.",
    "DBQR-QA: A Question Answering Dataset on a Hybrid of Database Querying and Reasoning": "This paper introduces the Database Querying and Reasoning Dataset for Question Answering (DBQR-QA), aimed at addressing the gap in current question-answering (QA) research by emphasizing the essential processes of database querying and reasoning to answer questions. Specifically designed to accommodate sequential questions and multi-hop queries, DBQR-QA more accurately mirrors the dynamics of real-world information retrieval and analysis, with a particular focus on the financial reports of US companies. The dataset's construction, the challenges encountered during its development, the performance of large language models on this dataset, and a human evaluation are thoroughly discussed to illustrate the dataset's complexity and highlight future research directions in querying and reasoning tasks.",
    "DDPrompt: Differential Diversity Prompting in Large Language Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their reasoning ability could be enhanced through approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, these methods use single prompts for different types of questions and do not design appropriate prompts for questions with different characteristics. In this paper, we aim to explore a methodology that generates differentially diverse reasoning paths for different types of questions. To achieve this, we propose a novel prompting strategy called Differential Diversity Prompting (DDPrompt). Firstly, we generate the optimal prompts collection based on question characteristics. Then, we use this optimal prompt collection to generate multiple answers for a question and choose the final answer by voting. We evaluated DDPrompt on twelve reasoning benchmarks and significant improvement in the performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K 75% →84%, Tracking Shuffled Objects (68.8% →83.9%)).",
    "DeakinNLP at BioLaySumm: Evaluating Fine-tuning Longformer and GPT-4 Prompting for Biomedical Lay Summarization": "This paper presents our approaches for the BioLaySumm 2024 Shared Task. We evaluate two methods for generating lay summaries based on biomedical articles: (1) fine-tuning the Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED) model, and (2) zero-shot and few-shot prompting on GPT-4. In the fine-tuning approach, we individually fine-tune the LED model using two datasets: PLOS and eLife. This process is conducted under two different settings: one utilizing 50% of the training dataset, and the other utilizing the entire 100% of the training dataset. We compare the results of both methods with GPT-4 in zero-shot and few-shot prompting. The experiment results demonstrate that fine-tuning with 100% of the training data achieves better performance than prompting with GPT-4. However, under data scarcity circumstances, prompting GPT-4 seems to be a better solution.",
    "Debatrix: Multi-dimensional Debate Judge with Iterative Chronological Analysis Based on LLM": "How can we construct an automated debate judge to evaluate an extensive, vibrant, multi-turn debate? This task is challenging, as judging a debate involves grappling with lengthy texts, intricate argument relationships, and multi-dimensional assessments. At the same time, current research mainly focuses on short dialogues, rarely touching upon the evaluation of an entire debate. In this paper, by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose Debatrix, which makes the analysis and assessment of multi-turn debates more aligned with majority preferences. Specifically, Debatrix features a vertical, iterative chronological analysis and a horizontal, multi-dimensional evaluation collaboration. To align with real-world debate scenarios, we introduced the PanelBench benchmark, comparing our system's performance to actual debate outcomes. The findings indicate a notable enhancement over directly using LLMs for debate evaluation. Source code and benchmark data are available at https://github.com/ljcleo/debatrix.",
    "Debiasing In-Context Learning by Instructing LLMs": "In-context learning(ICL) has gained considerable attention due to its data efficiency and task adaptability. Unfortunately, ICL suffers from the demonstration bias, i.e., its performance and robustness are severely affected by the selection and ordering of demonstrations. In this paper, we identify that such demonstration bias may primarily stem from the semantic ambiguity induced by demonstrations, i.e., a demonstration may indicate multiple input-to-label mappings and its mapping can be interpreted differently in different contexts by LLMs. Such semantic ambiguity disrupts task comprehension during ICL and results in performance fluctuations. To resolve the semantic ambiguity problem, this paper further proposes two de-biasing strategies to mitigate demonstration bias in in-context learning. Experiments on six datasets show that our methods can effectively alleviate demonstration bias and significantly improve task performance.",
    "Debiasing Large Language Models with Structured Knowledge": "Due to biases inherently present in data for pre-training, current pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) also ubiquitously manifest the same phenomena. Since the bias influences the output from the LLMs across various tasks, the widespread deployment of the LLMs is hampered. We propose a simple method that utilizes structured knowledge to alleviate this issue, aiming to reduce the bias embedded within the LLMs and ensuring they have an encompassing perspective when used in applications. Experimental results indicated that our method has good debiasing ability when applied to existing both autoregressive and masked language models. Additionally, it could ensure that the performances of LLMs on downstream tasks remain uncompromised. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in the debiasing ability. Importantly, our method obviates the need for training from scratch, thus offering enhanced scalability and cost-effectiveness.",
    "Debug like a Human: A Large Language Model Debugger via Verifying Runtime Execution Step by Step": "Large language models (LLMs) are leading significant progress in code generation. Beyond one-pass code generation, recent works further integrate unit tests and program verifiers into LLMs to iteratively refine the generated programs. However, these works consider the generated program as an indivisible entity, which falls short for LLMs in debugging the programs, especially when the programs contain complex logic flows and data operations. In contrast, when human developers debug programs, they typically set breakpoints and selectively examine runtime execution information. The execution flow and the intermediate variables play a crucial role in the debugging process, yet they are underutilized in the existing literature on code generation. In this study, we introduce Large Language Model Debugger (LDB), a novel debugging framework that enables LLMs to refine their generated programs with the runtime execution information. Specifically, LDB segments programs into basic blocks and tracks the values of intermediate variables after each block throughout runtime execution. This allows LLMs to concentrate on simpler code units within the overall execution flow, verify their correctness against the task description block by block, and effectively pinpoint any potential errors. Experiments demonstrate that LDB consistently enhances the baseline performance by up to 9.8% across the HumanEval, MBPP, and TransCoder benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in code debugging for various LLM selections.",
    "DebugBench: Evaluating Debugging Capability of Large Language Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional coding capability. However, as another critical component of programming proficiency, the debugging capability of LLMs remains relatively unexplored. Previous evaluations of LLMs' debugging ability are significantly limited by the risk of data leakage, the scale of the dataset, and the variety of tested bugs. To overcome these deficiencies, we introduce 'DebugBench', an LLM debugging benchmark consisting of 4,253 instances. It covers four major bug categories and 18 minor types in C++, Java, and Python. To construct DebugBench, we collect code snippets from the LeetCode community, implant bugs into source data with GPT-4, and assure rigorous quality checks. We evaluate two commercial and four open-source models in a zero-shot scenario. We find that (1) while closed-source models exhibit inferior debugging performance compared to humans, open-source models relatively lower pass rate scores; (2) the complexity of debugging notably fluctuates depending on the bug category; (3) incorporating runtime feedback has a clear impact on debugging performance which is not always helpful. As an extension, we also compare LLM debugging and code generation, revealing a strong correlation between them for closed-source models. These findings will benefit the development of LLMs in debugging. Our code and dataset are open-sourced via GitHub repository and Hugging Face dataset.",
    "Deciphering Digital Detectives: Understanding LLM Behaviors and Capabilities in Multi-Agent Mystery Games": "In this study, we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Jubensha, a Chinese detective role-playing game and a novel area in Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven gaming. We introduce the first dataset specifically for Jubensha, including character scripts and game rules, to foster AI agent development in this complex narrative environment. Our work also presents a unique multi-agent interaction framework using LLMs, allowing AI agents to autonomously engage in Jubensha games. To evaluate the gaming performance of these AI agents, we developed novel methods measuring their mastery of case information and reasoning skills. Furthermore, we incorporated the latest advancements in prompting engineering to enhance the agents' performance in information gathering, murderer identification, and logical reasoning. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. This work aims to offer a novel perspective on understanding LLM capabilities and establish a new benchmark for evaluating large language model-based agents.",
    "Deciphering the Impact of Pretraining Data on Large Language Models through Machine Unlearning": "Through pretraining on a corpus with various sources, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained impressive performance. However, the impact of each component of the pretraining corpus remains opaque. As a result, the organization of the pretraining corpus is still empirical and may deviate from the optimal. To address this issue, we systematically analyze the impact of 48 datasets from 5 major categories of pretraining data of LLMs and measure their impacts on LLMs using benchmarks about nine major categories of model capabilities. Our analyses provide empirical results about the contribution of multiple corpora on the performances of LLMs, along with their joint impact patterns, including complementary, orthogonal, and correlational relationships. We also identify a set of “high-impact data” such as Books that is significantly related to a set of model capabilities. These findings provide insights into the organization of data to support more efficient pretraining of LLMs.",
    "Decoding the Narratives: Analyzing Personal Drug Experiences Shared on Reddit": "Online communities such as drug-related subreddits serve as safe spaces for people who use drugs (PWUD), fostering discussions on substance use experiences, harm reduction, and addiction recovery. Users' shared narratives on these forums provide insights into the likelihood of developing a substance use disorder (SUD) and recovery potential. Our study aims to develop a multi-level, multi-label classification model to analyze online user-generated texts about substance use experiences. For this purpose, we first introduce a novel taxonomy to assess the nature of posts, including their intended connections (Inquisition or Disclosure), subjects (e.g., Recovery, Dependency), and specific objectives (e.g., Relapse, Quality, Safety). Using various multi-label classification algorithms on a set of annotated data, we show that GPT-4, when prompted with instructions, definitions, and examples, outperformed all other models. We apply this model to label an additional 1,000 posts and analyze the categories of linguistic expression used within posts in each class. Our analysis shows that topics such as Safety, Combination of Substances, and Mental Health see more disclosure, while discussions about physiological Effects focus on harm reduction. Our work enriches the understanding of PWUD's experiences and informs the broader knowledge base on SUD and drug use.",
    "Decomposing Argumentative Essay Generation via Dialectical Planning of Complex Reasoning": "Argumentative Essay Generation (AEG) is a challenging task in computational argumentation, where detailed logical reasoning and effective rhetorical skills are essential. Previous methods on argument generation typically involve planning prior to generation. However, the planning strategies in these methods overlook the exploration of the logical reasoning process. Inspired by argument structure-related theories, we propose an argumentative planning strategy for prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality essays. This strategy comprises two stages: (1) Sketch planning, which creates a rough outline of the essay, and (2) Dialectical planning, which refines the outline through critical self-reflection. Such a planning strategy enables LLMs to write argumentative essays that are more logical, diverse, and persuasive. Furthermore, due to the scarcity of existing AEG datasets, we construct three new datasets. These datasets are from two domains: exam essays and news editorials, covering both Chinese and English. Automatic and manual evaluation on four datasets show that our method can generate more dialectical and persuasive essays with higher diversity compared to several strong baselines.",
    "Decomposition for Enhancing Attention: Improving LLM-based Text-to-SQL through Workflow Paradigm": "In-context learning of large-language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success in the field of natural language processing, while extensive case studies reveal that the single-step chain-of-thought prompting approach faces challenges such as attention diffusion and inadequate performance in complex tasks like text-to-SQL. To improve the contextual learning capabilities of LLMs in text-to-SQL, a workflow paradigm method is proposed, aiming to enhance the attention and problem-solving scope of LLMs through decomposition. Specifically, the information determination module for eliminating redundant information and the brand-new prompt structure based on problem classification greatly enhance the model's attention. Additionally, the inclusion of self-correction and active learning modules greatly expands the problem-solving scope of LLMs, hence improving the upper limit of LLM-based approaches. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms other methods by a significant margin. About 2-3 percentage point improvements compared to the existing baseline on the Spider Dev, Spider-Realistic, and Bird Dev datasets and new SOTA results on the Spider Test dataset are achieved.",
    "Deconstructing Classifiers: Towards A Data Reconstruction Attack Against Text Classification Models": "Natural language processing (NLP) models have become increasingly popular in real-world applications, such as text classification. However, they are vulnerable to privacy attacks, including data reconstruction attacks that aim to extract the data used to train the model. Most previous studies on data reconstruction attacks have focused on LLM, while classification models were assumed to be more secure. In this work, we propose a new targeted data reconstruction attack called the Mix And Match attack, which takes advantage of the fact that most classification models are based on LLM. The Mix And Match attack uses the base model of the target model to generate candidate tokens and then prunes them using the classification head. We extensively demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack using both random and organic canaries. This work highlights the importance of considering the privacy risks associated with data reconstruction attacks in classification models and offers insights into possible leakages.",
    "DeCoT: Debiasing Chain-of-Thought for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks in Large Language Models via Causal Intervention": "Large language models (LLMs) often require task-relevant knowledge to augment their internal knowledge through prompts. However, simply injecting external knowledge into prompts does not guarantee that LLMs can identify and use relevant information in the prompts to conduct chain-of-thought reasoning, especially when the LLM's internal knowledge is derived from biased information on the pretraining data. In this paper, we propose a novel causal view to formally explain the internal knowledge bias of LLMs via a Structural Causal Model (SCM). We review the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting from a causal perspective, and discover that the biased information from pretrained models can impair LLMs' reasoning abilities. When the CoT reasoning paths are misled by irrelevant information from prompts and are logically incorrect, simply editing factual information is insufficient to reach the correct answer. To estimate the confounding effect on CoT reasoning in LLMs, we use external knowledge as an instrumental variable. We further introduce CoT as a mediator to conduct front-door adjustment and generate logically correct CoTs where the spurious correlation between LLMs' pretrained knowledge and task queries is reduced. With extensive experiments, we validate that our approach enables more accurate CoT reasoning and enhances LLM generation on knowledge-intensive tasks.",
    "Deductive Closure Training of Language Models for Coherence, Accuracy, and Updatability": "While language models (LMs) can sometimes generate factually correct text and estimate truth values of individual claims, these generally do not reflect a globally coherent, manipulable model of the world. As a consequence, current LMs also generate incorrect or nonsensical content, and are difficult to edit and bring up to date. We present a method called Deductive Closure Training (DCT) that uses LMs themselves to identify implications of (and contradictions within) the text that they generate, yielding an efficient self-supervised procedure for improving LM factuality. Given a collection of seed documents, DCT prompts LMs to generate additional text implied by these documents, reason globally about the correctness of this generated text, and finally fine-tune on text inferred to be correct. Given seed documents from a trusted source, DCT provides a tool for supervised model updating; if seed documents are sampled from the LM itself, DCT enables fully unsupervised fine-tuning for improved coherence and accuracy. Across the CREAK, MQUAKE, and “Reversal Curse” datasets, supervised DCT improves LM fact verification and text generation accuracy by 3-26%; on CREAK, fully unsupervised DCT improves verification accuracy by 12%. These results show that LMs' reasoning capabilities during inference can be leveraged during training to improve their reliability.",
    "Deep-LLMADEminer: A deep learning and LLM pharmacovigilance pipeline for extraction and normalization of adverse drug event mentions on Twitter": "Adverse drug events (ADEs) pose major public health risks, with traditional reporting systems often failing to capture them. Our proposed pipeline, called Deep-LLMADEminer, used natural language processing approaches to tackle this issue for #SMM4H 2024 shared task 1. Using annotated tweets, we built a three-part pipeline: RoBERTa for classification, GPT-4-turbo for span extraction, and BioBERT for normalization. Our models achieved F1-scores of 0.838, 0.306, and 0.354, respectively, offering a novel system for Task 1 and similar pharmacovigilance tasks.",
    "DeepSeekMoE: Towards Ultimate Expert Specialization in Mixture-of-Experts Language Models": "In the era of large language models, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a promising architecture for managing computational costs when scaling up model parameters. However, conventional MoE architectures like GShard, which activate the top-K out of N experts, face challenges in ensuring expert specialization, i.e. each expert acquires non-overlapping and focused knowledge. In response, we propose the DeepSeek-MoE architecture towards ultimate expert specialization. It involves two principal strategies: (1) finely segmenting the experts into mN ones and activating mK from them, allowing for a more flexible combination of activated experts; (2) isolating Ks experts as shared ones, aiming at capturing common knowledge and mitigating redundancy in routed experts. Starting from a modest scale with 2B parameters, we demonstrate that DeepSeekMoE 2B achieves comparable performance with GShard 2.9B, which has 1.5× expert parameters and computation. In addition, DeepSeekMoE 2B nearly approaches the performance of its dense counterpart with the same number of total parameters, which sets the upper bound of MoE models. Subsequently, we scale up DeepSeekMoE to 16B parameters and show that it achieves comparable performance with DeepSeek 7B and LLaMA2 7B, with only about 40% of computations.",
    "Defending Against Alignment-Breaking Attacks via Robustly Aligned LLM": "Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advancements and are now widely used across various domains. Unfortunately, there has been a rising concern that LLMs can be misused to generate harmful or malicious content. Though a line of research has focused on aligning LLMs with human values and preventing them from producing inappropriate content, such alignments are usually vulnerable and can be bypassed by alignment-breaking attacks via adversarially optimized or handcrafted jailbreaking prompts. In this work, we introduce a Robustly Aligned LLM (RA-LLM) to defend against potential alignment-breaking attacks. RA-LLM can be directly constructed upon an existing aligned LLM with a robust alignment checking function, without requiring any expensive retraining or fine-tuning process of the original LLM. Furthermore, we also provide a theoretical analysis for RA-LLM to verify its effectiveness in defending against alignment-breaking attacks. Through real-world experiments on open-source large language models, we demonstrate that RA-LLM can successfully defend against both state-of-the-art adversarial prompts and popular handcrafted jailbreaking prompts by reducing their attack success rates from nearly 100% to around 10% or less.",
    "Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreaking Attacks Through Goal Prioritization": "While significant attention has been dedicated to exploiting weaknesses in LLMs through jailbreaking attacks, there remains a paucity of effort in defending against these attacks. We point out a pivotal factor contributing to the success of jailbreaks: the intrinsic conflict between the goals of being helpful and ensuring safety. Accordingly, we propose to integrate goal prioritization at both training and inference stages to counteract. Implementing goal prioritization during inference substantially diminishes the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of jailbreaking from 66.4% to 3.6% for ChatGPT. And integrating goal prioritization into model training reduces the ASR from 71.0% to 6.6% for Llama2-13B. Remarkably, even in scenarios where no jailbreaking samples are included during training, our approach slashes the ASR by half. Additionally, our findings reveal that while stronger LLMs face greater safety risks, they also possess a greater capacity to be steered towards defending against such attacks, both because of their stronger ability in instruction following. Our work thus contributes to the comprehension of jailbreaking attacks and defenses, and sheds light on the relationship between LLMs' capability and safety.",
    "Defending LLMs against Jailbreaking Attacks via Backtranslation": "Although many large language models (LLMs) have been trained to refuse harmful requests, they are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks which rewrite the original prompt to conceal its harmful intent. In this paper, we propose a new method for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks by “backtranslation”. Specifically, given an initial response generated by the target LLM from an input prompt, our backtranslation prompts a language model to infer an input prompt that can lead to the response. The inferred prompt is called the backtranslated prompt which tends to reveal the actual intent of the original prompt, since it is generated based on the LLM's response and not directly manipulated by the attacker. We then run the target LLM again on the backtranslated prompt, and we refuse the original prompt if the model refuses the backtranslated prompt. We explain that the proposed defense provides several benefits on its effectiveness and efficiency. We empirically demonstrate that our defense significantly outperforms the baselines, in the cases that are hard for the baselines, and our defense also has little impact on the generation quality for benign input prompts.",
    "Definition Generation for Automatically Induced Semantic Frame": "In a semantic frame resource such as FrameNet, the definition sentence of a frame is essential for humans to understand the meaning of the frame intuitively. Recently, several attempts have been made to induce semantic frames from large corpora, but the cost of creating the definition sentences for such frames is significant. In this paper, we address a new task of generating frame definitions from a set of frame-evoking words. Specifically, given a cluster of frame-evoking words and associated exemplars induced as the same semantic frame, we utilize a large language model to generate frame definitions. We demonstrate that incorporating frame element reasoning as chain-of-thought can enhance the inclusion of correct frame elements in the generated definitions.",
    "Definition generation for lexical semantic change detection": "We use contextualized word definitions generated by large language models as semantic representations in the task of diachronic lexical semantic change detection (LSCD). In short, generated definitions are used as 'senses', and the change score of a target word is retrieved by comparing their distributions in two time periods under comparison. On the material of five datasets and three languages, we show that generated definitions are indeed specific and general enough to convey a signal sufficient to rank sets of words by the degree of their semantic change over time. Our approach is on par with or outperforms prior non-supervised sense-based LSCD methods. At the same time, it preserves interpretability and allows to inspect the reasons behind a specific shift in terms of discrete definitions-as-senses. This is another step in the direction of explainable semantic change modeling.",
    "DELL: Generating Reactions and Explanations for LLM-Based Misinformation Detection": "Large language models are limited by challenges in factuality and hallucinations to be directly employed off-the-shelf for judging the veracity of news articles, where factual accuracy is paramount. In this work, we propose DELL that identifies three key stages in misinformation detection where LLMs could be incorporated as part of the pipeline: 1) LLMs could generate news reactions to represent diverse perspectives and simulate user-news interaction networks; 2) LLMs could generate explanations for proxy tasks (e.g., sentiment, stance) to enrich the contexts of news articles and produce experts specializing in various aspects of news understanding; 3) LLMs could merge task-specific experts and provide an overall prediction by incorporating the predictions and confidence scores of varying experts. Extensive experiments on seven datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that DELL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 16.8% in macro f1-score. Further analysis reveals that the generated reactions and explanations are greatly helpful in misinformation detection, while our proposed LLM-guided merging helps produce better-calibrated predictions.",
    "Deloitte at #SMM4H 2024: Can GPT-4 Detect COVID-19 Tweets Annotated by Itself?": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT-4) mark a transformative era in Natural Language Generation (NLG). These models demonstrate the ability to generate coherent text that closely resembles human-authored content. They are easily accessible and have become invaluable tools in handling various text-based tasks, such as data annotation, report generation, and question answering. In this paper, we investigate GPT-4's ability to discern between data it has annotated and data annotated by humans, specifically within the context of tweets in the medical domain. Through experimental analysis, we observe GPT-4 outperform other state-of-the-art models. The dataset used in this study was provided by the SMM4H (Social Media Mining for Health Research and Applications) shared task. Our model achieved an accuracy of 0.51, securing a second rank in the shared task.",
    "Democratizing LLMs for Low-Resource Languages by Leveraging their English Dominant Abilities with Linguistically-Diverse Prompts": "Large language models (LLMs) are known to perform tasks by simply observing few exemplars. Moreover, competent generative capabilities of LLMs are observed mostly in high-resource languages, while their performances among under-represented languages fall behind due to pre-training data imbalance. To elicit LLMs' ability onto low-resource languages without any supervised data, we propose to assemble synthetic exemplars from a diverse set of high-resource languages. These prompts can directly induce generative capabilities in low-resource languages and serve as intra-lingual exemplars to even improve tasks in these languages. Our unsupervised prompting method performs on par with supervised few-shot learning in LLMs of different sizes for translations between English and 34 Indic and African languages, and surpasses supervised prompting in non-English tasks. The method also significantly improves low-resource performances in many other intra-lingual tasks like summarization (XLSum), question answering (XQUAD & TydiQA) and conversational instruction following (Sea-Bench).",
    "Demonstration Augmentation for Zero-shot In-context Learning": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive capability known as In-context Learning (ICL), which enables them to acquire knowledge from textual demonstrations without the need for parameter updates. However, many studies have highlighted that the model's performance is sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, presenting a significant challenge for practical applications where we lack prior knowledge of user queries. Consequently, we need to construct an extensive demonstration pool and incorporate external databases to assist the model, leading to considerable time and financial costs. In light of this, some recent research has shifted focus towards zero-shot ICL, aiming to reduce the model's reliance on external information by leveraging their inherent generative capabilities. Despite the effectiveness of these approaches, the content generated by the model may be unreliable, and the generation process is time-consuming. To address these issues, we propose Demonstration Augmentation for In-context Learning (DAIL), which employs the model's previously predicted historical samples as demonstrations for subsequent ones. DAIL brings no additional inference cost and does not rely on the model's generative capabilities. Our experiments reveal that DAIL can significantly improve the model's performance over direct zero-shot inference and can even outperform few-shot ICL without any external information. Our code is available at https://github.com/yisunlp/DAIL.",
    "Demonstrations Are All You Need: Advancing Offensive Content Paraphrasing using In-Context Learning": "Paraphrasing of offensive content is a better alternative to content removal and helps improve civility in a communication environment. Supervised paraphrasers; however, rely heavily on large quantities of labelled data to help preserve meaning and intent. They also often retain a large portion of the offensiveness of the original content, which raises questions on their overall usability. In this paper we aim to assist practitioners in developing usable paraphrasers by exploring In-Context Learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs), i.e., using a limited number of input-label demonstration pairs to guide the model in generating desired outputs for specific queries. Our study focuses on key factors such as - number and order of demonstrations, exclusion of prompt instruction, and reduction in measured toxicity. We perform principled evaluation on three datasets, including our proposed Context-Aware Polite Paraphrase (CAPP) dataset, comprising of dialogue-style rude utterances, polite paraphrases, and additional dialogue context. We evaluate our approach using four closed source and one open source LLM. Our results reveal that ICL is comparable to supervised methods in generation quality, while being qualitatively better by 25% on human evaluation and attaining lower toxicity by 76%. Also, ICL-based paraphrasers only show a slight reduction in performance even with just 10% training data.",
    "Demystifying Instruction Mixing for Fine-tuning Large Language Models": "Instruction tuning significantly enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks. However, the procedure to optimizing the mixing of instruction datasets for LLM fine-tuning is still poorly understood. This study categorizes instructions into three primary types: NLP downstream tasks, coding, and general chat. We explore the effects of instruction tuning on different combinations of datasets on LLM performance, and find that certain instruction types are more advantageous for specific applications but can negatively impact other areas. This work provides insights into instruction mixtures, laying the foundations for future research.",
    "Dependency Transformer Grammars: Integrating Dependency Structures into Transformer Language Models": "Syntactic Transformer language models aim to achieve better generalization through simultaneously modeling syntax trees and sentences. While prior work has been focusing on adding constituency-based structures to Transformers, we introduce Dependency Transformer Grammars (DTGs), a new class of Transformer language model with explicit dependency-based inductive bias. DTGs simulate dependency transition systems with constrained attention patterns by modifying attention masks, incorporate the stack information through relative positional encoding, and augment dependency arc representation with a combination of token embeddings and operation embeddings. When trained on a dataset of sentences annotated with dependency trees, DTGs achieve better generalization while maintaining comparable perplexity with Transformer language model baselines. DTGs also outperform recent constituency-based models, showing that dependency can better guide Transformer language models.",
    "Design Proteins Using Large Language Models: Enhancements and Comparative Analyses": "Pre-trained LLMs have demonstrated substantial capabilities across a range of conventional natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as summarization and entity recognition. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs in the generation of high-quality protein sequences. Specifically, we adopt a suite of pre-trained LLMs, including Mistral-7B, Llama-2-7B, Llama-3-8B, and gemma-7B, to produce valid protein sequences. All of these models are publicly available. Unlike previous work in this field, our approach utilizes a relatively small dataset comprising 42,000 distinct human protein sequences. We retrain these models to process protein-related data, ensuring the generation of biologically feasible protein structures. Our findings demonstrate that even with limited data, the adapted models exhibit efficiency comparable to established protein-focused models such as ProGen varieties, ProtGPT2, and ProLLaMA, which were trained on millions of protein sequences. To validate and quantify the performance of our models, we conduct comparative analyses employing standard metrics such as pLDDT, RMSD, TM-score, and REU. Furthermore, we commit to making the trained versions of all four models publicly available, fostering greater transparency and collaboration in the field of computational biology.",
    "Designing Informative Metrics for Few-Shot Example Selection": "Pretrained language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable few-shot learning capabilities when provided with properly formatted examples. However, selecting the “best” examples remains an open challenge. We propose a complexity-based prompt selection approach for sequence tagging tasks. This approach avoids the training of a dedicated model for selection of examples, and instead uses certain metrics to align the syntactico-semantic complexity of test sentences and examples. We use both sentence- and word-level metrics to match the complexity of examples to the (test) sentence being considered. Our results demonstrate that our approach extracts greater performance from PLMs: it achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot NER, achieving a 5% absolute improvement in F1 score on the CoNLL2003 dataset for GPT-4. We also see large gains of up to 28.85 points (F1/Acc.) in smaller models like GPT-j-6B.",
    "Detecting and Mitigating LGBTQIA+ Bias in Large Norwegian Language Models": "The paper aims to detect and mitigate LGBTQIA+ bias in large language models (LLMs). As the usage of LLMs quickly increases, so does the significance of the harms they may cause due to bias. The research field of bias in LLMs has seen massive growth, but few attempts have been made to detect or mitigate other biases than gender bias, and most focus has been on English LLMs. This work shows experimentally that LLMs may cause representational harms towards LGBTQIA+ individuals when evaluated on sentence completion tasks and on a benchmark dataset constructed from stereotypes reported by the queer community of Norway, collected through a survey in order to directly involve the affected community. Furthermore, Norwegian training corpora are probed for queer bias, revealing strong associations between queer terms and anti-queer slurs, as well as words related to pedophilia. Finally, a fine-tuning-based debiasing method is applied to two Norwegian LLMs. This method does not consistently reduce bias, but shows that queer bias can be altered, laying the foundation for future debiasing approaches. By shedding light on the severe discrimination that can occur through the usage of LLMs, this paper contributes to the ongoing fight for equal rights for the LGBTQIA+ community.",
    "Detection-Correction Structure via General Language Model for Grammatical Error Correction": "Grammatical error correction (GEC) is a task dedicated to rectifying texts with minimal edits, which can be decoupled into two components: detection and correction. However, previous works have predominantly focused on direct correction, with no prior efforts to integrate both into a single model. Moreover, the exploration of the detection-correction paradigm by large language models (LLMs) remains underdeveloped. This paper introduces an integrated detection-correction structure, named DeCoGLM, based on the General Language Model (GLM). The detection phase employs a fault-tolerant detection template, while the correction phase leverages autoregressive mask infilling for localized error correction. Through the strategic organization of input tokens and modification of attention masks, we facilitate multi-task learning within a single model. Our model demonstrates competitive performance against the state-of-the-art models on English and Chinese GEC datasets. Further experiments present the effectiveness of the detection-correction structure in LLMs, suggesting a promising direction for GEC.",
    "DetermLR: Augmenting LLM-based Logical Reasoning from Indeterminacy to Determinacy": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the landscape of reasoning tasks. To enhance the capabilities of LLMs to emulate human reasoning, prior studies have focused on modeling reasoning steps using various thought structures like chains, trees, or graphs. However, LLM-based reasoning still encounters the following challenges: (1) Limited adaptability of preset structures to diverse tasks; (2) Insufficient precision in exploiting known conditions to derive new ones; and (3) Inadequate consideration of historical reasoning experiences for subsequent reasoning steps. To this end, we propose DetermLR, a novel perspective that rethinks the reasoning process as an evolution from indeterminacy to determinacy. First, we categorize known conditions into two types: determinate and indeterminate premises. This provides an overall direction for the reasoning process and guides LLMs in converting indeterminate data into progressively determinate insights. Subsequently, we leverage quantitative measurements to prioritize more relevant premises to explore new insights. Furthermore, we automate the storage and extraction of available premises and reasoning paths with reasoning memory, preserving historical reasoning details for subsequent reasoning steps. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that DetermLR surpasses all baselines on various logical reasoning benchmarks: LogiQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, PrOntoQA, and LogicalDeduction. Compared to previous multi-step reasoning methods, DetermLR achieves higher accuracy with fewer reasoning steps, highlighting its superior efficiency and effectiveness in solving logical reasoning tasks.",
    "Detoxifying Large Language Models via Knowledge Editing": "This paper investigates using knowledge editing techniques to detoxify Large Language Models (LLMs). We construct a benchmark, SafeEdit, which covers nine unsafe categories with various powerful attack prompts and equips comprehensive metrics for systematic evaluation. We conduct experiments with several knowledge editing approaches, indicating that knowledge editing has the potential to detoxify LLMs with a limited impact on general performance efficiently. Then, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed Detoxifying with Intraoperative Neural Monitoring (DINM), to diminish the toxicity of LLMs within a few tuning steps via only one instance. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the internal mechanism for various detoxifying approaches, demonstrating that previous methods like SFT and DPO may merely suppress the activations of toxic parameters, while DINM mitigates the toxicity of the toxic parameters to a certain extent, making permanent adjustments. We hope that these insights could shed light on future work of developing detoxifying approaches and the underlying knowledge mechanisms of LLMs.",
    "DevEval: A Manually-Annotated Code Generation Benchmark Aligned with Real-World Code Repositories": " How to evaluate the coding abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains an open question. We find that existing benchmarks are poorly aligned with real-world code repositories and are insufficient to evaluate the coding abilities of LLMs. To address the knowledge gap, we propose a new benchmark named DevEval, which has three advances. ❶DevEval aligns with real-world repositories in multiple dimensions, e.g., code and dependency distributions. ❷DevEval is annotated by 13 developers and contains comprehensive annotations (e.g., requirements, original repositories, reference code, and reference dependencies). ❸DevEval comprises 1,825 testing samples from 115 repositories, covering 10 popular domains (e.g., Internet, Database). Based on DevEval, we propose repository-level code generation and evaluate 8 popular LLMs on DevEval (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-3.5, StarCoder 2, DeepSeek Coder, CodeLLaMa). Our experiments reveal these LLMs' coding abilities in real-world code repositories. For example, the highest Pass@1 of gpt-4 only is 53.04% in our experiments. We also analyze LLMs' failed cases and summarize their shortcomings. We hope DevEval can facilitate the development of LLMs in real code repositories. DevEval, prompts, and LLMs' predictions have been released.",
    "Dialogue Summarization with Mixture of Experts based on Large Language Models": "Dialogue summarization is an important task that requires to generate highlights for a conversation from different aspects (e.g., content of various speakers). While several studies successfully employ large language models (LLMs) and achieve satisfying results, they are limited by using one model at a time or treat it as a black box, which makes it hard to discriminatively learn essential content in a dialogue from different aspects, therefore may lead to anticipation bias and potential loss of information in the produced summaries. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach with role-oriented routing and fusion generation to utilize mixture of experts (MoE) for dialogue summarization. Specifically, the role-oriented routing is an LLM-based module that selects appropriate experts to process different information; fusion generation is another LLM-based module to locate salient information and produce finalized dialogue summaries. The proposed approach offers an alternative solution to employing multiple LLMs for dialogue summarization by leveraging their capabilities of in-context processing and generation in an effective manner. We run experiments on widely used benchmark datasets for this task, where the results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in producing informative and accurate dialogue summarization.",
    "DictLLM: Harnessing Key-Value Data Structures with Large Language Models for Enhanced Medical Diagnostics": "Structured data offers a sophisticated mechanism for the organization of information. Existing methodologies for the text-serialization of structured data in the context of large language models fail to adequately address the heterogeneity inherent in key-value structured data. These methods are not ideal and frequently result in larger input sizes and poor adaptability to input changes. In this paper, we introduce DictLLM, an innovative framework designed to improve the modeling of key-value structured data, like medical laboratory reports, for generating medical diagnoses. DictLLM integrates three key components: (1) group positional encoding to maintain permutation invariance, (2) hierarchical attention bias to capture the inherent bias in structured data, and (3) an optimal transport alignment layer that aligns the embedding generated by the dictionary encoder with the LLM, thereby producing a sequence of fixed-length virtual tokens. We carry out experiments using various LLM models on a comprehensive real-world medical laboratory report dataset for automatic diagnosis generation, our findings illustrate that DictLLM significantly outperforms established baseline methods and few-shot GPT-4 implementations in terms of both Rouge-L and Knowledge F1 scores. Furthermore, our evaluation of the framework's scalability and robustness, through a series of experiments, underscores its exceptional capability in accurately modeling the complex key-value data structure of medical dictionary data.",
    "DiffChat: Learning to Chat with Text-to-Image Synthesis Models for Interactive Image Creation": "We present DiffChat, a novel method to align Large Language Models (LLMs) to “chat” with prompt-as-input Text-to-Image Synthesis (TIS) models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) for interactive image creation. Given a raw prompt/image and a user-specified instruction, DiffChat can effectively make appropriate modifications and generate the target prompt, which can be leveraged to create the target image of high quality. To achieve this, we first collect an instruction-following prompt engineering dataset named InstructPE for the supervised training of DiffChat. Next, we propose a reinforcement learning framework with the feedback of three core criteria for image creation, i.e., aesthetics, user preference and content integrity. It involves an action-space dynamic modification technique to obtain more relevant positive samples and harder negative samples during the off-policy sampling. Content integrity is also introduced into the value estimation function for further improvement of produced images. Our method can exhibit superior performance than baseline models and strong competitors based on both automatic and human evaluations, which fully demonstrates its effectiveness.",
    "Differentially Private Knowledge Distillation via Synthetic Text Generation": "Large Language models (LLMs) are achieving state-of-the-art performance in many different downstream tasks. However, the increasing urgency of data privacy puts pressure on practitioners to train LLMs with Differential Privacy (DP) on private data. Concurrently, the exponential growth in parameter size of LLMs necessitates model compression before deployment of LLMs on resource-constrained devices or latency-sensitive applications. Differential privacy and model compression generally must trade off utility loss to achieve their objectives. Moreover, simultaneously applying both schemes can compound the utility degradation. To this end, we propose DistilDP: a novel differentially private knowledge distillation algorithm that exploits synthetic data generated by a differentially private teacher LLM. The knowledge of a teacher LLM is transferred onto the student in two ways: one way from the synthetic data itself- the hard labels, and the other way by the output distribution of the teacher evaluated on the synthetic data- the soft labels. Furthermore, if the teacher and student share a similar architectural structure, we can further distill knowledge by aligning the hidden representations between both. Our experimental results demonstrate that DistilDP can substantially improve the utility over existing baselines, at least 9.0 PPL on the Big Patent dataset, with strong privacy parameters, ϵ = 2. These promising results progress privacy-preserving compression of autoregressive LLMs.",
    "Diffusion Guided Language Modeling": "Current language models demonstrate remarkable proficiency in text generation. However, for many applications it is desirable to control attributes, such as sentiment, or toxicity, of the generated language—ideally tailored towards each specific use case and target audience. For auto-regressive language models, existing guidance methods are prone to decoding errors that cascade during generation and degrade performance. In contrast, text diffusion models can easily be guided with, for example, a simple linear sentiment classifier—however they do suffer from significantly higher perplexity than auto-regressive alternatives. In this paper we use a guided diffusion model to produce a latent proposal that steers an auto-regressive language model to generate text with desired properties. Our model inherits the unmatched fluency of the auto-regressive approach and the plug-and-play flexibility of diffusion. We show that it outperforms previous plug-and-play guidance methods across a wide range of benchmark data sets. Further, controlling a new attribute in our framework is reduced to training a single logistic regression classifier.",
    "Digital Socrates: Evaluating LLMs through Explanation Critiques": "While LLMs can provide reasoned explanations along with their answers, the nature and quality of those explanations are still poorly understood. In response, our goal is to define a detailed way of characterizing the explanation capabilities of modern models and to create a nuanced, interpretable explanation evaluation tool that can generate such characterizations automatically, without relying on expensive API calls or human annotations. Our approach is to (a) define the new task of explanation critiquing - identifying and categorizing any main flaw in an explanation and providing suggestions to address the flaw, (b) create a sizeable, human-verified dataset for this task, and (c) train an open-source, automatic critique model (called Digital Socrates) using this data. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we demonstrate how Digital Socrates is useful for revealing insights about student models by examining their reasoning chains, and how it can provide high-quality, nuanced, automatic evaluation of those model explanations for the first time. Digital Socrates thus fills an important gap in evaluation tools for understanding and improving the explanation behavior of models.",
    "DIMSIM: Distilled Multilingual Critics for Indic Text Simpliﬁcation": "Self-correction techniques have recently emerged as a promising framework to improve the quality of responses generated by large language models (LLMs). Few-shot prompted LLMs act as critics to produce feedback for an input, which is further fed to a reﬁner (also an LLM) to produce an output. However, these critique-reﬁne steps require multiple expensive LLM calls. To circumvent this large inference cost, we borrow inspiration from prior work on knowledge distillation and propose the use of critique distillation to train critic models. These are smaller sequence-to-sequence models that are trained on input-critique pairs generated by an LLM. We focus on the problem of text simpliﬁcation for three Indian languages: Hindi, Bengali and Marathi. This task is a good ﬁt for self-correction style techniques. It also has not been systematically explored for Indian languages before. We train two separate critics that focus on lexical and structure complexity, and show that it is surprisingly more effective than using an LLM directly as a critic in both 0-shot and few-shot settings. We also show the beneﬁts of training multilingual critics, as opposed to monolingual critics. Extensive human evaluations show that on average, raters ﬁnd 80% of DIMSIM's output to be simple and easy to read.",
    "Direct Evaluation of Chain-of-Thought in Multi-hop Reasoning with Knowledge Graphs": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities when prompted to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations alongside answers. However, previous research on evaluating LLMs has solely focused on answer accuracy, neglecting the correctness of the generated CoT. In this paper, we delve deeper into the CoT reasoning capabilities of LLMs in multi-hop question answering by utilizing knowledge graphs (KGs). We propose a novel discriminative and generative CoT evaluation paradigm to assess LLMs' knowledge of reasoning and the accuracy of the generated CoT. Through experiments conducted on 5 different families of LLMs across 2 multi-hop question-answering datasets, we find that LLMs possess sufficient knowledge to perform reasoning. However, there exists a significant disparity between answer accuracy and faithfulness of the CoT generated by LLMs, indicating that they often arrive at correct answers through incorrect reasoning.",
    "Direct Large Language Model Alignment Through Self-Rewarding Contrastive Prompt Distillation": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human expectations without human-annotated preference data is an important problem. In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate the response preference by using the output probabilities of response pairs under contrastive prompt pairs, which could achieve better performance on LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA2-13B compared to RLAIF. Based on this, we propose an automatic alignment method, Direct Large Model Alignment (DLMA). First, we use contrastive prompt pairs to automatically generate preference data. Then, we continue to evaluate the generated preference data using contrastive prompt pairs and calculate a self-rewarding score. Finally, we use the DPO algorithm to effectively align LLMs by combining this self-rewarding score. In the experimental stage, our DLMA method could surpass the RLHF method without relying on human-annotated preference data. Source code is available.",
    "Direct Preference Optimization with an Offset": "Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a successful fine-tuning strategy for aligning large language models with human preferences without the need to train a reward model or employ reinforcement learning. DPO, as originally formulated, relies on binary preference data and fine-tunes a language model to increase the likelihood of a preferred response over a dispreferred response. However, not all preference pairs are equal. Sometimes, the preferred response is only slightly better than the dispreferred one. In other cases, the preference is much stronger. For instance, if a response contains harmful or toxic content, the annotator will have a strong preference for that response. In this paper, we propose a generalization of DPO, termed DPO with an offset (ODPO), that does not treat every preference pair equally during fine-tuning. Intuitively, ODPO requires the difference between the likelihood of the preferred and dispreferred response to be greater than an offset value. The offset is determined based on the extent to which one response is preferred over another. Our experiments on various tasks suggest that ODPO significantly outperforms DPO in aligning language models, especially when the number of preference pairs is limited.",
    "Discerning and Resolving Knowledge Conflicts through Adaptive Decoding with Contextual Information-Entropy Constraint": "Large language models internalize enormous parametric knowledge during pre-training. Concurrently, realistic applications necessitate external contextual knowledge to aid models on the underlying tasks. This raises a crucial dilemma known as knowledge conflicts, where the contextual knowledge clashes with the parametric knowledge. However, existing decoding works are specialized in resolving knowledge conflicts and could inadvertently deteriorate performance in absence of conflicts. In this paper, we propose an adaptive decoding method, termed as contextual information-entropy constraint decoding (COIECD), to discern whether the knowledge conflicts occur and resolve them. It can improve the model's faithfulness to conflicting context, and simultaneously maintain high performance among non-conflicting context. Our experiments show that COIECD exhibits strong performance and robustness over knowledge conflicts in realistic datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/Stacy027/COIECD.",
    "Discursive Socratic Questioning: Evaluating the Faithfulness of Language Models' Understanding of Discourse Relations": "While large language models have significantly enhanced the effectiveness of discourse relation classifications, it remains unclear whether their comprehension is faithful and reliable. We provide DISQ, a new method for evaluating the faithfulness of understanding discourse based on question answering. We first employ in-context learning to annotate the reasoning for discourse comprehension, based on the connections among key events within the discourse. Following this, DISQ interrogates the model with a sequence of questions to assess its grasp of core event relations, its resilience to counterfactual queries, as well as its consistency to its previous responses. We then evaluate language models with different architectural designs using DISQ, finding: (1) DISQ presents a significant challenge for all models, with the top-performing GPT model attaining only 41% of the ideal performance in PDTB; (2) DISQ is robust to domain shifts and paraphrase variations; (3) Open-source models generally lag behind their closed-source GPT counterparts, with notable exceptions being those enhanced with chat and code/math features; (4) Our analysis validates the effectiveness of explicitly signalled discourse connectives, the role of contextual information, and the benefits of using historical QA data.",
    "Disentangling Length from Quality in Direct Preference Optimization": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been a crucial component in the recent success of Large Language Models. However, RLHF is known to exploit biases in human preferences, such as verbosity. A well-formatted and eloquent answer is often more highly rated by users, even when it is less helpful and objective. A number of approaches have been developed to control those biases in the classical RLHF literature, but the problem remains relatively under-explored for Direct Alignment Algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike classical RLHF, DPO does not train a separate reward model or use reinforcement learning directly, so previous approaches developed to control verbosity cannot be directly applied to this setting. Our work makes several contributions. For the first time, we study the length problem in the DPO setting, showing significant exploitation in DPO and linking it to out-of-distribution bootstrapping. We then develop a principled but simple regularization strategy that prevents length exploitation while still maintaining improvements in model quality. We demonstrate these effects across datasets on summarization and dialogue, where we achieve up to 20% improvement in win rates when controlling for length, despite the GPT-4 judge's well-known verbosity bias.",
    "Disinformation Capabilities of Large Language Models": "Automated disinformation generation is often listed as an important risk associated with large language models (LLMs). The theoretical ability to flood the information space with disinformation content might have dramatic consequences for societies around the world. This paper presents a comprehensive study of the disinformation capabilities of the current generation of LLMs to generate false news articles in the English language. In our study, we evaluated the capabilities of 10 LLMs using 20 disinformation narratives. We evaluated several aspects of the LLMs: how good they are at generating news articles, how strongly they tend to agree or disagree with the disinformation narratives, how often they generate safety warnings, etc. We also evaluated the abilities of detection models to detect these articles as LLM-generated. We conclude that LLMs are able to generate convincing news articles that agree with dangerous disinformation narratives.",
    "Disperse-Then-Merge: Pushing the Limits of Instruction Tuning via Alignment Tax Reduction": "Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on instruction-following corpus is a crucial approach toward the alignment of large language models (LLMs). However, the performance of LLMs on standard knowledge and reasoning benchmarks tends to suffer from deterioration at the latter stage of the SFT process, echoing the phenomenon of alignment tax. Through our pilot study, we put a hypothesis that the data biases are probably one cause behind the phenomenon. To address the issue, we introduce a simple disperse-then-merge framework. To be concrete, we disperse the instruction-following data into portions and train multiple sub-models using different data portions. Then we merge multiple models into a single one via model merging techniques. Despite its simplicity, our framework outperforms various sophisticated methods such as data curation and training regularization on a series of standard knowledge and reasoning benchmarks.",
    "Dissecting Human and LLM Preferences": "As a relative quality comparison of model responses, human and Large Language Model (LLM) preferences serve as common alignment goals in model fine-tuning and criteria in evaluation. Yet, these preferences merely reflect broad tendencies, resulting in less explainable and controllable models with potential safety risks. In this work, we dissect the preferences of human and 32 different LLMs to understand their quantitative composition, using annotations from real-world user-model conversations for a fine-grained, scenario-wise analysis. We find that humans are less sensitive to errors, favor responses that support their stances, and show clear dislike when models admit their limits. On the contrary, advanced LLMs like GPT-4-Turbo emphasize correctness, clarity, and harmlessness more. Additionally, LLMs of similar sizes tend to exhibit similar preferences, regardless of their training methods, and fine-tuning for alignment does not significantly alter the preferences of pretrained-only LLMs. Finally, we show that preference-based evaluation can be intentionally manipulated. In both training-free and training-based settings, aligning a model with the preferences of judges boosts scores, while injecting the least preferred properties lowers them. This results in notable score shifts: up to 0.59 on MT-Bench (1-10 scale) and 31.94 on AlpacaEval 2.0 (0-100 scale), highlighting the significant impact of this strategic adaptation. We have made all resources of this project publicly available.",
    "Distillation Enhanced Generative Retrieval": "Generative retrieval is a promising new paradigm in text retrieval that generates identifier strings of relevant passages as the retrieval target. This paradigm leverages powerful generative language models, distinct from traditional sparse or dense retrieval methods. In this work, we identify a viable direction to further enhance generative retrieval via distillation and propose a feasible framework, named DGR. DGR utilizes sophisticated ranking models, such as the cross-encoder, in a teacher role to supply a passage rank list, which captures the varying relevance degrees of passages instead of binary hard labels; subsequently, DGR employs a specially designed distilled RankNet loss to optimize the generative retrieval model, considering the passage rank order provided by the teacher model as labels. This framework only requires an additional distillation step to enhance current generative retrieval systems and does not add any burden to the inference stage. We conduct experiments on four public datasets, and the results indicate that DGR achieves state-of-the-art performance among the generative retrieval methods. Additionally, DGR demonstrates exceptional robustness and generalizability with various teacher models and distillation losses. The code is released at https://github.com/liyongqi67/DGR.",
    "DistillMIKE: Editing Distillation of Massive In-Context Knowledge Editing in Large Language Models": "Among the recently emerging knowledge-editing methods, in-context knowledge editing (IKE) (Zheng et al., 2023) has shown respectable abilities in knowledge editing in terms of generalization and specificity. Noting the promising advantages but unexplored issues of IKE, we propose DistillMIKE as a novel extension of IKE, i.e., editing distillation of “Massive” In-context Knowledge Editing in large language models (LLMs), primarily consisting of two expansions: 1) Massive in-context knowledge editing (MIKE), which extends IKE to a massive editing task, aims to inject not a single edit but a set of massive edits into LLMs. To preserve specificity, our key novel extension is a “selective” retrieval augmentation, where the retrieval-augmented IKE is only applied to “in-scope” examples, whereas the unedited model without IKE is employed for “out-of-scope” ones. 2) Editing distillation of MIKE using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), which distills the editing abilities of MIKE to the parameters of LLMs in a manner that eliminates the need for lengthy in-context demonstrations, thereby removing the computational overhead encountered at the inference time. The experimental results on the zsRE and CounterFact datasets demonstrate that MIKE shows state-of-the-art performance, whereas DistilMIKE shows comparable performance to MIKE. Our code is available at https://github.com/JoveReCode/DistillMIKE.git.",
    "Diving Deep into the Motion Representation of Video-Text Models": "Videos are more informative than images because they capture the dynamics of the scene. By representing motion in videos, we can capture dynamic activities. In this work, we introduce GPT-4 generated motion descriptions that capture fine-grained motion descriptions of activities and apply them to three action datasets. We evaluated several video-text models on the task of retrieval of motion descriptions. We found that they fall far behind human expert performance on two action datasets, raising the question of whether video-text models understand motion in videos. To address it, we introduce a method of improving motion understanding in video-text models by utilizing motion descriptions. This method proves to be effective on two action datasets for the motion description retrieval task. The results draw attention to the need for quality captions involving fine-grained motion information in existing datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline in understanding fine-grained motion during video-text retrieval.",
    "DMoERM: Recipes of Mixture-of-Experts for Effective Reward Modeling": "The performance of the reward model (RM) is a critical factor in improving the effectiveness of the large language model (LLM) during alignment fine-tuning. There remain two challenges in RM training: 1) training the same RM using various categories of data may cause its generalization performance to suffer from multi-task disturbance, and 2) the human annotation consistency rate is generally only 60% to 75%, causing training data to contain a lot of noise. To tackle these two challenges, we introduced the idea of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into the field of RM for the first time. We propose the Double-Layer MoE RM (DMoERM). The outer layer MoE is a sparse model. After classifying an input into task categories, we route it to the corresponding inner layer task-specific model. The inner layer MoE is a dense model. We decompose the specific task into multiple capability dimensions and individually fine-tune a LoRA expert on each one. Their outputs are then synthesized by an MLP to compute the final rewards. To minimize costs, we call a public LLM API to obtain the capability preference labels. The validation on manually labeled datasets confirms that our model attains superior consistency with human preference and outstrips advanced generative approaches. Meanwhile, through BoN sampling and RL experiments, we demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art ensemble methods of RM and mitigates the overoptimization problem. Our code is available at: https://github.com/quanshr/DMoERM.",
    "Do Androids Know They're Only Dreaming of Electric Sheep?": "We design probes trained on the internal representations of a transformer language model to predict its hallucinatory behavior on three grounded generation tasks. To train the probes, we annotate for span-level hallucination on both sampled (organic) and manually edited (synthetic) reference outputs. Our probes are narrowly trained and we find that they are sensitive to their training domain: they generalize poorly from one task to another or from synthetic to organic hallucinations. However, on in-domain data, they can reliably detect hallucinations at many transformer layers, achieving 95% of their peak performance as early as layer 4. Here, probing proves accurate for evaluating hallucination, outperforming several contemporary baselines and even surpassing an expert human annotator in response-level detection F1. Similarly, on span-level labeling, probes are on par or better than the expert annotator on two out of three generation tasks. Overall, we find that probing is a feasible and efficient alternative to language model hallucination evaluation when model states are available.",
    "Do Clinicians Know How to Prompt? The Need for Automatic Prompt Optimization Help in Clinical Note Generation": "This study examines the effect of prompt engineering on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in clinical note generation. We introduce an Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) framework to refine initial prompts and compare the outputs of medical experts, non-medical experts, and APO-enhanced GPT3.5 and GPT4. Results highlight GPT4-APO's superior performance in standardizing prompt quality across clinical note sections. A human-in-the-loop approach shows that experts maintain content quality post-APO, with a preference for their own modifications, suggesting the value of expert customization. We recommend a two-phase optimization process, leveraging APO-GPT4 for consistency and expert input for personalization.",
    "Do Language Models Exhibit Human-like Structural Priming Effects?": "We explore which linguistic factors—at the sentence and token level—play an important role in influencing language model predictions, and investigate whether these are reflective of results found in humans and human corpora (Gries and Kootstra, 2017). We make use of the structural priming paradigm, where recent exposure to a structure facilitates processing of the same structure. We don't only investigate whether, but also where priming effects occur, and what factors predict them. We show that these effects can be explained via the inverse frequency effect, known in human priming, where rarer elements within a prime increase priming effects, as well as lexical dependence between prime and target. Our results provide an important piece in the puzzle of understanding how properties within their context affect structural prediction in language models.",
    "Do Large Language Models Discriminate in Hiring Decisions on the Basis of Race, Ethnicity, and Gender?": "We examine whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit race- and gender-based name discrimination in hiring decisions, similar to classic findings in the social sciences (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004). We design a series of templatic prompts to LLMs to write an email to a named job applicant informing them of a hiring decision. By manipulating the applicant's first name, we measure the effect of perceived race, ethnicity, and gender on the probability that the LLM generates an acceptance or rejection email. We find that the hiring decisions of LLMs in many settings are more likely to favor White applicants over Hispanic applicants. In aggregate, the groups with the highest and lowest acceptance rates respectively are masculine White names and masculine Hispanic names. However, the comparative acceptance rates by group vary under different templatic settings, suggesting that LLMs' race- and gender-sensitivity may be idiosyncratic and prompt-sensitive.",
    "Do Large Language Models have Problem-Solving Capability under Incomplete Information Scenarios?": "The evaluation of the problem-solving capability under incomplete information scenarios of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important, encompassing capabilities such as questioning, knowledge search, error detection, and path planning. Current research mainly focuses on LLMs' problem-solving capability such as “Twenty Questions”. However, these kinds of games do not require recognizing misleading cues which are necessary in the incomplete information scenario. Moreover, the existing game such as “Who is undercover” are highly subjective, making it challenging for evaluation. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel game named BrainKing based on the “Who is undercover” and “Twenty Questions” for evaluating LLM capabilities under incomplete information scenarios. It requires LLMs to identify target entities with limited yes-or-no questions and potential misleading answers. By setting up easy, medium, and hard difficulty modes, we comprehensively assess the performance of LLMs across various aspects. Our results reveal the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in BrainKing, providing significant insights of LLM problem-solving levels.",
    "Do Large Language Models Latently Perform Multi-Hop Reasoning?": "We study whether Large Language Models (LLMs) latently perform multi-hop reasoning with complex prompts such as “The mother of the singer of 'Superstition' is”. We look for evidence of a latent reasoning pathway where an LLM (1) latently identifies “the singer of 'Superstition”' as Stevie Wonder, the bridge entity, and (2) uses its knowledge of Stevie Wonder's mother to complete the prompt. We analyze these two hops individually and consider their co-occurrence as indicative of latent multi-hop reasoning. For the first hop, we test if changing the prompt to indirectly mention the bridge entity instead of any other entity increases the LLM's internal recall of the bridge entity. For the second hop, we test if increasing this recall causes the LLM to better utilize what it knows about the bridge entity. We find strong evidence of latent multi-hop reasoning for the prompts of certain relation types, with the reasoning pathway used in more than 80% of the prompts. However, the utilization is highly contextual, varying across different types of prompts. Also, on average, the evidence for the second hop and the full multi-hop traversal is rather moderate and only substantial for the first hop. Moreover, we find a clear scaling trend with increasing model size for the first hop of reasoning but not for the second hop. Our experimental findings suggest potential challenges and opportunities for future development and applications of LLMs.",
    "Do large language models resemble humans in language use?": "It is unclear whether large language models (LLMs) develop humanlike characteristics in language use. We subjected ChatGPT and Vicuna to 12 pre-registered psycholinguistic experiments ranging from sounds to dialogue. ChatGPT and Vicuna replicated the human pattern of language use in 10 and 7 out of the 12 experiments, respectively. The models associated unfamiliar words with different meanings depending on their forms, continued to access recently encountered meanings of ambiguous words, reused recent sentence structures, attributed causality as a function of verb semantics, and accessed different meanings and retrieved different words depending on an interlocutor's identity. In addition, ChatGPT, but not Vicuna, nonliterally interpreted implausible sentences that were likely to have been corrupted by noise, drew reasonable inferences, and overlooked semantic fallacies in a sentence. Finally, unlike humans, neither model preferred using shorter words to convey less informative content, nor did they use context to resolve syntactic ambiguities. We discuss how these convergences and divergences may result from the transformer architecture. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that LLMs such as ChatGPT (and Vicuna to a lesser extent) are humanlike in many aspects of human language processing.",
    "Do LLMs Agree with Humans on Emotional Associations to Nonsense Words?": "Understanding human perception of nonsense words is helpful to devise product and character names that match their characteristics. Previous studies have suggested the usefulness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for estimating such human perception, but they did not focus on its emotional aspects. Hence, this study aims to elucidate the relationship of emotions evoked by nonsense words between humans and LLMs. Using a representative LLM, GPT-4, we reproduce the procedure of an existing study to analyze evoked emotions of humans for nonsense words. A positive correlation of 0.40 was found between the emotion intensity scores reproduced by GPT-4 and those manually annotated by humans. Although the correlation is not very high, this demonstrates that GPT-4 may agree with humans on emotional associations to nonsense words. Considering that the previous study reported that the correlation among human annotators was about 0.68 on average and that between a regression model trained on the annotations for real words and humans was 0.17, GPT-4's agreement with humans is notably strong.",
    "Do LLMs Recognize me, When I is not me: Assessment of LLMs Understanding of Turkish Indexical Pronouns in Indexical Shift Contexts": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, question answering, and solving complex mathematical problems. However, their primary training on data-rich languages like English limits their performance in low-resource languages. This study addresses this gap by focusing on the Indexical Shift problem in Turkish. The Indexical Shift problem involves resolving pronouns in indexical shift contexts, a grammatical challenge not present in high-resource languages like English. We present the first study examining indexical shift in any language, releasing a Turkish dataset specifically designed for this purpose. Our Indexical Shift Dataset consists of 156 multiple-choice questions, each annotated with necessary linguistic details, to evaluate LLMs in a few-shot setting. We evaluate recent multilingual LLMs, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Cohere-AYA, Trendyol-LLM, and Turkcell-LLM, using this dataset. Our analysis reveals that even advanced models like GPT-4 struggle with the grammatical nuances of indexical shift in Turkish, achieving only moderate performance. These findings underscore the need for focused research on the grammatical challenges posed by low-resource languages.",
    "Do LLMs Speak Kazakh? A Pilot Evaluation of Seven Models": "We conducted a systematic evaluation of seven large language models (LLMs) on tasks in Kazakh, a Turkic language spoken by approximately 13 million native speakers in Kazakhstan and abroad. We used six datasets corresponding to different tasks - questions answering, causal reasoning, middle school math problems, machine translation, and spelling correction. Three of the datasets were prepared for this study. As expected, the quality of the LLMs on the Kazakh tasks is lower than on the parallel English tasks. GPT-4 shows the best results, followed by Gemini and AYA. In general, LLMs perform better on classification tasks and struggle with generative tasks. Our results provide valuable insights into the applicability of currently available LLMs for Kazakh. We made the data collected for this study publicly available: https://github.com/akylbekmaxutov/LLM-eval-using-Kazakh.",
    "Do LVLMs Understand Charts? Analyzing and Correcting Factual Errors in Chart Captioning": "Advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have led to significant progress in generating natural language descriptions for visual contents. These powerful models are known for producing texts that are factually inconsistent with the visual input. While some efforts mitigate such inconsistencies in natural image captioning, the factuality of generated captions for structured visuals, such as charts, has not received as much scrutiny. This work introduces a comprehensive typology of factual errors in generated chart captions. A large-scale human annotation effort provides insight into the error patterns in captions generated by various models, ultimately forming the foundation of a dataset, CHOCOLATE. Our analysis reveals that even advanced models like GPT-4V frequently produce captions laced with factual inaccuracies. To combat this, we establish the task of Chart Caption Factual Error Correction and introduce CHARTVE, a visual entailment model that outperforms current LVLMs in evaluating caption factuality. Furthermore, we propose C2TFEC, an interpretable two-stage framework that excels at correcting factual errors. This work inaugurates a new domain in factual error correction for chart captions, presenting a novel evaluation metric, and demonstrating an effective approach to ensuring the factuality of generated chart captions. The code and data as well as continuously updated benchmark can be found at: https://khuangaf.github.io/CHOCOLATE/.",
    "Do Multilingual Large Language Models Mitigate Stereotype Bias?": "While preliminary findings indicate that multilingual LLMs exhibit reduced bias compared to monolingual ones, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of multilingual training on bias mitigation is lacking. This study addresses this gap by systematically training six LLMs of identical size (2.6B parameters) and architecture: five monolingual models (English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish) and one multilingual model trained on an equal distribution of data across these languages, all using publicly available data. To ensure robust evaluation, standard bias benchmarks were automatically translated into the five target languages and verified for both translation quality and bias preservation by human annotators. Our results consistently demonstrate that multilingual training effectively mitigates bias. Moreover, we observe that multilingual models achieve not only lower bias but also superior prediction accuracy when compared to monolingual models with the same amount of training data, model architecture, and size.",
    "Do PLMs and Annotators Share the Same Gender Bias? Definition, Dataset, and Framework of Contextualized Gender Bias": " Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved success in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, PLMs also introduce some disquieting safety problems, such as gender bias. Gender bias is an extremely complex issue, because different individuals may hold disparate opinions on whether the same sentence expresses harmful bias, especially those seemingly neutral or positive. This paper first defines the concept of contextualized gender bias (CGB), which makes it easy to measure implicit gender bias in both PLMs and annotators. We then construct CGBDataset, which contains 20k natural sentences with gendered words, from Chinese news. Similar to the task of masked language models, gendered words are masked for PLMs and annotators to judge whether a male word or a female word is more suitable. Then, we introduce CGBFrame to measure the gender bias of annotators. By comparing the results measured by PLMs and annotators, we find that though there are differences on the choices made by PLMs and annotators, they show significant consistency in general.",
    "Do Pre-Trained Language Models Detect and Understand Semantic Underspecification? Ask the DUST!": "In everyday language use, speakers frequently utter and interpret sentences that are semantically underspecified, namely, whose content is insufficient to fully convey their message or interpret them univocally. For example, to interpret the underspecified sentence “Don't spend too much”, which leaves implicit what (not) to spend, additional linguistic context or outside knowledge is needed. In this work, we propose a novel Dataset of semantically Underspecified Sentences grouped by Type (DUST) and use it to study whether pre-trained language models (LMs) correctly identify and interpret underspecified sentences. We find that newer LMs are reasonably able to identify underspecified sentences when explicitly prompted. However, interpreting them correctly is much harder for any LMs. Our experiments show that when interpreting underspecified sentences, LMs exhibit little uncertainty, contrary to what theoretical accounts of underspecification would predict. Overall, our study reveals limitations in current models' processing of sentence semantics and highlights the importance of using naturalistic data and communicative scenarios when evaluating LMs' language capabilities.",
    "Do Zombies Understand? A Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Exploration of Machine Cognition": "Recent advances in LLMs have sparked a debate on whether they understand text. In this position paper, we argue that opponents in this debate hold different definitions for understanding, and particularly differ in their view on the role of consciousness. To substantiate this claim, we propose a thought experiment involving an open-source chatbot Z which excels on every possible benchmark, seemingly without subjective experience. We ask whether Z is capable of understanding, and show that different schools of thought within seminal AI research seem to answer this question differently, uncovering their terminological disagreement. Moving forward, we propose two distinct working definitions for understanding which explicitly acknowledge the question of consciousness, and draw connections with a rich literature in philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience.",
    "DocFinQA: A Long-Context Financial Reasoning Dataset": "For large language models (LLMs) to be effective in the financial domain - where each decision can have a significant impact - it is necessary to investigate realistic tasks and data. Financial professionals often interact with documents spanning hundreds of pages, but most financial research datasets only deal with short excerpts from these documents. To address this, we introduce a long-document financial QA task. We augment 7,437 questions from the existing FinQA dataset with full-document context, extending the average context length from under 700 words in FinQA to 123k words in DocFinQA. We conduct extensive experiments over retrieval-based QA pipelines and long-context language models. Based on our experiments, DocFinQA proves a significant challenge for even state-of-the-art systems. We also provide a case study on a subset of the longest documents in DocFinQA and find that models particularly struggle with these documents. Addressing these challenges may have a wide-reaching impact across applications where specificity and long-range contexts are critical, like gene sequences and legal document contract analysis. DocFinQA dataset is publicly accessible.",
    "DocLLM: A Layout-Aware Generative Language Model for Multimodal Document Understanding": "Enterprise documents such as forms, receipts, reports, and other such records, often carry rich semantics at the intersection of textual and spatial modalities. The visual cues offered by their complex layouts play a crucial role in comprehending these documents effectively. In this paper, we present DocLLM, a lightweight extension to traditional large language models (LLMs) for reasoning over visual documents, taking into account both textual semantics and spatial layout. Our model differs from existing multimodal LLMs by avoiding expensive image encoders and focuses exclusively on bounding box information to incorporate the spatial layout structure. Specifically, the cross-alignment between text and spatial modalities is captured by decomposing the attention mechanism in classical transformers to a set of disentangled matrices. Furthermore, we devise a pre-training objective that learns to infill text segments. This approach allows us to address irregular layouts and heterogeneous content frequently encountered in visual documents. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned using a large-scale instruction dataset, covering four core document intelligence tasks. We demonstrate that our solution outperforms SotA LLMs on 14 out of 16 datasets across all tasks, and generalizes well to 4 out of 5 previously unseen datasets.",
    "DOCMATH-EVAL: Evaluating Math Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs in Understanding Long and Specialized Documents": "Recent LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving exam-like math word problems. However, the degree to which these numerical reasoning skills are effective in real-world scenarios, particularly in expert domains, is still largely unexplored. This paper introduces DOCMATH-EVAL, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the numerical reasoning capabilities of LLMs in the context of understanding and analyzing specialized documents containing both text and tables. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 48 LLMs using Chain-of-Thought and Program-of-Thought prompting techniques, aiming to comprehensively assess the capabilities and limitations of existing LLMs in DOCMATH-EVAL. We found that even the current best-performing system (i.e., GPT-4o) still significantly lags behind human experts in solving complex numerical reasoning problems grounded in long contexts. We believe that DOCMATH-EVAL can serve as a valuable benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in solving challenging numerical reasoning problems within expert domains.",
    "DocPilot: Copilot for Automating PDF Edit Workflows in Documents": "Digital documents, such as PDFs, are vital in business workflows, enabling communication, documentation, and collaboration. Handling PDFs can involve navigating complex workflows and numerous tools (e.g., comprehension, annotation, editing), which can be tedious and time-consuming for users. We introduce DocPilot, an AI-assisted document workflow Copilot system capable of understanding user intent and executing tasks accordingly to help users streamline their workflows. DocPilot undertakes intelligent orchestration of various tools through LLM prompting in four steps: (1) Task plan generation, (2) Task plan verification and self-correction, (3) Multi-turn User Feedback, and (4) Task Plan Execution via Code Generation and Error log-based Code Self-Revision. Our goal is to enhance user efficiency and productivity by simplifying and automating their document workflows with task delegation to DocPilot.",
    "Document-level Clinical Entity and Relation Extraction via Knowledge Base-Guided Generation": "Generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models have shown promise in clinical entity and relation extraction tasks because of their precise extraction and contextual understanding capability. In this work, we further leverage the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) knowledge base to accurately identify medical concepts and improve clinical entity and relation extraction at the document level. Our framework selects UMLS concepts relevant to the text and combines them with prompts to guide language models in extracting entities. Our experiments demonstrate that this initial concept mapping and the inclusion of these mapped concepts in the prompts improves extraction results compared to few-shot extraction tasks on generic language models that do not leverage UMLS. Further, our results show that this approach is more effective than the standard Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, where retrieved data is compared with prompt embeddings to generate results. Overall, we find that integrating UMLS concepts with GPT models significantly improves entity and relation identification, outperforming the baseline and RAG models. By combining the precise concept mapping capability of knowledge-based approaches like UMLS with the contextual understanding capability of GPT, our method highlights the potential of these approaches in specialized domains like healthcare.",
    "DODO : Dynamic Contextual Compression for Decoder-only LMs": "Transformer-based language models (LMs) are inefficient in long contexts. We propose DODO, a solution for context compression. Instead of one vector per token in a standard transformer model, DODO represents text with a dynamic number of hidden states at each layer, reducing the cost of self-attention to a fraction of typical time and space. Moreover, off-the-shelf models such as LLAMA can be adapted to DODO by efficient parameter tuning methods such as LoRA. In use, DODO can act as either an autoregressive LM or a context compressor for downstream tasks. We demonstrate through experiments in language modeling, question answering, and summarization that DODO retains capabilities in these tasks, while drastically reducing the overhead during decoding. For example, in the autoencoding task, DODO shrinks context at a 20x compression ratio with a BLEU score of 98% for reconstruction, achieving nearly lossless encoding.",
    "Does Cross-Cultural Alignment Change the Commonsense Morality of Language Models?": "Alignment of the language model with human preferences is a common approach to making a language model useful to end users. However, most alignment work is done in English, and human preference datasets are dominated by English, reflecting only the preferences of English-speaking annotators. Nevertheless, it is common practice to use the English preference data, either directly or by translating it into the target language, when aligning a multilingual language model. The question is whether such an alignment strategy marginalizes the preference of non-English speaking users. To this end, we investigate the effect of aligning Japanese language models with (mostly) English resources. In particular, we focus on evaluating whether the commonsense morality of the resulting fine-tuned models is aligned with Japanese culture using the JCommonsenseMorality (JCM) and ETHICS datasets. The experimental results show that the fine-tuned model outperforms the SFT model. However, it does not demonstrate the same level of improvement as a model fine-tuned using the JCM, suggesting that while some aspects of commonsense morality are transferable, others may not be.",
    "Does DETECTGPT Fully Utilize Perturbation? Bridging Selective Perturbation to Fine-tuned Contrastive Learning Detector would be Better": "The burgeoning generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised growing concerns about abuse, demanding automatic machine-generated text detectors. DetectGPT (Mitchell et al., 2023), a zero-shot metric-based detector, first introduces perturbation and shows great performance improvement. However, in DetectGPT, the random perturbation strategy could introduce noise, and logit regression depends on the threshold, harming the generalizability and applicability of individual or small-batch inputs. Hence, we propose a novel fine-tuned detector, PECOLA, bridging metric-based and fine-tuned methods by contrastive learning on selective perturbation. Selective strategy retains important tokens during perturbation and weights for multi-pair contrastive learning. The experiments show that PECOLA outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 1.20% in accuracy on average on four public datasets. And we further analyze the effectiveness, robustness, and generalization of the method.",
    "Does the structure of textual content have an impact on language models for automatic summarization?": "Despite recent improvements, the processing of long sequences with Transformers models remains a subject in its own right, including automatic summary. In this work, we present experiments on the automatic summarization of scientific articles using BART models, considering textual information coming from distinct passages from long texts for summarization. We demonstrate that considering document structure improves the performance of state-of-the-art models and approaches the performance of LongFormer in English.",
    "DolphCoder: Echo-Locating Code Large Language Models with Diverse and Multi-Objective Instruction Tuning": "Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in code-related tasks. Several instruction tuning approaches have been proposed to boost the code generation performance of pre-trained Code LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a diverse instruction model (DolphCoder) with self-evaluating for code generation. It learns diverse instruction targets and combines a code evaluation objective to enhance its code generation ability. Our model achieves superior performance on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, demonstrating new insights for future code instruction tuning work. Our key findings are: (1) Augmenting more diverse responses with distinct reasoning paths increases the code capability of LLMs. (2) Improving one's ability to evaluate the correctness of code solutions also enhances their ability to create it. Our code is released at https://github.com/pris-nlp/DolphCoder.",
    "Don't Augment, Rewrite? Assessing Abusive Language Detection with Synthetic Data": "Research on abusive language detection and content moderation is crucial to combat online harm. However, current limitations set by regulatory bodies and social media platforms can make it difficult to share collected data. We address this challenge by exploring the possibility to replace existing datasets in English for abusive language detection with synthetic data obtained by rewriting original texts with an instruction-based generative model. We show that such data can be effectively used to train a classifier whose performance is in line, and sometimes better, than a classifier trained on original data. Training with synthetic data also seems to improve robustness in a cross-dataset setting. A manual inspection of the generated data confirms that rewriting makes it impossible to retrieve the original texts online.",
    "Don't forget private retrieval: distributed private similarity search for large language models": "While the flexible capabilities of large language models (LLMs) allow them to answer a range of queries based on existing learned knowledge, information retrieval to augment generation is an important tool to allow LLMs to answer questions on information not included in pre-training data. Such private information is increasingly being generated in a wide array of distributed contexts by organizations and individuals. Performing such information retrieval using neural embeddings of queries and documents always leaked information about queries and database content unless both were stored locally. We present Private Retrieval Augmented Generation (PRAG), an approach that uses multi-party computation (MPC) to securely transmit queries to a distributed set of servers containing a privately constructed database to return top-k and approximate top-k documents. This is a first-of-its-kind approach to dense information retrieval that ensures no server observes a client's query or can see the database content. The approach introduces a novel MPC friendly protocol for inverted file approximate search (IVF) that allows for fast document search over distributed and private data in sublinear communication complexity. This work presents new avenues through which data for use in LLMs can be accessed and used without needing to centralize or forgo privacy.",
    "Don't Go To Extremes: Revealing the Excessive Sensitivity and Calibration Limitations of LLMs in Implicit Hate Speech Detection": "The fairness and trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) are receiving increasing attention. Implicit hate speech, which employs indirect language to convey hateful intentions, occupies a significant portion of practice. However, the extent to which LLMs effectively address this issue remains insufficiently examined. This paper delves into the capability of LLMs to detect implicit hate speech (Classification Task) and express confidence in their responses (Calibration Task). Our evaluation meticulously considers various prompt patterns and mainstream uncertainty estimation methods. Our findings highlight that LLMs exhibit two extremes: (1) LLMs display excessive sensitivity towards groups or topics that may cause fairness issues, resulting in misclassifying benign statements as hate speech. (2) LLMs' confidence scores for each method excessively concentrate on a fixed range, remaining unchanged regardless of the dataset's complexity. Consequently, the calibration performance is heavily reliant on primary classification accuracy. These discoveries unveil new limitations of LLMs, underscoring the need for caution when optimizing models to ensure they do not veer towards extremes. This serves as a reminder to carefully consider sensitivity and confidence in the pursuit of model fairness.",
    "Don't Hallucinate, Abstain: Identifying LLM Knowledge Gaps via Multi-LLM Collaboration": "Despite efforts to expand the knowledge of large language models (LLMs), knowledge gaps—missing or outdated information in LLMs—might always persist given the evolving nature of knowledge. In this work, we study approaches to identify LLM knowledge gaps and abstain from answering questions when knowledge gaps are present. We first adapt existing approaches to model calibration or adaptation through fine-tuning/prompting and analyze their ability to abstain from generating low-confidence outputs. Motivated by their failures in self-reflection and over-reliance on held-out sets, we propose two novel approaches that are based on model collaboration, i.e., LLMs probing other LLMs for knowledge gaps, either cooperatively or competitively. Extensive experiments with three LLMs on four QA tasks featuring diverse knowledge domains demonstrate that both cooperative and competitive approaches to unveiling LLM knowledge gaps achieve up to 19.3% improvements on abstain accuracy against the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals that our abstention methods pinpoint failure cases in retrieval augmentation and knowledge gaps in multi-hop reasoning.",
    "Don't Rank, Combine! Combining Machine Translation Hypotheses Using Quality Estimation": "Neural machine translation systems estimate probabilities of target sentences given source sentences, yet these estimates may not align with human preferences. This work introduces QE-fusion, a method that synthesizes translations using a quality estimation metric (QE), which correlates better with human judgments. QE-fusion leverages a pool of candidates sampled from a model and combines spans from different candidates using a QE metric such as COMETKIWI. We compare QE-fusion against beam search and recent reranking techniques, such as Minimum Bayes Risk decoding or QE-reranking. Our method consistently improves translation quality in terms of COMET and BLEURT scores when applied to large language models (LLMs) used for translation (PolyLM, XGLM, Llama2, Mistral, ALMA, and Tower) and to multilingual translation models (NLLB), over five language pairs. Notably, QE-fusion exhibits larger improvements for LLMs due to their ability to generate diverse outputs. We demonstrate that our approach generates novel translations in over half of the cases and consistently outperforms other methods across varying numbers of candidates (5-200). Furthermore, we empirically show that QE-fusion scales linearly with the number of candidates in the pool.",
    "DORY: Deliberative Prompt Recovery for LLM": "Prompt recovery in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding how LLMs work and addressing concerns regarding privacy, copyright, etc. The trend towards inference-only APIs complicates this task by restricting access to essential outputs for recovery. To tackle this challenge, we extract prompt-related information from limited outputs and identify a strong(negative) correlation between output probability-based uncertainty and the success of prompt recovery. This finding led to the development of Deliberative PrOmpt RecoverY (DORY), our novel approach that leverages uncertainty to recover prompts accurately. DORY involves reconstructing drafts from outputs, refining these with hints, and filtering out noise based on uncertainty. Our evaluation across diverse LLMs and prompt benchmarks shows that DORY outperforms existing baselines, improving performance by approximately 10.82% and establishing a new state-of-the-art record in prompt recovery tasks. Significantly, DORY operates using a single LLM without any external resources or model, offering a cost-effective, user-friendly prompt recovery solution.",
    "DP-MLM: Differentially Private Text Rewriting Using Masked Language Models": "The task of text privatization using Differential Privacy has recently taken the form of text rewriting, in which an input text is obfuscated via the use of generative (large) language models. While these methods have shown promising results in the ability to preserve privacy, these methods rely on autoregressive models which lack a mechanism to contextualize the private rewriting process. In response to this, we propose DP-MLM, a new method for differentially private text rewriting based on leveraging masked language models (MLMs) to rewrite text in a semantically similar and obfuscated manner. We accomplish this with a simple contextualization technique, whereby we rewrite a text one token at a time. We find that utilizing encoder-only MLMs provides better utility preservation at lower ε levels, as compared to previous methods relying on larger models with a decoder. In addition, MLMs allow for greater customization of the rewriting mechanism, as opposed to generative approaches. We make the code for DP-MLM public and reusable, found at https://github.com/sjmeis/DPMLM.",
    "DPDLLM: A Black-box Framework for Detecting Pre-training Data from Large Language Models": "The success of large language models (LLM) benefits from large-scale model parameters and large amounts of pre-training data. However, the textual data for training LLM can not be confirmed to be legal because they are crawled from different web sites. For example, there are copyrighted articles, personal reviews and information in the pre-training data for LLM which are illegal. To address the above issue and develop legal LLM, we propose to detect the pre-training data from LLM in a pure black-box way because the existing LLM services only return the generated text. The previous most related works are the membership inference attack (MIA) on machine learning models to detect the training data from them. But the existing methods are based on analyzing the output probabilities of models which are unrealistic to LLM services. To tackle the problem, we firstly construct the benchmark datasets by collecting textual data from different domains as the seen and unseen pre-training data for LLMs. Then, we investigate a black-box framework named DPDLLM, with the only access to the generated texts from LLM for detecting textual data whether was used to train it. In the proposed framework, we exploit GPT-2 as the reference model to fit the textual data and feed the generated text from LLM into it to acquire sequence probabilities as the significant feature for detection. The experimental results on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that DPDLLM is effective on different popular LLMs and outperforms the existing methods.",
    "Dr.Academy: A Benchmark for Evaluating Questioning Capability in Education for Large Language Models": "Teachers are important to imparting knowledge and guiding learners, and the role of large language models (LLMs) as potential educators is emerging as an important area of study. Recognizing LLMs' capability to generate educational content can lead to advances in automated and personalized learning. While LLMs have been tested for their comprehension and problem-solving skills, their capability in teaching remains largely unexplored. In teaching, questioning is a key skill that guides students to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize core concepts and principles. Therefore, our research introduces a benchmark to evaluate the questioning capability in education as a teacher of LLMs through evaluating their generated educational questions, utilizing Anderson and Krathwohl's taxonomy across general, monodisciplinary, and interdisciplinary domains. We shift the focus from LLMs as learners to LLMs as educators, assessing their teaching capability through guiding them to generate questions. We apply four metrics, including relevance, coverage, representativeness, and consistency, to evaluate the educational quality of LLMs' outputs. Our results indicate that GPT-4 demonstrates significant potential in teaching general, humanities, and science courses; Claude2 appears more apt as an interdisciplinary teacher. Furthermore, the automatic scores align with human perspectives.",
    "Draft & Verify: Lossless Large Language Model Acceleration via Self-Speculative Decoding": "We present a novel inference scheme, self-speculative decoding, for accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for an auxiliary model. This approach is characterized by a two-stage process: drafting and verification. The drafting stage generates draft tokens at a slightly lower quality but more quickly, which is achieved by selectively skipping certain intermediate layers during drafting. Subsequently, the verification stage employs the original LLM to validate those draft output tokens in one forward pass. This process ensures the final output remains identical to that produced by the unaltered LLM. Moreover, the proposed method requires no additional neural network training and no extra memory footprint, making it a plug-and-play and cost-effective solution for inference acceleration. Benchmarks with LLaMA-2 and its variants demonstrated a speedup up to 1.99×.",
    "DRAGIN: Dynamic Retrieval Augmented Generation based on the Information Needs of Large Language Models": "Dynamic retrieval augmented generation (RAG) paradigm actively decides when and what to retrieve during the text generation process of Large Language Models (LLMs). There are two key elements of this paradigm: identifying the optimal moment to activate the retrieval module (deciding when to retrieve) and crafting the appropriate query once retrieval is triggered (determining what to retrieve). However, current dynamic RAG methods fall short in both aspects. Firstly, the strategies for deciding when to retrieve often rely on static rules. Moreover, the strategies for deciding what to retrieve typically limit themselves to the LLM's most recent sentence or the last few tokens, while the LLM's information needs may span across the entire context. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new framework, DRAGIN, i.e., Dynamic Retrieval Augmented Generation based on the Information Needs of LLMs. Our framework is specifically designed to make decisions on when and what to retrieve based on the LLM's information needs during the text generation process. We evaluate DRAGIN along with existing methods comprehensively over 4 knowledge-intensive generation datasets. Experimental results show that DRAGIN achieves superior performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.",
    "DRU at WojoodNER 2024: A Multi-level Method Approach": "In this paper, we present our submission for the WojoodNER 2024 Shared Tasks addressing flat and nested sub-tasks (1, 2). We experiment with three different approaches. We train (i) an Arabic fine-tuned version of BLOOMZ-7b-mt, GEMMA-7b, and AraBERTv2 on multi-label token classifications task; (ii) two AraBERTv2 models, on main types and sub-types respectively; and (iii) one model for main types and four for the four sub-types. Based on the Wojood NER 2024 test set results, the three fine-tuned models performed similarly with AraBERTv2 favored (F1: Flat=.8780 Nested=.9040). The five model approach performed slightly better (F1: Flat=.8782 Nested=.9043).",
    "DRU at WojoodNER 2024: ICL LLM for Arabic NER": "This paper details our submission to the WojoodNER Shared Task 2024, leveraging in-context learning with large language models for Arabic Named Entity Recognition. We utilized the Command R model, to perform fine-grained NER on the Wojood-Fine corpus. Our primary approach achieved an F1 score of 0.737 and a recall of 0.756. Post-processing the generated predictions to correct format inconsistencies resulted in an increased recall of 0.759, and a similar F1 score of 0.735. A multi-level prompting method and aggregation of outputs resulted in a lower F1 score of 0.637. Our results demonstrate the potential of ICL for Arabic NER while highlighting challenges related to LLM output consistency.",
    "DS-Group at SIGHAN-2024 dimABSA Task: Constructing In-context Learning Structure for Dimensional Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis": "Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is an important subtask in Natural Language Processing (NLP). More recent research within ABSA have consistently focused on conducting more precise sentiment analysis on aspects, i.e., dimensional Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (dimABSA). However, previous approaches have not systematically explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in dimABSA. To fill the gap, we propose a novel In-Context Learning (ICL) structure with a novel aspect-aware ICL example selection method, to enhance the performance of LLMs in dimABSA. Experiments show that our proposed ICL structure significantly improves the fine-grained sentiment analysis abilities of LLMs. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Maydayflower/dimABSA-ICL.",
    "DSLR: Document Refinement with Sentence-Level Re-ranking and Reconstruction to Enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved their performance across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with generating non-factual responses due to limitations in their parametric memory. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address this issue by incorporating external knowledge with a retrieval module. Despite their successes, however, current RAG systems face challenges with retrieval failures and the limited ability of LLMs to filter out irrelevant information. Therefore, in this work, we propose DSLR (Document Refinement with Sentence-Level Re-ranking and Reconstruction), an unsupervised framework that decomposes retrieved documents into sentences, filters out irrelevant sentences, and reconstructs them again into coherent passages. We experimentally validate DSLR on multiple open-domain QA datasets and the results demonstrate that DSLR significantly enhances the RAG performance over conventional fixed-size passage. Furthermore, our DSLR enhances performance in specific, yet realistic scenarios without the need for additional training, providing an effective and efficient solution for refining retrieved documents in RAG systems.",
    "DUAL-REFLECT: Enhancing Large Language Models for Reflective Translation through Dual Learning Feedback Mechanisms": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) enhanced by self-reflection have achieved promising performance on machine translation. The key idea is guiding LLMs to generate translation with human-like feedback. However, existing self-reflection methods lack effective feedback information, limiting the translation performance. To address this, we introduce a DUAL-REFLECT framework, leveraging the dual learning of translation tasks to provide effective feedback, thereby enhancing the models' self-reflective abilities and improving translation performance. The application of this method across various translation tasks has proven its effectiveness in improving translation accuracy and eliminating ambiguities, especially in translation tasks with low-resource language pairs.",
    "Dual-Stage Multi-Task Syntax-Oriented Pre-Training for Syntactically Controlled Paraphrase Generation": "Syntactically Controlled Paraphrase Generation (SCPG), which aims at generating sentences having syntactic structures resembling given exemplars, is attracting more research efforts in recent years. We took an empirical survey on previous SCPG datasets and methods and found three tacitly approved while seldom mentioned intrinsic shortcomings/trade-offs in terms of data obtaining, task formulation, and pre-training strategies. As a mitigation to these shortcomings, we proposed a novel Dual-Stage Multi-Task (DSMT) pre-training scheme, involving a series of structure-oriented and syntax-oriented tasks, which, in our opinion, gives sequential text models the ability of comprehending intrinsically non-sequential structures like Linearized Constituency Trees (LCTs), understanding the underlying syntactics, and even generating them by parsing sentences. We performed further pre-training of the popular T5 model on these novel tasks and fine-tuned the trained model on every possible variant of SCPG task in literature, finding that our models significantly outperformed (up to 10+ BLEU-4) previous state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we carried out ablation studies which demonstrated the effectiveness of our DSMT methods and emphasized on the SCPG performance gains compared to vanilla T5 models, especially on hard samples or under few-shot settings.",
    "Duwak: Dual Watermarks in Large Language Models": "As large language models (LLM) are increasingly used for text generation tasks, it is critical to audit their usages, govern their applications, and mitigate their potential harms. Existing watermark techniques are shown effective in embedding single human-imperceptible and machine-detectable patterns without significantly affecting generated text quality and semantics. However, the efficiency in detecting watermarks, i.e., the minimum number of tokens required to assert detection with significance and robustness against post-editing, is still debatable. In this paper, we propose, Duwak, to fundamentally enhance the efficiency and quality of watermarking by embedding dual secret patterns in both token probability distribution and sampling schemes. To mitigate expression degradation caused by biasing toward specific tokens, we design a contrastive search to watermark the sampling scheme, which minimizes the token repetition and enhances the diversity. We theoretically explain the interdependency of the two watermarks within Duwak. We evaluate Duwak extensively on Llama2 and Vicuna under various post-editing attacks, against four state-of-the-art watermarking techniques and combinations of them. Our results show that Duwak marked text achieves the highest watermarked text quality at the lowest required token count for detection, up to 70% tokens less than existing approaches, especially under post paraphrasing.",
    "Dwell in the Beginning: How Language Models Embed Long Documents for Dense Retrieval": "This study investigates the existence of positional biases in Transformer-based language models for text representation learning, particularly in the context of web document retrieval. We build on previous research that demonstrated loss of information in the middle of input sequences for causal language models, extending it to the domain of embedding learning. We examine positional biases at multiple stages of the training pipeline for an encoder-decoder neural retrieval model, namely language model pre-training, contrastive pre-training, and contrastive fine-tuning. Experiments with the MS-MARCO document collection reveal that after contrastive pre-training the model already generates embeddings that better capture the beginning of the input content, with fine-tuning further aggravating this effect.",
    "E-EVAL: A Comprehensive Chinese K-12 Education Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models": "The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their increasing utilization in Chinese K-12 education. Despite the growing integration of LLMs and education, the absence of a dedicated benchmark for evaluating LLMs within this domain presents a pressing concern. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive natural language processing benchmark to precisely assess the capabilities of various LLMs in Chinese K-12 education. In response, we introduce E-EVAL, the first comprehensive evaluation benchmark specifically tailored for Chinese K-12 education. E-EVAL comprises 4,351 multiple-choice questions spanning primary, middle, and high school levels, covering a diverse array of subjects. Through meticulous evaluation, we find that Chinese-dominant models often outperform English-dominant ones, with many exceeding GPT 4.0. However, most struggle with complex subjects like mathematics. Additionally, our analysis indicates that most Chinese-dominant LLMs do not achieve higher scores at the primary school level compared to the middle school level, highlighting the nuanced relationship between proficiency in higher-order and lower-order knowledge domains. Furthermore, experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the Chain of Thought (CoT) technique in scientific subjects and Few-shot prompting in liberal arts. Through E-EVAL, we aim to conduct a rigorous analysis delineating the strengths and limitations of LLMs in educational applications, thereby contributing significantly to the advancement of Chinese K-12 education and LLMs.",
    "e-Health CSIRO at “Discharge Me!” 2024: Generating Discharge Summary Sections with Fine-tuned Language Models": "Clinical documentation is an important aspect of clinicians' daily work and often demands a significant amount of time. The BioNLP 2024 Shared Task on Streamlining Discharge Documentation (Discharge Me!) aims to alleviate this documentation burden by automatically generating discharge summary sections, including brief hospital course and discharge instruction, which are often time-consuming to synthesize and write manually. We approach the generation task by fine-tuning multiple open-sourced language models (LMs), including both decoder-only and encoder-decoder LMs, with various configurations on input context. We also examine different setups for decoding algorithms, model ensembling or merging, and model specialization. Our results show that conditioning on the content of discharge summary prior to the target sections is effective for the generation task. Furthermore, we find that smaller encoder-decoder LMs can work as well or even slightly better than larger decoder-based LMs fine-tuned through LoRA. The model checkpoints from our team (aehrc) are openly available.",
    "E2-LLM: Efficient and Extreme Length Extension of Large Language Models": "Training Large Language Models (LLMs) to process extensive context lengths incurs prohibitive computational costs. Prevailing techniques for extending context capabilities in LLMs typically require not only additional training procedures but also access to datasets with long context (e.g., sequences of 32K tokens), presupposing substantial GPU expenditures. To address the aforementioned issues, we introduce a novel solution named Efficient and Extreme length extension for Large Language Models (E2-LLM). E2-LLM entails a singular training process over considerably short sequences (e.g., 4K tokens), which greatly mitigates the cost of continual-pretraining or fine-tuning. Within the training phase, we incorporate a dual augmentation strategy with Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) that adjusts the scale and position indices across distinct training samples. E2-LLM is meticulously designed to enhance the model's robustness to diverse relative positions. The experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of E2-LLM on demanding tasks of processing long contexts.",
    "EasyEdit: An Easy-to-use Knowledge Editing Framework for Large Language Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) usually suffer from knowledge cutoff or fallacy issues, which means they are unaware of unseen events or generate text with incorrect facts owing to outdated/noisy data. To this end, many knowledge editing approaches for LLMs have emerged - aiming to subtly inject/edit updated knowledge or adjust undesired behavior while minimizing the impact on unrelated inputs. Nevertheless, due to significant differences among various knowledge editing methods and the variations in task setups, there is no standard implementation framework available for the community, which hinders practitioners from applying knowledge editing to applications. To address these issues, we propose EASYEDIT, an easy-to-use knowledge editing framework for LLMs. It supports various cutting-edge knowledge editing approaches and can be readily applied to many well-known LLMs such as T5, GPT-J, LlaMA, etc. Empirically, we report the knowledge editing results on LlaMA-2 with EASYEDIT, demonstrating that knowledge editing surpasses traditional fine-tuning in terms of reliability and generalization. We have released the source code on GitHub1, along with Google Colab tutorials and comprehensive documentation2 for beginners to get started. Besides, we present an online system3 for real-time knowledge editing, and a demo video4.",

Unlike existing multimodal models that predominately depend on encoders like CLIP or ImageBind and need ample amounts of training data to bridge modalities, EasyGen leverages BiDiffuser, a bidirectional conditional diffusion model, to foster more efficient modality interactions. EasyGen achieves text generation by training a projection layer linking BiDiffuser and an LLM, and facilities image generation by training an adapter to align the LLM's text space with the BiDiffuser's image space. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that EasyGen excels in data-efficient training, high-quality image generation, and extendibility, effectively addressing the challenges in multimodal generation.",
    "ECoK: Emotional Commonsense Knowledge Graph for Mining Emotional Gold": "The demand for understanding and expressing emotions in the field of natural language processing is growing rapidly. Knowledge graphs, as an important form of knowledge representation, have been widely utilized in various emotion-related tasks. However, existing knowledge graphs mainly focus on the representation and reasoning of general factual knowledge, while there are still significant deficiencies in the understanding and reasoning of emotional knowledge. In this work, we construct a comprehensive and accurate emotional commonsense knowledge graph, ECoK. We integrate cutting-edge theories from multiple disciplines such as psychology, cognitive science, and linguistics, and combine techniques such as large language models and natural language processing. By mining a large amount of text, dialogue, and sentiment analysis data, we construct rich emotional knowledge and establish the knowledge generation model COMET-ECoK. Experimental results show that ECoK contains high-quality emotional reasoning triples, and the performance of our knowledge generation model surpasses GPT-4-Turbo, which can help downstream tasks better understand and reason about emotions. Our data and code is available from https://github.com/ZornWang/ECoK.",
    "EconAgent: Large Language Model-Empowered Agents for Simulating Macroeconomic Activities": "The advent of artificial intelligence has led to a growing emphasis on data-driven modeling in macroeconomics, with agent-based modeling (ABM) emerging as a prominent bottom-up simulation paradigm. In ABM, agents (e.g., households, firms) interact within a macroeconomic environment, collectively generating market dynamics. Existing agent modeling typically employs predetermined rules or learning-based neural networks for decision-making. However, customizing each agent presents significant challenges, complicating the modeling of agent heterogeneity. Additionally, the influence of multi-period market dynamics and multifaceted macroeconomic factors are often overlooked in decision-making processes. In this work, we introduce EconAgent, a large language model-empowered agent with human-like characteristics for macroeconomic simulation. We first construct a simulation environment that incorporates various market dynamics driven by agents' decisions regarding work and consumption. Through the perception module, we create heterogeneous agents with distinct decision-making mechanisms. Furthermore, we model the impact of macroeconomic trends using a memory module, which allows agents to reflect on past individual experiences and market dynamics. Simulation experiments show that EconAgent can make realistic decisions, leading to more reasonable macroeconomic phenomena compared to existing rule-based or learning-based agents. Our codes are released at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/ACL24-EconAgent.",
    "EconNLI: Evaluating Large Language Models on Economics Reasoning": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for writing economic analysis reports or providing financial advice, but their ability to understand economic knowledge and reason about potential results of specific economic events lacks systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we propose a new dataset, natural language inference on economic events (EconNLI), to evaluate LLMs' knowledge and reasoning abilities in the economic domain. We evaluate LLMs on (1) their ability to correctly classify whether a premise event will cause a hypothesis event and (2) their ability to generate reasonable events resulting from a given premise. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are not sophisticated in economic reasoning and may generate wrong or hallucinated answers. Our study raises awareness of the limitations of using LLMs for critical decision-making involving economic reasoning and analysis.",
    "EcoRank: Budget-Constrained Text Re-ranking Using Large Language Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in text re-ranking. This process includes queries and candidate passages in the prompts, utilizing pointwise, listwise, and pairwise prompting strategies. A limitation of these ranking strategies with LLMs is their cost: the process can become expensive due to API charges, which are based on the number of input and output tokens. We study how to maximize the re-ranking performance given a budget, by navigating the vast search spaces of prompt choices, LLM APIs, and budget splits. We propose a suite of budget-constrained methods to perform text re-ranking using a set of LLM APIs. Our most efficient method, called EcoRank, is a two-layered pipeline that jointly optimizes decisions regarding budget allocation across prompt strategies and LLM APIs. Our experimental results on four popular QA and passage re-ranking datasets show that EcoRank outperforms other budget-aware supervised and unsupervised baselines.",

However, the mechanism and selection strategy for in-context example selection, which is a crucial ingredient in this approach, lacks systematic and in-depth research. In this paper, we propose a data compression approach to the selection of in-context examples. We introduce a two-stage method that can effectively choose relevant examples and retain sufficient information about the training dataset within the in-context examples. Our method shows a significant improvement of an average of 5.90% across five different real-world datasets using four language models.",
    "Effects of diversity incentives on sample diversity and downstream model performance in LLM-based text augmentation": "The latest generative large language models (LLMs) have found their application in data augmentation tasks, where small numbers of text samples are LLM-paraphrased and then used to fine-tune downstream models. However, more research is needed to assess how different prompts, seed data selection strategies, filtering methods, or model settings affect the quality of paraphrased data (and downstream models). In this study, we investigate three text diversity incentive methods well established in crowdsourcing: taboo words, hints by previous outlier solutions, and chaining on previous outlier solutions. Using these incentive methods as part of instructions to LLMs augmenting text datasets, we measure their effects on generated texts' lexical diversity and downstream model performance. We compare the effects over 5 different LLMs, 6 datasets and 2 downstream models. We show that diversity is most increased by taboo words, but downstream model performance is highest with hints.",
    "Efficient Continual Pre-training for Building Domain Specific Large Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable open-domain capabilities. LLMs tailored for a domain are typically trained entirely on domain corpus to excel at handling domain-specific tasks. In this work, we explore an alternative strategy of continual pre-training as a means to develop domain-specific LLMs over an existing open-domain LLM. We introduce FinPythia-6.9B, developed through domain-adaptive continual pre-training on the financial domain. Continual pre-trained FinPythia showcases consistent improvements on financial tasks over the original foundational model. We further explore simple but effective data selection strategies for continual pre-training. Our data selection strategies outperform vanilla continual pre-training's performance with just 10% of corpus size and cost, without any degradation on open-domain standard tasks. Our work proposes an alternative solution to building domain-specific LLMs cost-effectively.",
    "Efficient Detection of LLM-generated Texts with a Bayesian Surrogate Model": "The detection of machine-generated text, especially from large language models (LLMs), is crucial in preventing serious social problems resulting from their misuse. Some methods train dedicated detectors on specific datasets but fall short in generalizing to unseen test data, while other zero-shot ones often yield suboptimal performance. Although the recent DetectGPT has shown promising detection performance, it suffers from significant inefficiency issues, as detecting a single candidate requires querying the source LLM with hundreds of its perturbations. This paper aims to bridge this gap. Concretely, we propose to incorporate a Bayesian surrogate model, which allows us to select typical samples based on Bayesian uncertainty and interpolate scores from typical samples to other samples, to improve query efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches under a low query budget. Notably, when detecting the text generated by LLaMA family models, our method with just 2 or 3 queries can outperform DetectGPT with 200 queries.",
    "Efficient Knowledge Infusion via KG-LLM Alignment": "To tackle the problem of domain-specific knowledge scarcity within large language models (LLMs), knowledge graph-retrieval-augmented method has been proven to be an effective and efficient technique for knowledge infusion. However, existing approaches face two primary challenges: knowledge mismatch between public available knowledge graphs and the specific domain of the task at hand, and poor information compliance of LLMs with knowledge graphs. In this paper, we leverage a small set of labeled samples and a large-scale corpus to efficiently construct domain-specific knowledge graphs by an LLM, addressing the issue of knowledge mismatch. Additionally, we propose a three-stage KG-LLM alignment strategy to enhance the LLM's capability to utilize information from knowledge graphs. We conduct experiments with a limited-sample setting on two biomedical question-answering datasets, and the results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines.",
    "Efficient Sparse Attention needs Adaptive Token Release": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide array of text-centric tasks. However, their 'large' scale introduces significant computational and storage challenges, particularly in managing the key-value states of the transformer, which limits their wider applicability. Therefore, we propose to adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states. Particularly, we accomplish this by a lightweight controller module to approximate an ideal top-K sparse attention. This module retains the tokens with the highest top-K attention weights and simultaneously rebuilds the discarded but necessary tokens, which may become essential for future decoding. Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and modeling reveal that our method is not only competitive with full attention in terms of performance but also achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to 221.8%. The code for replication is available on the https://github.com/WHUIR/ADORE.",
    "Efficient Training of Language Models with Compact and Consistent Next Token Distributions": "Maximizing the likelihood of the next token is an established, statistically sound objective for pre-training language models. In this paper we show that we can train better models faster by pre-aggregating the corpus with a collapsed n-gram distribution. Previous studies have proposed corpus-level n-gram statistics as a regularizer; however, the construction and querying of such n-grams, if done naively, prove to be costly and significantly impede training speed, thereby limiting their application in modern large language model pre-training. We introduce an alternative compact representation of the next token distribution that, in expectation, aligns with the complete n-gram distribution while markedly reducing variance across mini-batches compared to the standard next-token loss. Empirically, we demonstrate that both the n-gram regularized model and our approximation yield substantial improvements in model quality and convergence rate compared to existing methods. Furthermore, our approximation facilitates scalability of gains to larger datasets and models compared to the straightforward n-gram regularization method.",
    "Efficiently Exploring Large Language Models for Document-Level Machine Translation with In-context Learning": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit outstanding performance in machine translation via in-context learning. In contrast to sentence-level translation, document-level translation (DOCMT) by LLMs based on in-context learning faces two major challenges: (1) document translations generated by LLMs are often incoherent; (2) the length of demonstration for in-context learning is usually limited. To address these issues, we propose a Context-Aware Prompting method (CAP), which enables LLMs to generate more accurate, cohesive, and coherent translations via in-context learning. CAP takes into account multi-level attention, selects the most relevant sentences to the current one as context, and then generates a summary from these collected sentences. Subsequently, sentences most similar to the summary are retrieved from the datastore as demonstrations, which effectively guide LLMs in generating cohesive and coherent translations. We conduct extensive experiments across various DOCMT tasks, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in zero pronoun translation (ZPT) and literary translation tasks.",
    "EFSA: Towards Event-Level Financial Sentiment Analysis": "In this paper, we extend financial sentiment analysis (FSA) to event-level since events usually serve as the subject of the sentiment in financial text. Though extracting events from the financial text may be conducive to accurate sentiment predictions, it has specialized challenges due to the lengthy and discontinuity of events in a financial text. To this end, we reconceptualize the event extraction as a classification task by designing a categorization comprising coarse-grained and fine-grained event categories. Under this setting, we formulate the Event-Level Financial Sentiment Analysis (EFSA for short) task that outputs quintuples consisting of (company, industry, coarse-grained event, fine-grained event, sentiment) from financial text. A large-scale Chinese dataset containing 12,160 news articles and 13,725 quintuples is publicized as a brand new testbed for our task. A four-hop Chain-of-Thought LLM-based approach is devised for this task. Systematically investigations are conducted on our dataset, and the empirical results demonstrate the benchmarking scores of existing methods and our proposed method can reach the current state-of-the-art. Our dataset and framework implementation are available at https://github.com/cty1934/EFSA.",
    "ELAD: Explanation-Guided Large Language Models Active Distillation": "The deployment and application of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by their memory inefficiency, computational demands, and the high costs of API inferences. Traditional distillation methods, which transfer the capabilities of LLMs to smaller models, often fail to determine whether the knowledge has been sufficiently transferred, potentially resulting in high costs or incomplete distillation. In this paper, we propose an Explanation-Guided LLMs Active Distillation (ELAD) framework that employs an active learning strategy to optimize the balance between annotation costs and model performance. To improve the efficiency of sample selection, we introduce an explanation-guided sample selection method that identifies samples challenging its reasoning by exploiting uncertainties in reasoning explanation steps. Additionally, we present a customized LLM-annotated explanation revision technique where the teacher model detects and corrects flaws in the student model's reasoning. Our experiments across various reasoning datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the efficiency of LLMs knowledge distillation.",
    "Eliciting Better Multilingual Structured Reasoning from LLMs through Code": "The development of large language models (LLM) has shown progress on reasoning, though studies have largely considered either English or simple reasoning tasks. To address this, we introduce a multilingual structured reasoning and explanation dataset, termed xSTREET, that covers four tasks across six languages. xSTREET exposes a gap in base LLM performance between English and non-English reasoning tasks. We then propose two methods to remedy this gap, building on the insight that LLMs trained on code are better reasoners. First, at training time, we augment a code dataset with multilingual comments using machine translation while keeping program code as-is. Second, at inference time, we bridge the gap between training and inference by employing a prompt structure that incorporates step-by-step code primitives to derive new facts and find a solution. Our methods show improved multilingual performance on xSTREET, most notably on the scientific commonsense reasoning subtask. Furthermore, the models show no regression on non-reasoning tasks, thus demonstrating our techniques maintain general-purpose abilities.",
    "Eliciting Non-English Alignment in Foundation Language Model": "While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been a straightforward approach for tailoring the output of foundation large language model (LLM) to specific preferences, concerns have been raised about the depth of this alignment, with some critiques suggesting it is merely “superficial”. We critically examine this hypothesis within the scope of cross-lingual generation tasks, proposing that the effectiveness of SFT may be constrained by its reliance on prior tokens to guide cross-lingual generation. Based on this crucial insight, and in response to the challenges posed by the costly and limited availability of non-English data for SFT, we introduce a novel training-free alignment method named PRETTY, which employs minimal task-related prior tokens to bridge the foundation LLM and the SFT LLM, achieving comparable performance without training. Experiments on machine translation and part-of-speech tagging across eight languages demonstrate the efficacy of PRETTY in cross-lingual settings. Remarkably, by initiating the decoding process with only one or two prior tokens, foundation LLMs can achieve performance comparable to their SFT counterparts. This method presents a cost-effective alternative to SFT and advances the democratization of multilingual LLMs.",
    "ELLA: Empowering LLMs for Interpretable, Accurate and Informative Legal Advice": "Despite remarkable performance in legal consultation exhibited by legal Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with legal article retrieval components, there are still cases when the advice given is incorrect or baseless. To alleviate these problems, we propose ELLA, a tool for Empowering LLMs for interpretable, accurate, and informative Legal Advice. ELLA visually presents the correlation between legal articles and LLM's response by calculating their similarities, providing users with an intuitive legal basis for the responses. Besides, based on the users' queries, ELLA retrieves relevant legal articles and displays them to users. Users can interactively select legal articles for LLM to generate more accurate responses. ELLA also retrieves relevant legal cases for user reference. Our user study shows that presenting the legal basis for the response helps users understand better. The accuracy of LLM's responses also improves when users intervene in selecting legal articles for LLM. Providing relevant legal cases also aids individuals in obtaining comprehensive information.",
    "EmbSpatial-Bench: Benchmarking Spatial Understanding for Embodied Tasks with Large Vision-Language Models": "The recent rapid development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has indicated their potential for embodied tasks. However, the critical skill of spatial understanding in embodied environments has not been thoroughly evaluated, leaving the gap between current LVLMs and qualified embodied intelligence unknown. Therefore, we construct EmbSpatial-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating embodied spatial understanding of LVLMs. The benchmark is automatically derived from embodied scenes and covers 6 spatial relationships from an egocentric perspective. Experiments expose the insufficient capacity of current LVLMs (even GPT-4V). We further present EmbSpatial-SFT, an instruction-tuning dataset designed to improve LVLMs' embodied spatial understanding.",
    "EmoBench: Evaluating the Emotional Intelligence of Large Language Models": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the need for robust, comprehensive, and challenging benchmarks. Yet, research on evaluating their Emotional Intelligence (EI) is considerably limited. Existing benchmarks have two major shortcomings: first, they mainly focus on emotion recognition, neglecting essential EI capabilities such as emotion regulation and thought facilitation through emotion understanding; second, they are primarily constructed from existing datasets, which include frequent patterns, explicit information, and annotation errors, leading to unreliable evaluation. We propose EMOBENCH, a benchmark that draws upon established psychological theories and proposes a comprehensive definition for machine EI, including Emotional Understanding and Emotional Application. EMOBENCH includes a set of 400 hand-crafted questions in English and Chinese, which are meticulously designed to require thorough reasoning and understanding. Our findings reveal a considerable gap between the EI of existing LLMs and the average human, highlighting a promising direction for future research. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/Sahandfer/EmoBench.",
    "EmotionQueen: A Benchmark for Evaluating Empathy of Large Language Models": "Emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs) is of great importance in Natural Language Processing. However, the previous research mainly focuses on basic sentiment analysis tasks, such as emotion recognition, which is not enough to evaluate LLMs' overall emotional intelligence. Therefore, this paper presents a novel framework named EmotionQueen for evaluating the emotional intelligence of LLMs. The framework includes four distinctive tasks: Key Event Recognition, Mixed Event Recognition, Implicit Emotional Recognition, and Intention Recognition. LLMs are requested to recognize important event or implicit emotions and generate empathetic response. We also design two metrics to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in recognition and response for emotion-related statements. Experiments yield significant conclusions about LLMs' capabilities and limitations in emotion intelligence.",
    "EmpatheticFIG at WASSA 2024 Empathy and Personality Shared Task: Predicting Empathy and Emotion in Conversations with Figurative Language": "Recent research highlights the importance of figurative language as a tool for amplifying emotional impact. In this paper, we dive deeper into this phenomenon and outline our methods for Track 1, Empathy Prediction in Conversations (CONV-dialog) and Track 2, Empathy and Emotion Prediction in Conversation Turns (CONV-turn) of the WASSA 2024 shared task. We leveraged transformer-based large language models augmented with figurative language prompts, specifically idioms, metaphors, and hyperbole, that were selected and trained for each track to optimize system performance. For Track 1, we observed that a fine-tuned BERT with metaphor and hyperbole features outperformed other models on the development set. For Track 2, DeBERTa, with different combinations of figurative language prompts, performed well for different prediction tasks. Our method provides a novel framework for understanding how figurative language influences emotional perception in conversational contexts. Our system officially ranked 4th in the 1st track and 3rd in the 2nd track.",
    "EmpathyEar: An Open-source Avatar Multimodal Empathetic Chatbot": "This paper introduces EmpathyEar, a pioneering open-source, avatar-based multimodal empathetic chatbot, to fill the gap in traditional text-only empathetic response generation (ERG) systems. Leveraging the advancements of a large language model, combined with multimodal encoders and generators, EmpathyEar supports user inputs in any combination of text, sound, and vision, and produces multimodal empathetic responses, offering users, not just textual responses but also digital avatars with talking faces and synchronized speeches. A series of emotion-aware instruction-tuning is performed for comprehensive emotional understanding and generation capabilities. In this way, EmpathyEar provides users with responses that achieve a deeper emotional resonance, closely emulating human-like empathy. The system paves the way for the next emotional intelligence, for which we open-source the code for public access.",
    "Empowering Cross-lingual Abilities of Instruction-tuned Large Language Models by Translation-following Demonstrations": "The language ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is often unbalanced towards English because of the imbalance in the distribution of the pre-training data. This disparity is demanded in further fine-tuning and affecting the cross-lingual abilities of LLMs. In this paper, we propose to empower Instruction-tuned LLMs (It-LLMs) in languages other than English by building semantic alignment between them. Hence, we propose CrossAlpaca, an It-LLM with cross-lingual Instruction-following and Translation-following demonstrations to improve semantic alignment between languages. We validate our approach on the multilingual Question Answering (QA) benchmarks XQUAD and MLQA and adapted versions of MMLU and BBH. Our models, tested over six different languages, outperform the It-LLMs tuned on monolingual data. The final results show that instruction tuning on non-English data is not enough and that semantic alignment can be further improved by Translation-following demonstrations.",
    "Empowering Large Language Models for Textual Data Augmentation": "With the capabilities of understanding and executing natural language instructions, Large language models (LLMs) can potentially act as a powerful tool for textual data augmentation. However, the quality of augmented data depends heavily on the augmentation instructions provided, and the effectiveness can fluctuate across different downstream tasks. While manually crafting and selecting instructions can offer some improvement, this approach faces scalability and consistency issues in practice due to the diversity of downstream tasks. In this work, we address these limitations by proposing a new solution, which can automatically generate a large pool of augmentation instructions and select the most suitable task-informed instructions, thereby empowering LLMs to create high-quality augmented data for different downstream tasks. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently generates augmented data with better quality compared to non-LLM and LLM-based data augmentation methods, leading to the best performance on 26 few-shot learning tasks sourced from a wide range of application domains.",
    "Empowering the Future with Multilinguality and Language Diversity": "The rapid advancements and the widespread transformation of Large Language Models have made it necessary to incorporate these cutting-edge techniques into the educational curricula of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with limited computing resources. This paper presents an applied NLP course designed for upper-year computer science undergraduate students on state-of-the-art techniques with an emphasis on multilinguality and language diversity. We hope to empower learners in advancing their language community.",
    "Emulated Disalignment: Safety Alignment for Large Language Models May Backfire!": "Large language models (LLMs) undergo safety alignment to ensure safe conversations with humans. However, this paper introduces a training-free attack method capable of reversing safety alignment, converting the outcomes of stronger alignment into greater potential for harm by accessing only LLM output token distributions. Specifically, our method achieves this reversal by contrasting the output token distribution of a safety-aligned language model (e.g., Llama-2-chat) against its pre-trained version (e.g., Llama-2), so that the token predictions are shifted towards the opposite direction of safety alignment. We name this method emulated disalignment (ED) because sampling from this contrastive distribution provably emulates the result of fine-tuning to minimize a safety reward. Our experiments with ED across three evaluation datasets and four model families (Llama-1, Llama-2, Mistral, and Alpaca) show that ED doubles the harmfulness of pre-trained models and outperforms strong baselines, achieving the highest harmful rates in 43 out of 48 evaluation subsets by a large margin. Eventually, given ED's reliance on language model output token distributions, which particularly compromises open-source models, our findings highlight the need to reassess the open accessibility of language models, even if they have been safety-aligned.",
    "Engineering Conversational Search Systems: A Review of Applications, Architectures, and Functional Components": "Conversational search systems enable information retrieval via natural language interactions, with the goal of maximizing users' information gain over multiple dialogue turns. The increasing prevalence of conversational interfaces adopting this search paradigm challenges traditional information retrieval approaches, stressing the importance of better understanding the engineering process of developing these systems. We undertook a systematic literature review to investigate the links between theoretical studies and technical implementations of conversational search systems. Our review identifies real-world application scenarios, system architectures, and functional components. We consolidate our results by presenting a layered architecture framework and explaining the core functions of conversational search systems. Furthermore, we reflect on our findings in light of the rapid progress in large language models, discussing their capabilities, limitations, and directions for future research.",
    "Enhanced BioT5+ for Molecule-Text Translation: A Three-Stage Approach with Data Distillation, Diverse Training, and Voting Ensemble": "This paper presents our enhanced BioT5+ method for the Language + Molecules shared task at the ACL 2024 Workshop. The task involves “translating” between molecules and natural language, including molecule captioning and text-based molecule generation using the L+M-24 dataset. Our method consists of three stages. In the first stage, we distill data from various models. In the second stage, combined with extra version of the provided dataset, we train diverse models for subsequent voting ensemble. We also adopt Transductive Ensemble Learning (TEL) to enhance these base models. Lastly, all models are integrated using a voting ensemble method. Experimental results demonstrate that BioT5+ achieves superior performance on L+M-24 dataset. On the final leaderboard, our method (team name: qizhipei) ranks first in the text-based molecule generation task and second in the molecule captioning task, highlighting its efficacy and robustness in translating between molecules and natural language. The pre-trained BioT5+ models are available at https://github.com/QizhiPei/BioT5.",
    "Enhanced Financial Sentiment Analysis and Trading Strategy Development Using Large Language Models": "This study proposes a novel methodology for enhanced financial sentiment analysis and trading strategy development using large language models (LLMs) such as OPT, BERT, FinBERT, LLAMA 3 and RoBERTa. Utilizing a dataset of 965,375 U.S. financial news articles from 2010 to 2023, our research demonstrates that the GPT-3-based OPT model significantly outperforms other models, achieving a prediction accuracy of 74.4% for stock market returns. Our findings reveal that the advanced capabilities of LLMs, particularly OPT, surpass traditional sentiment analysis methods, such as the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model, in predicting and explaining stock returns. For instance, a self-financing strategy based on OPT scores achieves a Sharpe ratio of 3.05 over our sample period, compared to a Sharpe ratio of 1.23 for the strategy based on the dictionary model. This study highlights the superior performance of LLMs in financial sentiment analysis, encouraging further research into integrating artificial intelligence and LLMs in financial markets.",
    "Enhanced Language Model Truthfulness with Learnable Intervention and Uncertainty Expression": "Large language models (LLMs) can generate long-form and coherent text, yet they often hallucinate facts, which undermines their reliability. To mitigate this issue, inference-time methods steer LLM representations toward the “truthful directions” previously learned for truth elicitation. However, applying these truthful directions with the same intensity fails to generalize across different query contexts. We propose LITO, a Learnable Intervention method for Truthfulness Optimization that automatically identifies the optimal intervention intensity tailored to each specific context. LITO explores a sequence of model generations based on increasing levels of intervention intensities. It selects the most accurate response or refuses to answer when the predictions are highly uncertain. Experiments on multiple LLMs and question-answering datasets demonstrate that LITO improves truthfulness while preserving task accuracy. The adaptive nature of LITO counters the limitations of one-size-fits-all intervention methods, maximizing truthfulness by reflecting the model's internal knowledge only when it is confident.",
    "Enhanced Visual Instruction Tuning with Synthesized Image-Dialogue Data": "The remarkable multimodal capabilities demonstrated by OpenAI's GPT-4 have sparked significant interest in the development of multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs). A primary research objective of such models is to align visual and textual modalities effectively while comprehending human instructions. Current methodologies often rely on annotations derived from benchmark datasets to construct image-dialogue datasets for training purposes, akin to instruction tuning in LLMs. However, these datasets often exhibit domain bias, potentially constraining the generative capabilities of the models. In an effort to mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel methodology for data collection, which synchronously synthesizes images and dialogues for visual instruction tuning. This approach leverages the combined capabilities of generative text-to-image models and large language models, facilitating the creation of a dataset that is both diverse and scalable, and more importantly, customized to enhance the models' performance across a broad spectrum of tasks. Our research includes comprehensive experiments conducted on various datasets. The results emphasize substantial enhancements in more than ten commonly assessed capabilities. Additionally, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple widely recognized multimodal benchmarks.",
    "Enhancing Adverse Drug Event Detection with Multimodal Dataset: Corpus Creation and Model Development": "The mining of adverse drug events (ADEs) is pivotal in pharmacovigilance, enhancing patient safety by identifying potential risks associated with medications, facilitating early detection of adverse events, and guiding regulatory decision-making. Traditional ADE detection methods are reliable but slow, not easily adaptable to large-scale operations, and offer limited information. With the exponential increase in data sources like social media content, biomedical literature, and Electronic Medical Records (EMR), extracting relevant ADE-related information from these unstructured texts is imperative. Previous ADE mining studies have focused on text-based methodologies, overlooking visual cues, limiting contextual comprehension, and hindering accurate interpretation. To address this gap, we present a MultiModal Adverse Drug Event (MMADE) detection dataset, merging ADE-related textual information with visual aids. Additionally, we introduce a framework that leverages the capabilities of LLMs and VLMs for ADE detection by generating detailed descriptions of medical images depicting ADEs, aiding healthcare professionals in visually identifying adverse events. Using our MMADE dataset, we showcase the significance of integrating visual cues from images to enhance overall performance. This approach holds promise for patient safety, ADE awareness, and healthcare accessibility, paving the way for further exploration in personalized healthcare. The code and dataset used in this work are publicly available.",
    "Enhancing Cross Text-Molecule Learning by Self-Augmentation": "The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has greatly advanced the field of drug discovery, with the belief that natural language can enhance human control over molecule design. However, the scarcity of high-quality labeled data remains a challenge for cross text-molecule learning. Existing datasets are limited due to the difficulty of collecting precise molecule-description pairs. Although recent efforts have utilized pseudo data generated by LLMs for augmentation, the lack of specialized chemistry knowledge of LLMs and the absence of an effective high-quality data selector may introduce noise into the annotations, compromising the models' robustness. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel framework that interweaves model fine-tuning and data augmentation to overcome the scarcity of high-quality data. The proposed approach involves an iterative procedure where the model plays dual roles in annotating unlabeled data and sampling a subset of high-quality data until convergence is achieved, enhancing the model's understanding and adaptability. Additionally, a new dataset called SAPubChem-41 is presented, which comprises meticulously curated high-quality parallel molecule-description pairs designed specifically for fine-tuning purposes. This research provides an important contribution to the field by addressing the need for high-quality datasets and presenting an effective framework for cross text-molecule learning.",
    "Enhancing Dialogue State Tracking Models through LLM-backed User-Agents Simulation": "Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is designed to monitor the evolving dialogue state in the conversations and plays a pivotal role in developing task-oriented dialogue systems. However, obtaining the annotated data for the DST task is usually a costly endeavor. In this paper, we focus on employing LLMs to generate dialogue data to reduce dialogue collection and annotation costs. Specifically, GPT-4 is used to simulate the user and agent interaction, generating thousands of dialogues annotated with DST labels. Then a two-stage fine-tuning on LLaMA 2 is performed on the generated data and the real data for the DST prediction. Experimental results on two public DST benchmarks show that with the generated dialogue data, our model performs better than the baseline trained solely on real data. In addition, our approach is also capable of adapting to the dynamic demands in real-world scenarios, generating dialogues in new domains swiftly. After replacing dialogue segments in any domain with the corresponding generated ones, the model achieves comparable performance to the model trained on real data.",
    "Enhancing EEG-to-Text Decoding through Transferable Representations from Pre-trained Contrastive EEG-Text Masked Autoencoder": "Reconstructing natural language from non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) holds great promise as a language decoding technology for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG-based language decoding is still in its nascent stages, facing several technical issues such as: 1) Absence of a hybrid strategy that can effectively integrate cross-modality (between EEG and text) self-learning with intra-modality self-reconstruction of EEG features or textual sequences; 2) Under-utilization of large language models (LLMs) to enhance EEG-based language decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Contrastive EEG-Text Masked Autoencoder (CET-MAE), a novel model that orchestrates compound self-supervised learning across and within EEG and text through a dedicated multi-stream encoder. Furthermore, we develop a framework called E2T-PTR (EEG-to-Text decoding using Pretrained Transferable Representations), which leverages pre-trained modules alongside the EEG stream from CET-MAE and further enables an LLM (specifically BART) to decode text from EEG sequences. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the popular text-evoked EEG database, ZuCo, demonstrate the superiority of E2T-PTR, which outperforms the baseline framework in ROUGE-1 F1 and BLEU-4 scores by 8.34% and 32.21%, respectively. Our proposed pre-trained EEG-Text model shows the potential to improve downstream tasks involving EEG and text. This opens up promising avenues for its application in inner speech BCI paradigms, meriting further investigation.",
    "Enhancing Hallucination Detection through Perturbation-Based Synthetic Data Generation in System Responses": "Detecting hallucinations in large language model (LLM) outputs is pivotal, yet traditional fine-tuning for this classification task is impeded by the expensive and quickly outdated annotation process, especially across numerous vertical domains and in the face of rapid LLM advancements. In this study, we introduce an approach that automatically generates both faithful and hallucinated outputs by rewriting system responses. Experimental findings demonstrate that a T5-base model, fine-tuned on our generated dataset, surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot detectors and existing synthetic generation methods in both accuracy and latency, indicating efficacy of our approach.",
    "Enhancing In-Context Learning via Implicit Demonstration Augmentation": "The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) enables large pre-trained language models (PLMs) to make predictions for unseen inputs without updating parameters. Despite its potential, ICL's effectiveness heavily relies on the quality, quantity, and permutation of demonstrations, commonly leading to suboptimal and unstable performance. In this paper, we tackle this challenge for the first time from the perspective of demonstration augmentation. Specifically, we start with enriching representations of demonstrations by leveraging their deep feature distribution. We then theoretically reveal that when the number of augmented copies approaches infinity, the augmentation is approximately equal to a novel logit calibration mechanism integrated with specific statistical properties. This insight results in a simple yet highly efficient method that significantly improves the average and worst-case accuracy across diverse PLMs and tasks. Moreover, our method effectively reduces performance variance among varying demonstrations, permutations, and templates, and displays the capability to address imbalanced class distributions.",
    "Enhancing Large Language Models in Coding Through Multi-Perspective Self-Consistency": "Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable ability in code generation. However, generating the correct solution in a single attempt still remains a challenge. Prior works utilize verification properties in software engineering to verify and re-rank solutions in a majority voting manner. But the assumption behind them that generated verification properties have better qualities than solutions may not always hold. In this paper, we treat them equally as different perspectives of LLMs' reasoning processes. We propose the Multi-Perspective Self-Consistency (MPSC) framework incorporating both inter- and intra-consistency across outputs from multiple perspectives. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to generate diverse outputs from three perspectives, Solution, Specification and Test case, constructing a 3-partite graph. With two measure functions of consistency, we embed both inter- and intra-consistency information into the graph. The optimal choice of solutions is then determined based on analysis in the graph. MPSC significantly boosts performance of foundation models (ChatGPT in this paper) on various benchmarks, including HumanEval (+15.91%), MBPP (+6.43%) and CodeContests (+9.37%), even surpassing GPT-4.",
    "Enhancing Multilingual Capabilities of Large Language Models through Self-Distillation from Resource-Rich Languages": "While large language models (LLMs) have been pre-trained on multilingual corpora, their performance still lags behind in most languages compared to a few resource-rich languages. One common approach to mitigate this issue is to translate training data from resource-rich languages into other languages and then continue training. However, using the data obtained solely relying on translation while ignoring the original capabilities of LLMs across languages is not always effective, which we show will limit the performance of cross-lingual knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose SDRRL, a method based on Self-Distillation from Resource-Rich Languages that effectively improves multilingual performance by leveraging the internal capabilities of LLMs on resource-rich languages. We evaluate on different LLMs (LLaMA-2 and SeaLLM) and source languages (English and French) across various comprehension and generation tasks, experimental results demonstrate that SDRRL can significantly enhance multilingual capabilities while minimizing the impact on original performance in resource-rich languages.",
    "Enhancing Noise Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models with Adaptive Adversarial Training": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit substantial capabilities yet encounter challenges, including hallucination, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning processes. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution, integrating knowledge from external databases to mitigate these challenges. However, inappropriate retrieved passages can potentially hinder the LLMs' capacity to generate comprehensive and high-quality responses. Prior RAG studies on the robustness of retrieval noises often confine themselves to a limited set of noise types, deviating from real-world retrieval environments and limiting practical applicability. In this study, we initially investigate retrieval noises and categorize them into three distinct types, reflecting real-world environments. We analyze the impact of these various retrieval noises on the robustness of LLMs. Subsequently, we propose a novel RAG approach known as Retrieval-augmented Adaptive Adversarial Training (RAAT). RAAT leverages adaptive adversarial training to dynamically adjust the model's training process in response to retrieval noises. Concurrently, it employs multi-task learning to ensure the model's capacity to internally recognize noisy contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LLaMA-2 7B model trained using RAAT exhibits significant improvements in F1 and EM scores under diverse noise conditions. For reproducibility, we release our code and data at: https://github.com/calubkk/RAAT.",
    "Enhancing Numerical Reasoning with the Guidance of Reliable Reasoning Processes": "Numerical reasoning is an essential ability for NLP systems to handle numeric information. Recent research indicates that fine-tuning a small-scale model to learn generating reasoning processes alongside answers can significantly enhance performance. However, current methods have the limitation that most methods generate reasoning processes with large language models (LLMs), which are “unreliable” since such processes could contain information unrelated to the answer. To address this limitation, we introduce Enhancing NumeriCal reasOning with Reliable procEsses (ENCORE), which derives the reliable reasoning process by decomposing the answer formula, ensuring which fully supports the answer. Nevertheless, models could lack enough data to learn the reasoning process generation adequately, since our method generates only one single reasoning process for one formula. To overcome this difficulty, we present a series of pre-training tasks to help models learn the reasoning process generation with synthesized data. The experiments show that ENCORE yields improvement on all five experimental datasets with an average of 1.8%, proving the effectiveness of our method.",
    "Enhancing Reinforcement Learning with Label-Sensitive Reward for Natural Language Understanding": "Recent strides in large language models (LLMs) have yielded remarkable performance, leveraging reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to significantly enhance generation and alignment capabilities. However, RLHF encounters numerous challenges, including the objective mismatch issue, leading to suboptimal performance in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Label-sensitive Reward (RLLR) to amplify the performance of LLMs in NLU tasks. By incorporating label-sensitive pairs into reinforcement learning, our method aims to adeptly capture nuanced label-sensitive semantic features during RL, thereby enhancing natural language understanding. Experiments conducted on five diverse foundation models across eight tasks showcase promising results. In comparison to Supervised Fine-tuning models (SFT), RLLR demonstrates an average performance improvement of 1.54%. Compared with RLHF models, the improvement averages at 0.69%. These results reveal the effectiveness of our method for LLMs in NLU tasks.",
    "Enhancing Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models with In-Context Learning": "Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) have significantly improved performance in open-domain question answering (QA) by leveraging external knowledge. However, RALMs still struggle with unanswerable queries, where the retrieved contexts do not contain the correct answer, and with conflicting information, where different sources provide contradictory answers due to imperfect retrieval. This study introduces an in-context learning-based approach to enhance the reasoning capabilities of RALMs, making them more robust in imperfect retrieval scenarios. Our method incorporates Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) demonstrations, referred to as cases, to boost the model's capabilities to identify unanswerabilities and conflicts among the retrieved contexts. Experiments on two open-domain QA datasets show that our approach increases accuracy in identifying unanswerable and conflicting scenarios without requiring additional fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that in-context learning can effectively enhance the robustness of RALMs in open-domain QA tasks.",
    "Enhancing Semantic Consistency of Large Language Models through Model Editing: An Interpretability-Oriented Approach": "A Large Language Model (LLM) tends to generate inconsistent and sometimes contradictory outputs when presented with a prompt that has equivalent semantics but is expressed differently from the original prompt. To achieve semantic consistency of an LLM, one of the key approaches is to finetune the model with prompt-output pairs with semantically equivalent meanings. Despite its effectiveness, a data-driven finetuning method incurs substantial computation costs in data preparation and model optimization. In this regime, an LLM is treated as a “black box”, restricting our ability to gain deeper insights into its internal mechanism. In this paper, we are motivated to enhance the semantic consistency of LLMs through a more interpretable method (i.e., model editing) to this end. We first identify the model components (i.e., attention heads) that have a key impact on the semantic consistency of an LLM. We subsequently inject biases into the output of these model components along the semantic-consistency activation direction. It is noteworthy that these modifications are cost-effective, without reliance on mass manipulations of the original model parameters. Through comprehensive experiments on the constructed NLU and open-source NLG datasets, our method demonstrates significant improvements in the semantic consistency and task performance of LLMs. Additionally, our method exhibits promising generalization capabilities by performing well on tasks beyond the primary tasks.",
    "Enhancing Text-to-SQL Parsing through Question Rewriting and Execution-Guided Refinement": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based approach has become the mainstream for Text-to-SQL task and achieves remarkable performance. In this paper, we augment the existing prompt engineering methods by exploiting the database content and execution feedback. Specifically, we introduce DART-SQL, which comprises two key components: (1) Question Rewriting: DART-SQL rewrites natural language questions by leveraging database content information to eliminate ambiguity. (2) Execution-Guided Refinement: DART-SQL incorporates database content information and utilizes the execution results of the generated SQL to iteratively refine the SQL. We apply this framework to the two LLM-based approaches (DAIL-SQL and C3) and test it on four widely used benchmarks (Spider-dev, Spider-test, Realistic and DK). Experiments show that our framework for DAIL-SQL and C3 achieves an average improvement of 12.41% and 5.38%, respectively, in terms of the execution accuracy (EX) metric.",
    "Enhancing Translation Accuracy of Large Language Models through Continual Pre-Training on Parallel Data": "In this paper, we propose a two-phase training approach where pre-trained large language models are continually pre-trained on parallel data and then supervised fine-tuned with a small amount of high-quality parallel data. To investigate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted continual pre-training with a 3.8B-parameter model and parallel data across eight different formats. We evaluate these methods on thirteen test sets for Japanese-to-English and English-to-Japanese translation. The results demonstrate that when utilizing parallel data in continual pre-training, it is essential to alternate between source and target sentences. Additionally, we demonstrated that the translation accuracy improves only for translation directions where the order of source and target sentences aligns between continual pre-training data and inference. In addition, we demonstrate that the LLM-based translation model is more robust in translating spoken language and achieves higher accuracy with less training data compared to supervised encoder-decoder models. We also show that the highest accuracy is achieved when the data for continual pre-training consists of interleaved source and target sentences and when tags are added to the source sentences.",
    "EPFL-MAKE at Discharge Me!: An LLM System for Automatically Generating Discharge Summaries of Clinical Electronic Health Record": "This paper presents our contribution to the Streamlining Discharge Documentation shared task organized as part of the ACL'24 workshop. We propose MEDISCHARGE (MEditron-7B Based Medical Summary Generation System for DISCHARGE Me), an LLM-based system to generate Brief Hospital Course and Discharge Instruction summaries based on a patient's Electronic Health Record. Our system is built on a Meditron-7B with context window extension, ensuring the system can handle cases of variable lengths with high quality. When the length of the input exceeds the system input limitation, we use a dynamic information selection framework to automatically extract important sections from the full discharge text. Then, extracted sections are removed in increasing order of importance until the input length requirement is met. We demonstrate our approach outperforms tripling the size of the context window of the model. Our system obtains a 0.289 overall score in the leaderboard, an improvement of 183% compared to the baseline, and a ROUGE-1 score of 0.444, achieving a second place performance in the shared task.",
    "Episodic Memory Retrieval from LLMs: A Neuromorphic Mechanism to Generate Commonsense Counterfactuals for Relation Extraction": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved satisfactory performance in counterfactual generation. However, confined by the stochastic generation process of LLMs, there often are misalignments between LLMs and humans which hinder LLMs from handling complex tasks like relation extraction. As a result, LLMs may generate commonsense-violated counterfactuals like 'eggs were produced by a box'. To bridge this gap, we propose to mimic the episodic memory retrieval, the working mechanism of the human hippocampus, to align LLMs' generation process with that of humans. In this way, LLMs can derive experience from their extensive memory, which keeps in line with the way humans gain commonsense. We then implement two central functions in the hippocampus, i.e., pattern separation and pattern completion, to retrieve the episodic memory from LLMs and generate commonsense counterfactuals for relation extraction. Experimental results demonstrate the improvements of our framework over existing methods in terms of the quality of counterfactuals.",
    "Epistemology of Language Models: Do Language Models Have Holistic Knowledge?": "This paper investigates the inherent knowledge in language models from the perspective of epistemological holism. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether LLMs exhibit characteristics consistent with epistemological holism. These characteristics suggest that core knowledge, such as general scientific knowledge, each plays a specific role, serving as the foundation of our knowledge system and being difficult to revise. To assess these traits related to holism, we created a scientific reasoning dataset and examined the epistemology of language models through three tasks: Abduction, Revision, and Argument Generation. In the abduction task, the language models explained situations while avoiding revising the core knowledge. However, in other tasks, the language models were revealed not to distinguish between core and peripheral knowledge, showing an incomplete alignment with holistic knowledge principles.",
    "ERA-CoT: Improving Chain-of-Thought through Entity Relationship Analysis": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved commendable accomplishments in various natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still encounter significant challenges when dealing with complex scenarios involving multiple entities. These challenges arise from the presence of implicit relationships that demand multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel approach ERA-CoT, which aids LLMs in understanding context by capturing relationships between entities and supports the reasoning of diverse tasks through Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Experimental results show that ERA-CoT demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed method compared to current CoT prompting methods, achieving a significant improvement of an average of 5.1% on GPT3.5 compared to previous SOTA baselines. Our analysis indicates that ERA-CoT increases the LLM's understanding of entity relationships, significantly improves the accuracy of question answering, and enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs.",
    "Error Analysis Prompting Enables Human-Like Translation Evaluation in Large Language Models": "Generative large language models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across several NLP tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization. Recent research (Kocmi and Federmann, 2023b) has shown that utilizing LLMs for assessing the quality of machine translation (MT) achieves state-of-the-art performance at the system level but performs poorly at the segment level. To further improve the performance of LLMs on MT quality assessment, we conduct an investigation into several prompting designs, and propose a new prompting method called Error Analysis Prompting (EAPrompt) by combining Chain-of-Thoughts (Wei et al., 2022) and Error Analysis (Lu et al., 2023). This technique emulates the commonly accepted human evaluation framework - Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM, Freitag et al. (2021)) and produces explainable and reliable MT evaluations at both the system and segment level. Experimental Results from WMT22 metrics shared task validate the effectiveness of EAPrompt on various LLMs, with different structures. Further analysis confirms that EAPrompt effectively distinguishes major errors from minor ones, while also sharing a similar distribution of the number of errors with MQM. These findings highlight the potential of EAPrompt as a human-like evaluator prompting technique for MT evaluation.",
    "EtymoLink: A Structured English Etymology Dataset": "Etymology, and the field of lexicography, is often constrained by unstructured data formats buried in scholarly articles and dictionaries. This paper presents a methodology and an empirical study for creating a structured etymological dataset suitable for computational analysis. Using data from the Online Etymology Dictionary (Etymonline), we manually annotated a subset of entries to establish a high-quality ground-truth dataset and fine-tuned the FLAN-T5-base model to extract structured etymological relationships automatically. The resulting dataset contains over 103,000 relationships covering 63,603 English lexical terms. Our findings emphasise feasibility of using large language models for structuring lexicographical data, exploring the transferability of the model to other dictionary datasets with no additional manual annotation.",
    "Eulerian at BioLaySumm: Preprocessing Over Abstract is All You Need": "In this paper, we present our approach to the BioLaySumm 2024 Shared Task on Lay Summarization of Biomedical Research Articles at BioNLP workshop 2024 (Goldsack et al., 2024). The task aims to generate lay summaries from the abstract and main texts of biomedical research articles, making them understandable to lay audiences. We used some preprocessing techniques and finetuned Flan-T5 models for the summarization task. Our method achieved an AlignScore of 0.9914 and a SummaC metric score of 0.944. Notably, we scored the highest on the Factuality metric, composed of AlignScore and SummaC, among all the teams.",
    "Evaluating ChatNetZero, an LLM-Chatbot to Demystify Climate Pledges": "This paper introduces and evaluates ChatNetZero, a large-language model (LLM) chatbot developed through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which uses generative AI to produce answers grounded in verified, climate-domain specific information. We describe ChatNetZero's design, particularly the innovation of anti-hallucination and reference modules designed to enhance the accuracy and credibility of generated responses. To evaluate ChatNetZero's performance against other LLMs, including GPT-4, Gemini, Coral, and ChatClimate, we conduct two types of validation: comparing LLMs' generated responses to original source documents to verify their factual accuracy, and employing an expert survey to evaluate the overall quality, accuracy, and relevance of each response. We find that while ChatNetZero responses show higher factual accuracy when compared to original source data, experts surveyed prefer lengthier responses that provide more context. Our results highlight the importance of prioritizing information presentation in the design of domain-specific LLMs to ensure that scientific information is effectively communicated, especially as even expert audiences find it challenging to assess the credibility of AI-generated content.",
    "Evaluating Chinese Large Language Models on Discipline Knowledge Acquisition via Assessing Memorization and Robustness": "Chinese large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on NLP tasks, particularly on discipline knowledge benchmarks, where certain Chinese LLMs are very competitive to GPT-4. Previous research has viewed these advancements as potential outcomes of data contamination or leakage, prompting efforts to create new detection methods and address evaluation issues in LLM benchmarks. However, there has been a lack of comprehensive assessment of the evolution of Chinese LLMs. To bridge this gap, this paper offers a thorough investigation of Chinese LLMs on discipline knowledge evaluation, delving into the advancements of various LLMs, including a group of related models and others. Specifically, we have conducted six assessments ranging from knowledge memorization to comprehension for robustness, encompassing tasks like predicting incomplete questions and options, identifying behaviors by the contaminational fine-tuning, and answering rephrased questions. Experimental findings indicate a positive correlation between the release time of LLMs and their memorization capabilities, but they struggle with variations in original question-options pairs. Additionally, our findings suggest that question descriptions have a more significant impact on the performance of LLMs.",
    "Evaluating Dynamic Topic Models": "There is a lack of quantitative measures to evaluate the progression of topics through time in dynamic topic models (DTMs). Filling this gap, we propose a novel evaluation measure for DTMs that analyzes the changes in the quality of each topic over time. Additionally, we propose an extension combining topic quality with the model's temporal consistency. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed measure by applying it to synthetic data and data from existing DTMs, including DTMs from large language models (LLMs). We also show that the proposed measure correlates well with human judgment. Our findings may help in identifying changing topics, evaluating different DTMs and LLMs, and guiding future research in this area.",
    "Evaluating Extrapolation Ability of Large Language Model in Chemical Domain": "Solving a problem outside the training space, i.e. extrapolation, has been a long problem in the machine learning community. The current success of large language models demonstrates the LLM's extrapolation ability to several unseen tasks. In line with these works, we evaluate the LLM's extrapolation ability in the chemical domain. We construct a data set measuring the material properties of epoxy polymers depending on various raw materials and curing processes. LLM should predict the material property when novel raw material is introduced utilizing its chemical knowledge. Through experiments, LLM tends to choose the right direction of adjustment but fails to determine the exact degree, resulting in poor MAE on some properties. But LLM can successfully adjust the degree with only a one-shot example. The results show that LLM can extrapolate to new unseen material utilizing its chemical knowledge learned through massive pre-training.",
    "Evaluating Grammatical Well-Formedness in Large Language Models: A Comparative Study with Human Judgments": "Research in artificial intelligence has witnessed the surge of large language models (LLMs) demonstrating improved performance in various natural language processing tasks. This has sparked significant discussions about the extent to which large language models emulate human linguistic cognition and usage. This study delves into the representation of grammatical well-formedness in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of linguistic knowledge. In three preregistered experiments, we collected grammaticality judgment data for over 2400 English sentences with varying structures from ChatGPT and Vicuna, comparing them with human judgment data. The results reveal substantial alignment in the assessment of grammatical correctness between LLMs and human judgments, albeit with LLMs often showing more conservative judgments for grammatical correctness or incorrectness.",
    "Evaluating Intention Detection Capability of Large Language Models in Persuasive Dialogues": "We investigate intention detection in persuasive multi-turn dialogues employing the largest available Large Language Models (LLMs). Much of the prior research measures the intention detection capability of machine learning models without considering the conversational history. To evaluate LLMs' intention detection capability in conversation, we modified the existing datasets of persuasive conversation and created datasets using a multiple-choice paradigm. It is crucial to consider others' perspectives through their utterances when engaging in a persuasive conversation, especially when making a request or reply that is inconvenient for others. This feature makes the persuasive dialogue suitable for the dataset of measuring intention detection capability. We incorporate the concept of face acts, which categorize how utterances affect mental states. This approach enables us to measure intention detection capability by focusing on crucial intentions and to conduct comprehensible analysis according to intention types.",
    "Evaluating Large Language Model Biases in Persona-Steered Generation": "The task of persona-steered text generation requires large language models (LLMs) to generate text that reflects the distribution of views that an individual fitting a persona could have. People have multifaceted personas, but prior work on bias in LLM-generated opinions has only explored multiple-choice settings or one-dimensional personas. We define an incongruous persona as a persona with multiple traits where one trait makes its other traits less likely in human survey data, e.g. political liberals who support increased military spending. We find that LLMs are 9.7% less steerable towards incongruous personas than congruous ones, sometimes generating the stereotypical stance associated with its demographic rather than the target stance. Models that we evaluate that are fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are more steerable, especially towards stances associated with political liberals and women, but present significantly less diverse views of personas. We also find variance in LLM steerability that cannot be predicted from multiple-choice opinion evaluation. Our results show the importance of evaluating models in open-ended text generation, as it can surface new LLM opinion biases. Moreover, such a setup can shed light on our ability to steer models toward a richer and more diverse range of viewpoints.",
    "Evaluating Large Language Models for Health-related Queries with Presuppositions": "As corporations rush to integrate large language models (LLMs) to their search offerings, it is critical that they provide factually accurate information, that is robust to any presuppositions that a user may express. In this work, we introduce UPHILL, a dataset consisting of health-related queries with varying degrees of presuppositions. Using UPHILL, we evaluate the factual accuracy and consistency of InstructGPT, ChatGPT, GPT-4 and Bing Copilot models. We find that while model responses rarely contradict true health claims (posed as questions), all investigated models fail to challenge false claims. Alarmingly, responses from these models agree with 23-32% of the existing false claims, and 49-55% with novel fabricated claims. As we increase the extent of presupposition in input queries, responses from all models except Bing Copilot agree with the claim considerably more often, regardless of its veracity. Given the moderate factual accuracy, and the inability of models to challenge false assumptions, our work calls for a careful assessment of current LLMs for use in high-stakes scenarios.",
    "Evaluating Large Language Models for Predicting Protein Behavior under Radiation Exposure and Disease Conditions": "The primary concern with exposure to ionizing radiation is the risk of developing diseases. While high doses of radiation can cause immediate damage leading to cancer, the effects of low-dose radiation (LDR) are less clear and more controversial. To further investigate this, it necessitates focusing on the underlying biological structures affected by radiation. Recent work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can effectively predict protein structures and other biological properties. The aim of this research is to utilize open-source LLMs, such as Mistral, Llama 2, and Llama 3, to predict both radiation-induced alterations in proteins and the dynamics of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) within the presence of specific diseases. We show that fine-tuning these models yields state-of-the-art performance for predicting protein interactions in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, and cancer. Our findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to understand the complex relationships between radiation exposure and disease mechanisms, illustrating the nuanced capabilities and limitations of current computational models.",
    "Evaluating Large Language Models on Social Signal Sensitivity: An Appraisal Theory Approach": "We present a framework to assess the sensitivity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to textually embedded social signals using an Appraisal Theory perspective. We report on an experiment that uses prompts encoding three dimensions of social signals: Affect, Judgment, and Appreciation. In response to the prompt, an LLM generates both an analysis (Insight) and a conversational Response, which are analyzed in terms of sensitivity to the signals. We quantitatively evaluate the output text through topical analysis of the Insight and predicting the social intelligence scores of the Response in terms of empathy and emotional polarity. Key findings show that LLMs are more sensitive to positive signals. The personas impact Responses but not the Insight. We discuss how our framework can be extended to a broader set of social signals, personas, and scenarios to evaluate LLM behaviors under various conditions.",
    "Evaluating Large Language Models on Wikipedia-Style Survey Generation": "Educational materials such as survey articles in specialized fields like computer science traditionally require tremendous expert inputs and are therefore expensive to create and update. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various general tasks. However, their effectiveness and limitations in the education domain are yet to be fully explored. In this work, we examine the proficiency of LLMs in generating succinct survey articles specific to the niche field of NLP in computer science, focusing on a curated list of 99 topics. Automated benchmarks reveal that GPT-4 surpasses its predecessors, including GPT-3.5, PaLM2, and LLaMa2 by margins ranging from 2% to 20% in comparison to the established ground truth. We compare both human and GPT-based evaluation scores and provide in-depth analysis. While our findings suggest that GPT-created surveys are more contemporary and accessible than human-authored ones, certain limitations were observed. Notably, GPT-4, despite often delivering outstanding content, occasionally exhibited lapses like missing details or factual errors. At last, we compared the rating behavior between humans and GPT-4 and found systematic bias in using GPT evaluation.",
    "Evaluating Lexical Aspect with Large Language Models": "In this study, we explore the proficiency of large language models (LLMs) in understanding two key lexical aspects: duration (durative/stative) and telicity (telic/atelic). Through experiments on datasets featuring sentences, verbs, and verb positions, we prompt the LLMs to identify aspectual features of verbs in sentences. Our findings reveal that certain LLMs, particularly those closed-source ones, are able to capture information on duration and telicity, albeit with some performance variations and weaker results compared to the baseline. By employing prompts at three levels (sentence-only, sentence with verb, and sentence with verb and its position), we demonstrate that integrating verb information generally enhances performance in aspectual feature recognition, though it introduces instability. We call for future research to look deeper into methods aimed at optimizing LLMs for aspectual feature comprehension.",
    "Evaluating LLMs' Mathematical Reasoning in Financial Document Question Answering": "Large Language Models (LLMs), excel in natural language understanding, but their capability for complex mathematical reasoning with a hybrid of structured tables and unstructured text remain uncertain. This study explores LLMs' mathematical reasoning on four financial tabular question-answering datasets: TATQA, FinQA, ConvFinQA, and Multihiertt. Through extensive experiments with various models and prompting techniques, we assess how LLMs adapt to complex tables and mathematical tasks. We focus on sensitivity to table complexity and performance variations with an increasing number of arithmetic reasoning steps. The results provide insights into LLMs' capabilities and limitations in handling complex mathematical scenarios for semi-structured tables. Ultimately, we introduce a novel prompting technique EEDP tailored to semi-structured documents, matching or outperforming baselines performance while providing a nuanced understanding of LLMs abilities.",
    "Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning of Large Language Models: A Focus on Error Identification and Correction": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the realm of mathematical reasoning necessitates comprehensive evaluations to gauge progress and inspire future directions. Existing assessments predominantly focus on problem-solving from the examinee perspective, overlooking a dual perspective of examiner regarding error identification and correction. From the examiner perspective, we define four evaluation tasks for error identification and correction along with a new dataset with annotated error types and steps. We also design diverse prompts to thoroughly evaluate eleven representative LLMs. Our principal findings indicate that GPT-4 outperforms all models, while open-source model LLaMA-2-7B demonstrates comparable abilities to closed-source models GPT-3.5 and Gemini Pro. Notably, calculation error proves the most challenging error type. Moreover, prompting LLMs with the error types can improve the average correction accuracy by 47.9%. These results reveal potential directions for developing the mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code and dataset is available on https://github.com/LittleCirc1e/EIC.",
    "Evaluating Robustness of Generative Search Engine on Adversarial Factoid Questions": "Generative search engines have the potential to transform how people seek information online, but generated responses from existing large language models (LLMs)-backed generative search engines may not always be accurate. Nonetheless, retrieval-augmented generation exacerbates safety concerns, since adversaries may successfully evade the entire system by subtly manipulating the most vulnerable part of a claim. To this end, we propose evaluating the robustness of generative search engines in the realistic and high-risk setting, where adversaries have only black-box system access and seek to deceive the model into returning incorrect responses. Through a comprehensive human evaluation of various generative search engines, such as Bing Chat, PerplexityAI, and YouChat across diverse queries, we demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial factual questions in inducing incorrect responses. Moreover, retrieval-augmented generation exhibits a higher susceptibility to factual errors compared to LLMs without retrieval. These findings highlight the potential security risks of these systems and emphasize the need for rigorous evaluation before deployment. Our constructed dataset and codes are available at: https://github.com/HKUSTGZ-NLP/Adversarial-Attack.",
    "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models in Scientiﬁc Document Reasoning": "Despite the dramatic progress in Large Language Model (LLM) development, LLMs often provide seemingly plausible but not factual information, often referred to as hallucinations. Retrieval-augmented LLMs provide a non-parametric approach to solve these issues by retrieving relevant information from external data sources and augment the training process. These models help to trace evidence from an externally provided knowledge base allowing the model predictions to be better interpreted and verified. In this work, we critically evaluate these models in their ability to perform in scientific document reasoning tasks. To this end, we tuned multiple such model variants with science-focused instructions and evaluated them on a scientific document reasoning benchmark for the usefulness of the retrieved document passages. Our findings suggest that models justify predictions in science tasks with fabricated evidence and leveraging scientific corpus as pretraining data does not alleviate the risk of evidence fabrication.",
    "Evaluating the Elementary Multilingual Capabilities of Large Language Models with MULTIQ": "Large language models (LLMs) should benefit everyone, including a global majority of non-English speakers. However, most LLMs today, and open LLMs in particular, are often intended for use in just English (e.g. Llama2, Mistral) or a small handful of high-resource languages (e.g. Mixtral, Qwen). Recent research shows that, despite limits in their intended use, people prompt LLMs in many different languages. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the basic multilingual capabilities of state-of-the-art open LLMs beyond their intended use. For this purpose, we introduce MULTIQ, a new silver standard benchmark for basic open-ended question answering with 27.4k test questions across a typologically diverse set of 137 languages. With MULTIQ, we evaluate language fidelity, i.e. whether models respond in the prompted language, and question answering accuracy. All LLMs we test respond faithfully and/or accurately for at least some languages beyond their intended use. Most models are more accurate when they respond faithfully. However, differences across models are large, and there is a long tail of languages where models are neither accurate nor faithful. We explore differences in tokenization as a potential explanation for our findings, identifying possible correlations that warrant further investigation.",
    "Evaluating the Smooth Control of Attribute Intensity in Text Generation with LLMs": "Controlling the attribute intensity of text generation is crucial across scenarios (e.g., writing conciseness, chatting emotion, and explanation clarity). The remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text generation, prompting us to explore such smooth control of LLM generation. Specifically, we propose metrics to assess the range, calibration, and consistency of the generated text's attribute intensity in response to varying control values, as well as its relevance to the intended context. To quantify the attribute intensity and context relevance, we propose an effective evaluation framework leveraging the Elo rating system and GPT4, both renowned for their robust alignment with human judgment. We look into two viable training-free methods for achieving smooth control of LLMs: (1) Prompting with semantic shifters, and (2) Modifying internal model representations. The evaluations of these two methods are conducted on 5 different attributes with various models. Our code and dataset can be obtained from https://github.com/ShangDataLab/Smooth-Control.",
    "Evaluating the Validity of Word-level Adversarial Attacks with Large Language Models": "Deep neural networks exhibit vulnerability to word-level adversarial attacks in natural language processing. Most of these attack methods adopt synonymous substitutions to perturb original samples for crafting adversarial examples while attempting to maintain semantic consistency with the originals. Some of them claim that they could achieve over 90% attack success rate, thereby raising serious safety concerns. However, our investigation reveals that many purportedly successful adversarial examples are actually invalid due to significant changes in semantic meanings compared to their originals. Even when equipped with semantic constraints such as BERTScore, existing attack methods can generate up to 87.9% invalid adversarial examples. Building on this insight, we first curate a 13K dataset for adversarial validity evaluation with the help of GPT-4. Then, an open-source large language model is fine-tuned to offer an interpretable validity score for assessing the semantic consistency between original and adversarial examples. Finally, this validity score can serve as a guide for existing adversarial attack methods to generate valid adversarial examples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in evaluating and refining the quality of adversarial examples.",
    "Evaluating Very Long-Term Conversational Memory of LLM Agents": "Existing works on long-term open-domain dialogues focus on evaluating model responses within contexts spanning no more than five chat sessions. Despite advancements in long-context large language models (LLMs) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques, their efficacy in very long-term dialogues remains unexplored. To address this research gap, we introduce a machine-human pipeline to generate high-quality, very long-term dialogues by leveraging LLM-based agent architectures and grounding their dialogues on personas and temporal event graphs. Moreover, we equip each agent with the capability of sharing and reacting to images. The generated conversations are verified and edited by human annotators for long-range consistency and grounding to the event graphs. Using this pipeline, we collect LOCOMO, a dataset of very long-term conversations, each encompassing approx. 600 turns and 16K tokens on avg., over up to 32 sessions. Based on LOCOMO, we present a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to measure long-term memory in models, encompassing question answering, event summarization, and multi-modal dialogue generation tasks. Our experimental results indicate that LLMs exhibit challenges in understanding lengthy conversations and comprehending long-range temporal and causal dynamics within dialogues. Employing strategies like long-context LLMs or RAG can offer improvements but these models still substantially lag behind human performance.",
    "Evaluating Vision-Language Models on Bistable Images": "Bistable images, also known as ambiguous or reversible images, present visual stimuli that can be seen in two distinct interpretations, though not simultaneously, by the observer. In this study, we conduct the most extensive examination of vision-language models using bistable images to date. We manually gathered a dataset of 29 bistable images, along with their associated labels, and subjected them to 121 different manipulations in brightness, tint, rotation, and resolution. We evaluated twelve different models in both classification and generative tasks across six model architectures. Our findings reveal that, with the exception of models from the Idefics family and LLaVA1.5-13b, there is a pronounced preference for one interpretation over another among the models, and minimal variance under image manipulations, with few exceptions on image rotations. Additionally, we compared the models' preferences with humans, noting that the models do not exhibit the same continuity biases as humans and often diverge from human initial interpretations. We also investigated the influence of variations in prompts and the use of synonymous labels, discovering that these factors significantly affect model interpretations more than image manipulations showing a higher influence of the language priors on bistable image interpretations compared to image-text training data.

    "Every Answer Matters: Evaluating Commonsense with Probabilistic Measures": "Large language models have demonstrated impressive performance on commonsense tasks; however, these tasks are often posed as multiple-choice questions, allowing models to exploit systematic biases (Li et al., 2022). Commonsense is also inherently probabilistic with multiple correct answers. The purpose of “boiling water” could be making tea, cooking but also could be killing germs. Existing tasks do not capture the probabilistic nature of common sense. To this end, we present commonsense frame completion (CFC), a new generative task that evaluates common sense via multiple open-ended generations. We also propose a method of probabilistic evaluation that strongly correlates with human judgments. Humans drastically outperform strong language model baselines on our dataset, indicating this approach is both a challenging and useful evaluation of machine common sense.",
    "Everything of Thoughts: Defying the Law of Penrose Triangle for Thought Generation": "This paper introduces a novel thought prompting approach called “Everything of Thoughts” (XOT) for Large Language Models (LLMs) to defy the law of “Penrose triangle” of existing thought paradigms, to achieve three key perspectives in thought generation simultaneously: performance, efficiency, and flexibility. XOT leverages pretrained reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to incorporate external domain knowledge and planning capability into thoughts, thereby enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities. Through the MCTS-LLM collaborative thought revision framework, XOT autonomously produces high-quality comprehensive cognitive mappings with minimal LLM interactions. Additionally, XOT empowers LLMs to utilize flexible cognitive mappings for solving problems with multiple solutions. We evaluate XOT on several challenging problem-solving tasks, including Game of 24, 8-Puzzle, and Pocket Cube. Our results demonstrate that XOT significantly outperforms existing approaches in various dimensions, showcasing its remarkable proficiency in addressing complex problems across diverse domains. The data and code are available at https://github.com/microsoft/Everything-of-Thoughts-XoT.",
    "EVIT: Event-Oriented Instruction Tuning for Event Reasoning": "Events refer to specific occurrences, incidents, or happenings that take place under a particular background. Event reasoning aims to infer events according to certain relations and predict future events. The cutting-edge techniques for event reasoning play a crucial role in various natural language processing applications. Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in event reasoning owing to their wealth of knowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, smaller instruction-tuned models currently in use do not consistently demonstrate exceptional proficiency in managing these tasks. This discrepancy arises from the absence of explicit modeling of events and the interconnections of them within their instruction data. Consequently, these models face challenges in comprehending event structures and semantics while struggling to bridge the gap between their interpretations and human understanding of events. Additionally, their limitations in grasping event relations lead to constrained event reasoning abilities to effectively deduce and incorporate pertinent event knowledge. In this paper, we propose Event-Oriented Instruction Tuning to train our LLM named EVIT specializing in event reasoning tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel structure named event quadruple which contains the structure and semantics of events and is complete in the event representation. We then design event-relation learning based on the structures. We encapsulate the learning into the instruction-tuning formulation to better stimulate the event reasoning capacity of our model. We design a heuristic unsupervised method to mine event quadruple from a large-scale corpus. At last, we finetune a Llama model on our Event-Oriented Instruction Tuning. We conduct extensive experiments on event reasoning tasks on several datasets. Automatic and human evaluations demonstrate EVIT achieves competitive performances on event reasoning.",
    "Evolutionary Reward Design and Optimization with Multimodal Large Language Models": "Designing reward functions is a pivotal yet challenging task for Reinforcement Learning (RL) practices, often demanding domain expertise and substantial effort. Recent studies have explored the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate reward functions via evolutionary search techniques (Ma et al., 2023). However, these approaches overlook the potential of multimodal information, such as images and videos. In particular, prior methods predominantly rely on numerical feedback from the RL environment for doing evolution, neglecting the incorporation of visual data obtained during training. This study introduces a novel approach by employing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to craft reward functions tailored for various RL tasks. The methodology involves providing MLLM with the RL environment's code alongside its image as context and task information to generate reward candidates. Then, the chosen agent undergoes training, and the numerical feedback from the environment, along with the recorded video of the top-performing policy, is provided as feedback to the MLLM. By employing an iterative feedback mechanism through evolutionary search, MLLM consistently refines the reward function to maximize accuracy. Testing on two different agents points to the preeminence of our approach over previous methodology, which themselves outperformed 83% (Ma et al., 2023) of reward functions designed by human experts.",
    "Ex3: Automatic Novel Writing by Extracting, Excelsior and Expanding": "Generating long-term texts such as novels using artificial intelligence has always been a challenge. A common approach is to use large language models (LLMs) to construct a hierarchical framework that first plans and then writes. Despite the fact that the generated novels reach a sufficient length, they exhibit poor logical coherence and appeal in their plots and deficiencies in character and event depiction, ultimately compromising the overall narrative quality. In this paper, we propose a method named Extracting Excelsior and Expanding. Ex3 initially extracts structure information from raw novel data. By combining this structure information with the novel data, an instruction-following dataset is meticulously crafted. This dataset is then utilized to fine-tune the LLM, aiming for excelsior generation performance. In the final stage, a tree-like expansion method is deployed to facilitate the generation of arbitrarily long novels. Evaluation against previous methods showcases Ex3's ability to produce higher-quality long-form novels.",
    "Examining the robustness of LLM evaluation to the distributional assumptions of benchmarks": "Benchmarks have emerged as the central approach for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). The research community often relies on a model's average performance across the test prompts of a benchmark to evaluate the model's performance. This is consistent with the assumption that the test prompts within a benchmark represent a random sample from a real-world distribution of interest. We note that this is generally not the case; instead, we hold that the distribution of interest varies according to the specific use case. We find that (1) the correlation in model performance across test prompts is non-random, (2) accounting for correlations across test prompts can change model rankings on major benchmarks, (3) explanatory factors for these correlations include semantic similarity and common LLM failure points.",
    "EXAMS-V: A Multi-Discipline Multilingual Multimodal Exam Benchmark for Evaluating Vision Language Models": "We introduce EXAMS-V, a new challenging multi-discipline multimodal multilingual exam benchmark for evaluating vision language models. It consists of 20,932 multiple-choice questions across 20 school disciplines covering natural science, social science, and other miscellaneous studies, e.g., religion, fine arts, business, etc. EXAMS-V includes a variety of multimodal features such as text, images, tables, figures, diagrams, maps, scientific symbols, and equations. The questions come in 11 languages from 7 language families. Unlike existing benchmarks, EXAMS-V is uniquely curated by gathering school exam questions from various countries, with a variety of education systems. This distinctive approach calls for intricate reasoning across diverse languages and relies on region-specific knowledge. Solving the problems in the dataset requires advanced perception and joint reasoning over the text and the visual content of the image. Our evaluation results demonstrate that this is a challenging dataset, which is difficult even for advanced vision-text models such as GPT-4V and Gemini; this underscores the inherent complexity of the dataset and its significance as a future benchmark.",
    "Expedited Training of Visual Conditioned Language Generation via Redundancy Reduction": "In this paper, we introduce EVLGen, a streamlined framework designed for the pre-training of visually conditioned language generation models with high computational demands, utilizing frozen pre-trained large language models (LLMs). The conventional approach in vision-language pre-training (VLP) typically involves a two-stage optimization process: an initial resource-intensive phase dedicated to general-purpose vision-language representation learning, focused on extracting and consolidating relevant visual features. This is followed by a subsequent phase that emphasizes end-to-end alignment between visual and linguistic modalities. Our novel one-stage, single-loss framework bypasses the computationally demanding first training stage by gradually merging similar visual tokens during training, while avoiding model collapse caused by single-stage training of BLIP-2 type models. The gradual merging process effectively condenses visual information while preserving semantic richness, resulting in rapid convergence without compromising performance. Our experimental findings demonstrate that our approach accelerates the training of vision-language models by a factor of 5 without a noticeable impact on overall performance. Furthermore, we illustrate that our models significantly narrow the performance gap to current vision-language models using only 1/10 of the data. Finally, we showcase how our image-text models can seamlessly adapt to video-conditioned language generation tasks through novel soft attentive temporal token contextualizing modules.",
    "Experiential Co-Learning of Software-Developing Agents": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have brought significant changes to various domains, especially through LLM-driven autonomous agents. A representative scenario is in software development, where LLM agents demonstrate efficient collaboration, task division, and assurance of software quality, markedly reducing the need for manual involvement. However, these agents frequently perform a variety of tasks independently, without benefiting from past experiences, which leads to repeated mistakes and inefficient attempts in multi-step task execution. To this end, we introduce Experiential Co-Learning, a novel LLM-agent learning framework in which instructor and assistant agents gather shortcut-oriented experiences from their historical trajectories and use these past experiences for future task execution. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the framework enables agents to tackle unseen software-developing tasks more effectively. We anticipate that our insights will guide LLM agents towards enhanced autonomy and contribute to their evolutionary growth in cooperative learning. The code and data are available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev.",
    "Explanation-aware Soft Ensemble Empowers Large Language Model In-context Learning": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various natural language understanding tasks with a few demonstration examples via in-context learning. Common strategies to boost such “in-context” learning ability are to ensemble multiple model decoded results and require the model to generate an explanation along with the prediction. However, these models often treat different class predictions equally and neglect the potential discrepancy between the explanations and predictions. To fully unleash the power of explanations, we propose EASE, an Explanation-Aware Soft Ensemble framework to empower in-context learning with LLMs. We design two techniques, explanation-guided ensemble, and soft probability aggregation, to mitigate the effect of unreliable explanations and improve the consistency between explanations and final predictions. Experiments on 10 NLU tasks and 4 varying-size LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",
    "Exploiting Positional Bias for Query-Agnostic Generative Content in Search": "In recent years, research shows that neural ranking models (NRMs) substantially outperform their lexical counterparts in text retrieval. However, as neural approaches become increasingly prevalent as the final scoring component of engines or as standalone systems, their robustness to malicious text and, more generally, semantic perturbation needs to be better understood. We posit that the transformer attention mechanism can induce exploitable defects in search models through sensitivity to token position within a sequence, leading to an attack that could generalise beyond a single query or topic. We demonstrate such defects by showing that non-relevant text-such as promotional content-can be easily injected into a document without adversely affecting its position in search results. Unlike previous gradient-based attacks, we demonstrate the existence of these biases in a query-agnostic fashion. In doing so, without the knowledge of topicality, we can still reduce the negative effects of non-relevant content injection by controlling injection position. Our experiments are conducted with simulated on-topic promotional text automatically generated by prompting LLMs with topical context from target documents. We find that contextualisation of a non-relevant text further reduces negative effects whilst likely circumventing existing content filtering mechanisms. In contrast, lexical models are found to be more resilient to such content injection attacks. We then investigate a simple yet effective compensation for the weaknesses of the NRMs in search, validating our hypotheses regarding transformer bias.",
    "Exploiting Target Language Data for Neural Machine Translation Beyond Back Translation": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) encounters challenges when translating in new domains and low-resource languages. To address these issues, researchers have proposed methods to integrate additional knowledge into NMT, such as translation memories (TMs). However, finding TMs that closely match the input sentence remains challenging, particularly in specific domains. On the other hand, monolingual data is widely accessible in most languages, and back-translation is seen as a promising approach for utilizing target language data. Nevertheless, it still necessitates additional training. In this paper, we introduce Pseudo-kNN-MT, a variant of k-nearest neighbor machine translation (kNN-MT) that utilizes target language data by constructing a pseudo datastore. Furthermore, we investigate the utility of large language models (LLMs) for the kNN component. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach exhibits strong domain adaptation capability in both high-resource and low-resource machine translation. Notably, LLMs are found to be beneficial for robust NMT systems.",
    "Explore Spurious Correlations at the Concept Level in Language Models for Text Classification": "Language models (LMs) have achieved notable success in numerous NLP tasks, employing both fine-tuning and in-context learning (ICL) methods. While language models demonstrate exceptional performance, they face robustness challenges due to spurious correlations arising from imbalanced label distributions in training data or ICL exemplars. Previous research has primarily concentrated on word, phrase, and syntax features, neglecting the concept level, often due to the absence of concept labels and difficulty in identifying conceptual content in input texts. This paper introduces two main contributions. First, we employ ChatGPT to assign concept labels to texts, assessing concept bias in models during fine-tuning or ICL on test data. We find that LMs, when encountering spurious correlations between a concept and a label in training or prompts, resort to shortcuts for predictions. Second, we introduce a data rebalancing technique that incorporates ChatGPT-generated counterfactual data, thereby balancing label distribution and mitigating spurious correlations. Our method's efficacy, surpassing traditional token removal approaches, is validated through extensive testing.",
    "Exploring Chain-of-Thought for Multi-modal Metaphor Detection": "Metaphors are commonly found in advertising and internet memes. However, the free form of internet memes often leads to a lack of high-quality textual data. Metaphor detection demands a deep interpretation of both textual and visual elements, requiring extensive common-sense knowledge, which poses a challenge to language models. To address these challenges, we propose a compact framework called C4MMD, which utilizes a Chain-of-Thought(CoT) method for Multi-modal Metaphor Detection. Specifically, our approach designs a three-step process inspired by CoT that extracts and integrates knowledge from Multi-modal Large Language Models(MLLMs) into smaller ones. We also developed a modality fusion architecture to transform knowledge from large models into metaphor features, supplemented by auxiliary tasks to improve model performance. Experimental results on the MET-MEME dataset demonstrate that our method not only effectively enhances the metaphor detection capabilities of small models but also outperforms existing models. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study leveraging MLLMs in metaphor detection tasks.",
    "Exploring Collaboration Mechanisms for LLM Agents: A Social Psychology View": "As Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are increasingly employed in intricate social environments, a pressing query emerges: Can these NLP systems mirror human-esque collaborative intelligence, in a multi-agent society consisting of multiple large language models (LLMs)? This paper probes the collaboration mechanisms among contemporary NLP systems by melding practical experiments with theoretical insights. We fabricate four unique 'societies' comprised of LLM agents, where each agent is characterized by a specific 'trait' (easy-going or over-confident) and engages in collaboration with a distinct 'thinking pattern' (debate or reflection). Through evaluating these multi-agent societies on three benchmark datasets, we discern that certain collaborative strategies not only outshine previous top-tier approaches but also optimize efficiency (using fewer API tokens). Moreover, our results further illustrate that LLM agents manifest human-like social behaviors, such as conformity and consensus reaching, mirroring foundational social psychology theories. In conclusion, we integrate insights from social psychology to contextualize the collaboration of LLM agents, inspiring further investigations into the collaboration mechanism for LLMs. We have shared our code and datasets, hoping to catalyze further research in this promising avenue.",
    "Exploring Defeasibility in Causal Reasoning": "Defeasibility in causal reasoning implies that the causal relationship between cause and effect can be strengthened or weakened. Namely, the causal strength between cause and effect should increase or decrease with the incorporation of strengthening arguments (supporters) or weakening arguments (defeaters), respectively. However, existing works ignore defeasibility in causal reasoning and fail to evaluate existing causal strength metrics in defeasible settings. In this work, we present δ-CAUSAL, the first benchmark dataset for studying defeasibility in causal reasoning. δ-CAUSAL includes around 11K events spanning ten domains, featuring defeasible causality pairs, namely, cause-effect pairs accompanied by supporters and defeaters. We further show that current causal strength metrics fail to reflect the change of causal strength with the incorporation of supporters or defeaters in δ-CAUSAL. To this end, we propose CESAR (Causal Embedding aSsociation with Attention Rating), a metric that measures causal strength based on token-level causal relationships. CESAR achieves a significant 69.7% relative improvement over existing metrics, increasing from 47.2% to 80.1% in capturing the causal strength change brought by supporters and defeaters. We further demonstrate even Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 still lag 4.5 and 10.7 points behind humans in generating supporters and defeaters, emphasizing the challenge posed by δ-CAUSAL.",
    "Exploring Mathematical Extrapolation of Large Language Models with Synthetic Data": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown excellent performance in language understanding, text generation, code synthesis, and many other tasks, while they still struggle in complex multi-step reasoning problems, such as mathematical reasoning. In this paper, through a newly proposed arithmetical puzzle problem, we show that the model can perform well on multi-step reasoning tasks via fine-tuning on high-quality synthetic data. Experimental results with the open-llama-3B model on three different test datasets show that not only the model can reach a zero-shot pass@1 at 0.44 on the in-domain dataset, it also demonstrates certain generalization capabilities on the out-of-domain datasets. Specifically, this paper has designed two out-of-domain datasets in the form of extending the numerical range and the composing components of the arithmetical puzzle problem separately. The fine-tuned models have shown encouraging performance on these two far more difficult tasks with the zero-shot pass@1 at 0.33 and 0.35, respectively.",
    "Exploring Memorization in Fine-tuned Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown great capabilities in various tasks but also exhibited memorization of training data, raising tremendous privacy and copyright concerns. While prior works have studied memorization during pre-training, the exploration of memorization during fine-tuning is rather limited. Compared to pre-training, fine-tuning typically involves more sensitive data and diverse objectives, thus may bring distinct privacy risks and unique memorization behaviors. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis to explore language models' (LMs) memorization during fine-tuning across tasks. Our studies with open-sourced and our own fine-tuned LMs across various tasks indicate that memorization presents a strong disparity among different fine-tuning tasks. We provide an intuitive explanation of this task disparity via sparse coding theory and unveil a strong correlation between memorization and attention score distribution.",
    "Exploring Precision and Recall to assess the quality and diversity of LLMs": "We introduce a novel evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLAMA-2 and MISTRAL, focusing on importing Precision and Recall metrics from image generation to text generation. This approach allows for a nuanced assessment of the quality and diversity of generated text without the need for aligned corpora. By conducting a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, the study reveals new insights into their performance on open-ended generation tasks, which are not adequately captured by traditional benchmarks. The findings highlight a trade-off between the quality and diversity of generated samples, particularly when models are fine-tuned on instruction dataset or with human feedback. This work extends the toolkit for distribution-based NLP evaluation, offering insights into the practical capabilities and challenges that current LLMs face in generating diverse and high-quality text. We release our code and data.",
    "Exploring Reasoning Biases in Large Language Models Through Syllogism: Insights from the NeuBAROCO Dataset": "This paper explores the question of how accurately current large language models can perform logical reasoning in natural language, with an emphasis on whether these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans. Specifically, our study focuses on syllogistic reasoning, a form of deductive reasoning extensively studied in cognitive science as a natural form of human reasoning. We present a syllogism dataset called NeuBAROCO, which consists of syllogistic reasoning problems in English and Japanese. This dataset was originally designed for psychological experiments to assess human reasoning capabilities using various forms of syllogisms. Our experiments with leading large language models indicate that these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans, along with other error tendencies. Notably, there is significant room for improvement in reasoning problems where the relationship between premises and hypotheses is neither entailment nor contradiction. We also present experimental results and in-depth analysis using a new Chain-of-Thought prompting method, which asks LLMs to translate syllogisms into abstract logical expressions and then explain their reasoning process. Our analysis using this method suggests that the primary limitations of LLMs lie in the reasoning process itself rather than the interpretation of syllogisms.",
    "Exploring Reversal Mathematical Reasoning Ability for Large Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) have presented remarkable capabilities in the wide range of natural language understanding and reasoning tasks. Despite their success, a few works indicate that LLMs suffer from the “reversal curse”, in which LLMs can't employ the inverted structure “B is A” when they are trained based on “A is B”. To explore the effect of the “reversal curse” for LLMs on complex mathematical reasoning tasks, we present two reversal datasets upon GSM8K and MathQA and verify that LLMs also struggle to solve reversal mathematical problems. We analyze the potential reason and attribute it to the insufficient modeling of the relationship between reasoning steps caused by the left-to-right objective. Consequently, based on the characteristics of multi-step reasoning, we design a novel training method to improve the general and reversal reasoning abilities. Finally, we conduct experiments on four mathematical datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the general reasoning capacities and alleviates the reversal problem.",
    "Exploring Spatial Schema Intuitions in Large Language and Vision Models": "Despite the ubiquity of large language models (LLMs) in AI research, the question of embodiment in LLMs remains underexplored, distinguishing them from embodied systems in robotics where sensory perception directly informs physical action. Our investigation navigates the intriguing terrain of whether LLMs, despite their non-embodied nature, effectively capture implicit human intuitions about fundamental, spatial building blocks of language. We employ insights from spatial cognitive foundations developed through early sensorimotor experiences, guiding our exploration through the reproduction of three psycholinguistic experiments. Surprisingly, correlations between model outputs and human responses emerge, revealing adaptability without a tangible connection to embodied experiences. Notable distinctions include polarized language model responses and reduced correlations in vision language models. This research contributes to a nuanced understanding of the interplay between language, spatial experiences, and the computations made by large language models.",
    "Exploring the Potential of Dense Information in Multimodal Alignment": "Despite the success of data augmentation in improving Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, existing methods that utilize large language model (LLM) or Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enrich the information in captions still suffer from several limitations, including insufficient detail and excessive hallucinations, ultimately resulting in compromised alignment and masking the true potential of dense information. This can lead to erroneous conclusions about CLIP's ability to handle rich data, impeding the development of more effective models. To address the limitations of existing methods, we introduce a novel pipeline that generates highly detailed, factually accurate captions for images, which facilitates in-depth analysis of the potential for dense information in multimodal alignment. Contrary to previous findings, our investigation revealed that lengthening captions boosts performance across diverse benchmarks, even surpassing the effectiveness of meticulously crafted hard negative samples. Building on these insights, DELIP is introduced, demonstrably enhancing both foundational multimodal alignment and compositional reasoning abilities. Finally, we explore strategies to expand the context window of the text encoder, unlocking the potential of richer data for CLIP and paving the way for advancements in leveraging dense information for multimodal alignment.",
    "Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models in Computational Argumentation": "Computational argumentation has become an essential tool in various domains, including law, public policy, and artificial intelligence. It is an emerging research field in natural language processing that attracts increasing attention. Research on computational argumentation mainly involves two types of tasks: argument mining and argument generation. As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding context and generating natural language, it is worthwhile to evaluate the performance of LLMs on diverse computational argumentation tasks. This work aims to embark on an assessment of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, Flan models, and LLaMA2 models, in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. We organize existing tasks into six main categories and standardize the format of fourteen openly available datasets. In addition, we present a new benchmark dataset on counter speech generation that aims to holistically evaluate the end-to-end performance of LLMs on argument mining and argument generation. Extensive experiments show that LLMs exhibit commendable performance across most of the datasets, demonstrating their capabilities in the field of argumentation. Our analysis offers valuable suggestions for evaluating computational argumentation and its integration with LLMs in future research endeavors.",
    "Extending Context Window of Large Language Models via Semantic Compression": "Transformer based Large Language Models (LLMs) often impose limitations on the length of the text input to ensure the generation of fluent and relevant responses due to the quadratic complexity. These constraints restrict their applicability in long text scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic compression method that enables generalization to texts that are 6-8 times longer without incurring significant computational costs or requiring fine-tuning. Our proposed framework draws inspiration from source coding in information theory and employs a pre-trained model to reduce the semantic redundancy of long inputs before passing them to the LLMs for downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively extends the context window of LLMs across a range of tasks including question answering, summarization, few-shot learning, and information retrieval. Furthermore, the proposed semantic compression method exhibits consistent fluency in text generation while reducing the associated computational overhead.",
    "Extracting and Encoding: Leveraging Large Language Models and Medical Knowledge to Enhance Radiological Text Representation": "Advancing representation learning in specialized fields like medicine remains challenging due to the scarcity of expert annotations for text and images. To tackle this issue, we present a novel two-stage framework designed to extract high-quality factual statements from free-text radiology reports in order to improve the representations of text encoders and, consequently, their performance on various downstream tasks. In the first stage, we propose a Fact Extractor that leverages large language models (LLMs) to identify factual statements from well-curated domain-specific datasets. In the second stage, we introduce a Fact Encoder (CXRFE) based on a BERT model fine-tuned with objective functions designed to improve its representations using the extracted factual data. Our framework also includes a new embedding-based metric (CXRFEScore) for evaluating chest X-ray text generation systems, leveraging both stages of our approach. Extensive evaluations show that our fact extractor and encoder outperform current state-of-the-art methods in tasks such as sentence ranking, natural language inference, and label extraction from radiology reports. Additionally, our metric proves to be more robust and effective than existing metrics commonly used in the radiology report generation literature. The code of this project is available at https://github.com/PabloMessina/CXR-Fact-Encoder.",
    "Extracting Epilepsy Patient Data with Llama 2": "We fill a gap in scholarship by applying a generative Large Language Model (LLM) to extract information from clinical free text about the frequency of seizures experienced by people with epilepsy. Seizure frequency is difficult to determine across time from unstructured doctors' and nurses' reports of outpatients' visits that are stored in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS). We employ Meta's Llama 2 to mine the EHRs of people with epilepsy and determine, where possible, a person's seizure frequency at a given point in time. The results demonstrate that the new, powerful generative LLMs may improve outcomes for clinical NLP research in epilepsy and other areas.",
    "Extracting Polymer Nanocomposite Samples from Full-Length Documents": "This paper investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) for extracting sample lists of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) from full-length materials science research papers. The challenge lies in the complex nature of PNC samples, which have numerous attributes scattered throughout the text. The complexity of annotating detailed information on PNCs limits the availability of data, making conventional document-level relation extraction techniques impractical due to the challenge in creating comprehensive named entity span annotations. To address this, we introduce a new benchmark and an evaluation technique for this task and explore different prompting strategies in a zero-shot manner. We also incorporate self-consistency to improve the performance. Our findings show that even advanced LLMs struggle to extract all of the samples from an article. Finally, we analyze the errors encountered in this process, categorizing them into three main challenges, and discuss potential strategies for future research to overcome them.",
    "F-Eval: Assessing Fundamental Abilities with Refined Evaluation Methods": "Large language models (LLMs) garner significant attention for their unprecedented performance, leading to an increasing number of researches evaluating LLMs. However, these evaluation benchmarks are limited to assessing the instruction-following capabilities, overlooking the fundamental abilities that emerge during the pre-training stage. Previous subjective evaluation methods mainly rely on scoring by API models. However, in the absence of references, large models have shown limited ability to discern subtle differences. To bridge the gap, we propose F-Eval, a bilingual evaluation benchmark to evaluate the fundamental abilities, including expression, common-sense and logic. The tasks in F-Eval include multi-choice objective tasks, open-ended objective tasks, reference-based subjective tasks and reference-free subjective tasks. For reference-free subjective tasks, we devise new evaluation methods, serving as alternatives to scoring by API models. We conduct evaluations on 13 advanced LLMs. Results show that our evaluation methods show higher correlation coefficients and larger distinction than other evaluators. Additionally, we discuss the influence of different model sizes, dimensions, and normalization methods. We anticipate that F-Eval will facilitate the study of LLMs' fundamental abilities.",
    "Fact-and-Reflection (FaR) Improves Confidence Calibration of Large Language Models": "For a LLM to be trustworthy, its confidence level should be well calibrated with its actual performance. While it is now common sense that LLM performances are greatly impacted by prompts, the confidence calibration in prompting LLMs has yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we explore how different prompting strategies influence LLM confidence calibration and how it could be improved. We conduct extensive experiments on six prompting methods in the question-answering context and we observe that, while these methods help improve the expected LLM calibration, they also trigger LLMs to be over-confident when responding to some instances. Inspired by human cognition, we propose Fact-and-Reflection (FaR) prompting, which improves the LLM calibration in two steps. First, FaR elicits the known “facts” that are relevant to the input prompt from the LLM. And then it asks the model to “reflect” over them to generate the final answer. Experiments show that FaR prompting achieves significantly better calibration; it lowers the Expected Calibration Error by 23.5% on our multi-purpose QA tasks. Notably, FaR prompting even elicits the capability of verbally expressing concerns in less confident scenarios, which helps trigger retrieval augmentation for solving these harder instances.",
    "Fact-Checking the Output of Large Language Models via Token-Level Uncertainty Quantification": "Large language models (LLMs) are notorious for hallucinating, i.e., producing erroneous claims in their output. Such hallucinations can be dangerous, as occasional factual inaccuracies in the generated text might be obscured by the rest of the output being generally factually correct, making it extremely hard for the users to spot them. Current services that leverage LLMs usually do not provide any means for detecting unreliable generations. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we propose a novel fact-checking and hallucination detection pipeline based on token-level uncertainty quantification. Uncertainty scores leverage information encapsulated in the output of a neural network or its layers to detect unreliable predictions, and we show that they can be used to fact-check the atomic claims in the LLM output. Moreover, we present a novel token-level uncertainty quantification method that removes the impact of uncertainty about what claim to generate on the current step and what surface form to use. Our method Claim Conditioned Probability (CCP) measures only the uncertainty of a particular claim value expressed by the model. Experiments on the task of biography generation demonstrate strong improvements for CCP compared to the baselines for seven LLMs and four languages. Human evaluation reveals that the fact-checking pipeline based on uncertainty quantification is competitive with a fact-checking tool that leverages external knowledge.",
    "FACTPICO: Factuality Evaluation for Plain Language Summarization of Medical Evidence": "Plain language summarization with LLMs can be useful for improving textual accessibility of technical content. But how factual are these summaries in a high-stakes domain like medicine? This paper presents FACTPICO, a factuality benchmark for plain language summarization of medical texts describing randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which are the basis of evidence-based medicine and can directly inform patient treatment. FACTPICO consists of 345 plain language summaries of RCT abstracts generated from three LLMs (i.e., GPT-4, Llama-2, and Alpaca), with fine-grained evaluation and natural language rationales from experts. We assess the factuality of critical elements of RCTs in those summaries: Populations, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes (PICO), as well as the reported findings concerning these. We also evaluate the correctness of the extra information (e.g., explanations) added by LLMs. Using FACTPICO, we benchmark a range of existing factuality metrics, including the newly devised ones based on LLMs. We find that plain language summarization of medical evidence is still challenging, especially when balancing between simplicity and factuality, and that existing metrics correlate poorly with expert judgments on the instance level.",
    "Factual Confidence of LLMs: on Reliability and Robustness of Current Estimators": "Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to be unreliable in the factuality of their answers. To address this problem, NLP researchers have proposed a range of techniques to estimate LLM's confidence over facts. However, due to the lack of a systematic comparison, it is not clear how the different methods compare to one another. To fill this gap, we present a survey and empirical comparison of estimators of factual confidence. We define an experimental framework allowing for fair comparison, covering both fact-verification and question answering. Our experiments across a series of LLMs indicate that trained hidden-state probes provide the most reliable confidence estimates, albeit at the expense of requiring access to weights and training data. We also conduct a deeper assessment of factual confidence by measuring the consistency of model behavior under meaning-preserving variations in the input. We find that the confidence of LLMs is often unstable across semantically equivalent inputs, suggesting that there is much room for improvement of the stability of models' parametric knowledge.",
    "Faithful Logical Reasoning via Symbolic Chain-of-Thought": "While the recent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique enhances the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) with the theory of mind, it might still struggle in handling logical reasoning that relies much on symbolic expressions and rigid deducing rules. To strengthen the logical reasoning capability of LLMs, we propose a novel Symbolic Chain-of-Thought, namely SymbCoT, a fully LLM-based framework that integrates symbolic expressions and logic rules with CoT prompting. Technically, building upon an LLM, SymbCoT 1) first translates the natural language context into the symbolic format, and then 2) derives a step-by-step plan to solve the problem with symbolic logical rules, 3) followed by a verifier to check the translation and reasoning chain. Via thorough evaluations on 5 standard datasets with both First-Order Logic and Constraint Optimization symbolic expressions, SymbCoT shows striking improvements over the CoT method consistently, meanwhile refreshing the current state-of-the-art performances. We further demonstrate that our system advances in more faithful, flexible, and explainable logical reasoning. To our knowledge, this is the first to combine symbolic expressions and rules into CoT for logical reasoning with LLMs. Code is open at https://github.com/Aiden0526/SymbCoT.",
    "Faithful Persona-based Conversational Dataset Generation with Large Language Models": "High-quality conversational datasets are essential for developing AI models that can communicate with users. One way to foster deeper interactions between a chatbot and its user is through personas, aspects of the user's character that provide insights into their personality, motivations, and behaviors. Training Natural Language Processing (NLP) models on a diverse and comprehensive persona-based dataset can lead to conversational models that create a deeper connection with the user, and maintain their engagement. In this paper, we leverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a large, high-quality conversational dataset from a seed dataset. We propose a Generator-Critic architecture framework to expand the initial dataset, while improving the quality of its conversations. The Generator is an LLM prompted to output conversations. The Critic consists of a mixture of expert LLMs that control the quality of the generated conversations. These experts select the best generated conversations, which we then use to improve the Generator. We release Synthetic-Persona-Chat1, consisting of 20k conversations seeded from Persona-Chat (Zhang et al., 2018). We evaluate the quality of Synthetic-Persona-Chat and our generation framework on different dimensions through extensive experiments, and observe that the losing rate of Synthetic-Persona-Chat against Persona-Chat during an AI detection test decreases from 17.2% to 8.8% over three iterations.",
    "FanOutQA: A Multi-Hop, Multi-Document Question Answering Benchmark for Large Language Models": "One type of question that is commonly found in day-to-day scenarios is “fan-out” questions, complex multi-hop, multi-document reasoning questions that require finding information about a large number of entities. However, there exist few resources to evaluate this type of question-answering capability among large language models. To evaluate complex reasoning in LLMs more fully, we present FanOutQA, a high-quality dataset of fan-out question-answer pairs and human-annotated decompositions with English Wikipedia as the knowledge base. We formulate three benchmark settings across our dataset and benchmark 7 LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 2, Claude-2.1, and Mixtral-8x7B, finding that contemporary models still have room to improve reasoning over inter-document dependencies in a long context. We provide our dataset and open-source tools to run models to encourage evaluation.",
    "Fantastic Semantics and Where to Find Them: Investigating Which Layers of Generative LLMs Reflect Lexical Semantics": "Large language models have achieved remarkable success in general language understanding tasks. However, as a family of generative methods with the objective of next token prediction, the semantic evolution with the depth of these models are not fully explored, unlike their predecessors, such as BERT-like architectures. In this paper, we specifically investigate the bottom-up evolution of lexical semantics for a popular LLM, namely Llama2, by probing its hidden states at the end of each layer using a contextualized word identification task. Our experiments show that the representations in lower layers encode lexical semantics, while the higher layers, with weaker semantic induction, are responsible for prediction. This is in contrast to models with discriminative objectives, such as mask language modeling, where the higher layers obtain better lexical semantics. The conclusion is further supported by the monotonic increase in performance via the hidden states for the last meaningless symbols, such as punctuation, in the prompting strategy.",
    "Fast Randomized Low-Rank Adaptation of Pre-trained Language Models with PAC Regularization": "Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) achieves parameter efficient fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs) by decomposing the model weight update into a pair of low-rank projection matrices. Yet, the memory overhead restricts it to scale up when the model size increases. We propose Randomized LoRA (RLoRA) which adopts Randomized Walsh-Hadamard Transform to achieve significant reduction in the size of trainable parameters compared to LoRA. At the same time, it allows a PAC-Bayes regularizer to be efficiently incorporated to improve generalization. We evaluate the effectiveness of RLoRA on LLMs RoBERTa, GPT-2 and LLaMA-7B using GLUE, E2E and math reasoning benchmarks. With a much lower memory requirement, RLoRA can give similar performance as the SOTA low-rank adaptation methods for these three tasks and significantly better performance under few-shot settings.",
    "FastGAS: Fast Graph-based Annotation Selection for In-Context Learning": "In-context learning (ICL) empowers large language models (LLMs) to tackle new tasks by using a series of training instances as prompts. Since generating the prompts needs to sample from a vast pool of instances and annotate them (e.g., add labels in classification task), existing methods have proposed to select a subset of unlabeled examples for annotation, thus enhancing the quality of prompts and concurrently mitigating annotation costs. However, these methods often require a long time to select instances due to their complexity, hindering their practical viability. To address this limitation, we propose a graph-based selection method, FastGAS, designed to efficiently identify high-quality instances while minimizing computational overhead. Initially, we construct a data similarity graph based on instance similarities. Subsequently, employing a graph partitioning algorithm, we partition the graph into pieces. Within each piece (i.e., subgraph), we adopt a greedy approach to pick the most representative nodes. By aggregating nodes from diverse pieces and annotating the corresponding instances, we identify a set of diverse and representative instances for ICL. Compared to prior approaches, our method not only exhibits superior performance on different tasks but also significantly reduces selection time. In addition, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in LLMs of larger sizes.",
    "Feature-Adaptive and Data-Scalable In-Context Learning": "In-context learning (ICL), which promotes inference with several demonstrations, has become a widespread paradigm to stimulate LLM capabilities for downstream tasks. Due to context length constraints, it cannot be further improved in spite of more training data, and general features directly from LLMs in ICL are not adaptive to the specific downstream task. In this paper, we propose a feature-adaptive and data-scalable in-context learning framework (FADS-ICL), which can leverage task-adaptive features to promote inference on the downstream task, with the supervision of beyond-context samples. Specifically, it first extracts general features of beyond-context samples via the LLM with ICL input form one by one, and introduces a task-specific modulator to perform feature refinement and prediction after fitting a specific downstream task. We conduct extensive experiments on FADS-ICL under varying data settings (4∼128 shots) and LLM scale (0.8∼70B) settings. Experimental results show that FADS-ICL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin under all settings, verifying the effectiveness and superiority of FADS-ICL. For example, under the 1.5B and 32 shots setting, FADS-ICL can achieve +14.3 average accuracy from feature adaptation over vanilla ICL on 10 datasets, with +6.2 average accuracy over the previous state-of-the-art method, and the performance can further improve with increasing training data. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/jiahaozhenbang/FADS-ICL.",
    "Feriji: A French-Zarma Parallel Corpus, Glossary & Translator": "Machine translation (MT) is a rapidly expanding field that has experienced significant advancements in recent years with the development of models capable of translating multiple languages with remarkable accuracy. However, the representation of African languages in this field still needs improvement due to linguistic complexities and limited resources. This applies to the Zarma language, a dialect of Songhay (of the Nilo-Saharan language family) spoken by over 5 million people across Niger and neighboring countries (Lewis et al., 2016). This paper introduces Feriji, the first robust French-Zarma parallel corpus and glossary designed for MT. The corpus, containing 61,085 sentences in Zarma and 42,789 in French, and a glossary of 4,062 words represents a significant step in addressing the need for more resources for Zarma. We fine-tune three large language models on our dataset, obtaining a BLEU score of 30.06 on the best-performing model. We further evaluate the models on human judgments of fluency, comprehension, and readability and the importance and impact of the corpus and models. Our contributions help to bridge a significant language gap and promote an essential and overlooked indigenous African language.",
    "Few-shot Dialogue Strategy Learning for Motivational Interviewing via Inductive Reasoning": "We consider the task of building a dialogue system that can motivate users to adopt positive lifestyle changes: Motivational Interviewing. Addressing such a task requires a system that can infer how to motivate a user effectively. We propose DIIR (Dialogue Strategy Learning via Inductive Reasoning), a framework that is capable of learning and applying conversation strategies in the form of natural language inductive rules from expert demonstrations. Automatic and human evaluation on instruction-following large language models show natural language strategy descriptions discovered by DIIR can improve active listening skills, reduce unsolicited advice, and promote more collaborative and less authoritative responses, outperforming various demonstration utilization methods.",
    "Few-shot Question Generation for Reading Comprehension": "According to the internationally recognized PIRLS (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) assessment standards, reading comprehension questions should require not only information retrieval, but also higher-order processes such as inferencing, interpreting and evaluation. However, these kinds of questions are often not available in large quantities for training question generation models. This paper investigates whether pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce higher-order questions. Human assessment on a Chinese dataset shows that few-shot LLM prompting generates more usable and higher-order questions than two competitive neural baselines.",
    "Few-shot Transfer Learning for Knowledge Base Question Answering: Fusing Supervised Models with In-Context Learning": "Existing Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) architectures are hungry for annotated data, which make them costly and time-consuming to deploy. We introduce the problem of few-shot transfer learning for KBQA, where the target domain offers only a few labeled examples, but a large labeled training dataset is available in a source domain. We propose a novel KBQA architecture called FuSIC-KBQA that performs KB-retrieval using multiple source-trained retrievers, re-ranks using an LLM and uses this as input for LLM few-shot in-context learning to generate logical forms. These are further refined using execution-guided feedback. Experiments over multiple source-target KBQA pairs of varying complexity show that FuSIC-KBQA significantly outperforms adaptations of SoTA KBQA models for this setting. Additional experiments show that FuSIC-KBQA also outperforms SoTA KBQA models in the in-domain setting when training data is limited.",
    "FinanceMATH: Knowledge-Intensive Math Reasoning in Finance Domains": "We introduce FinanceMATH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in solving knowledge-intensive math reasoning problems. Compared to prior works, this study features three core advancements. First, FinanceMATH includes 1,200 problems with a hybrid of textual and tabular content. These problems require college-level knowledge in the finance domain for effective resolution. Second, we provide expert-annotated, detailed solution references in Python program format, ensuring a high-quality benchmark for LLM assessment. We also construct a finance-domain knowledge bank and investigate various knowledge integration strategies. Finally, we evaluate a wide spectrum of 51 LLMs with both Chain-of-Thought and Program-of-Thought prompting methods. Our experimental results reveal that the current best-performing system (i.e., GPT-4o) achieves only 60.9% accuracy using CoT prompting, leaving substantial room for improvement. Moreover, while augmenting LLMs with external knowledge can improve model performance (e.g., 47.5% →54.5% for Gemini-1.5-Pro), their accuracy remains significantly lower than the estimated human expert performance of 92%. We believe that FinanceMATH can advance future research in the area of domain-specific knowledge retrieval and integration, particularly within the context of solving reasoning-intensive tasks.",
    "Financial Product Ontology Population with Large Language Models": "Ontology population, which aims to extract structured data to enrich domain-specific ontologies from unstructured text, typically faces challenges in terms of data scarcity and linguistic complexity, particularly in specialized fields such as retail banking. In this study, we investigate the application of large language models (LLMs) to populate domain-specific ontologies of retail banking products from Thai corporate documents. We compare traditional span-based approaches to LLMs-based generative methods, with different prompting techniques. Our findings reveal that while span-based methods struggle with data scarcity and the complex linguistic structure, LLMs-based generative approaches substantially outperform, achieving a 61.05% F1 score, with the most improvement coming from providing examples in the prompts. This improvement highlights the potential of LLMs for ontology population tasks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for structured information extraction, especially in low-resource language settings.",
    "Finding and Editing Multi-Modal Neurons in Pre-Trained Transformers": "Understanding the internal mechanisms by which multi-modal large language models (LLMs) interpret different modalities and integrate cross-modal representations is becoming increasingly critical for continuous improvements in both academia and industry. In this paper, we propose a novel method to identify key neurons for interpretability — how multi-modal LLMs bridge visual and textual concepts for captioning. Our method improves conventional works upon efficiency and applied range by removing needs of costly gradient computation. Based on those identified neurons, we further design a multi-modal knowledge editing method, beneficial to mitigate sensitive words or hallucination. For rationale of our design, we provide theoretical assumption. For empirical evaluation, we have conducted extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments. The results not only validate the effectiveness of our methods, but also offer insightful findings that highlight three key properties of multi-modal neurons: sensitivity, specificity, and causal-effect, to shed light for future research.",
    "Finding GPT-4 Prompting Strategies for Multiple Choice Questions": "In this paper, we present our solution to the TextGraphs-17 Shared Task on Text-Graph Representations for Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). GPT-4 alone, with chain-of-thought reasoning and a given set of answers, achieves an F1 score of 0.78. By employing subgraph size as a feature, Wikidata answer description as an additional context, and a question rephrasing technique, we further strengthen this result. These tricks help to answer questions that were not initially answered and to eliminate irrelevant, identical answers. We have managed to achieve an F1 score of 0.83 and took 2nd place, improving the score by 0.05 over the baseline. An open implementation of our method is available on GitHub.",
    "Findings of WASSA 2024 Shared Task on Empathy and Personality Detection in Interactions": "This paper presents the results of the WASSA 2024 shared task on predicting empathy, emotion, and personality in conversations and reactions to news articles. Participating teams were given access to a new, unpublished extension of the WASSA 2023 shared task dataset. This task is both multi-level and multi-modal: data is available at the person, essay, dialog, and dialog-turn levels and includes formal (news articles) and informal text (essays and dialogs), self-report data (personality and distress), and third-party annotations (empathy and emotion). The shared task included a new focus on conversations between humans and LLM-based virtual agents which occur immediately after reading and reacting to the news articles. Participants were encouraged to explore the multi-level and multi-modal nature of this data. Participation was encouraged in four tracks: (i) predicting the perceived empathy at the dialog level, (ii) predicting turn-level empathy, emotion polarity, and emotion intensity in conversations, (iii) predicting state empathy and distress scores, and (iv) predicting personality. In total, 14 teams participated in the shared task. We summarize the methods and resources used by the participating teams.",
    "Fine-Grained Image-Text Alignment in Medical Imaging Enables Explainable Cyclic Image-Report Generation": "Fine-grained vision-language models (VLM) have been widely used for inter-modality local alignment between the predefined fixed patches and textual words. However, in medical analysis, lesions exhibit varying sizes and positions, and using fixed patches may cause incomplete representations of lesions. Moreover, these methods provide explainability by using heatmaps to show the general image areas potentially associated with texts rather than specific regions, making their explanations not explicit and specific enough. To address these issues, we propose a novel Adaptive patch-word Matching (AdaMatch) model to correlate chest X-ray (CXR) image regions with words in medical reports and apply it to CXR-report generation to provide explainability for the generation process. AdaMatch exploits the fine-grained relation between adaptive patches and words to provide explanations of specific image regions with corresponding words. To capture the abnormal regions of varying sizes and positions, we introduce an Adaptive Patch extraction (AdaPatch) module to acquire adaptive patches for these regions adaptively. Aiming to provide explicit explainability for the CXR-report generation task, we propose an AdaMatch-based bidirectional LLM for Cyclic CXR-report generation (AdaMatch-Cyclic). It employs AdaMatch to obtain the keywords for CXR images and 'keypatches' for medical reports as hints to guide CXR-report generation. Extensive experiments on two publicly available CXR datasets validate the effectiveness of our method and its superior performance over existing methods.",
    "Fine-Grained Modeling of Narrative Context: A Coherence Perspective via Retrospective Questions": "This work introduces an original and practical paradigm for narrative comprehension, stemming from the characteristics that individual passages within narratives tend to be more cohesively related than isolated. Complementary to the common end-to-end paradigm, we propose a fine-grained modeling of narrative context, by formulating a graph dubbed NARCO, which explicitly depicts task-agnostic coherence dependencies that are ready to be consumed by various downstream tasks. In particular, edges in NARCO encompass free-form retrospective questions between context snippets, inspired by human cognitive perception that constantly reinstates relevant events from prior context. Importantly, our graph formalism is practically instantiated by LLMs without human annotations, through our designed two-stage prompting scheme. To examine the graph properties and its utility, we conduct three studies in narratives, each from a unique angle: edge relation efficacy, local context enrichment, and broader application in QA. All tasks could benefit from the explicit coherence captured by NARCO.",
    "Fine-tuning after Prompting: an Explainable Way for Classification": "Prompting is an alternative approach for utilizing pre-trained language models (PLMs) in classification tasks. In contrast to fine-tuning, prompting is more understandable for humans because it utilizes natural language to interact with the PLM, but it often falls short in terms of accuracy. While current research primarily focuses on enhancing the performance of prompting methods to compete with fine-tuning, we believe that these two approaches are not mutually exclusive, each having its strengths and weaknesses. In our study, we depart from the competitive view of prompting versus fine-tuning and instead combine them, introducing a novel method called F&P. This approach enables us to harness the advantages of Fine-tuning for accuracy and the explainability of Prompting simultaneously. Specifically, we reformulate the sample into a prompt and subsequently fine-tune a linear classifier on top of the PLM. Following this, we extract verbalizers according to the weight of this classifier. During the inference phase, we reformulate the sample in the same way and query the PLM. The PLM generates a word, which is then subject to a dictionary lookup by the verbalizer to obtain the prediction. Experiments show that keeping only 30 keywords for each class can achieve comparable performance as fine-tuning. On the other hand, both the prompt and verbalizers are constructed in natural language, making them fully understandable to humans. Hence, the F&P method offers an effective and transparent way to employ a PLM for classification tasks.",
    "Fine-tuning Language Models for Joint Rewriting and Completion of Code with Potential Bugs": "Handling drafty partial code remains a notable challenge in real-time code suggestion applications. Previous work has demonstrated shortcomings of large language models of code (CodeLLMs) in completing partial code with potential bugs. In this study, we view partial code as implementation hints and fine-tune CodeLLMs to jointly rewrite and complete partial code into functional full programs. We explore two strategies: one-pass generation and multi-pass iterative refinement. We construct new training and testing datasets using semantic-altering code transformations and iterative self-generations. We conduct comprehensive experiments over three representative open-sourced CodeLLMs - InCoder, CodeGen, and StarCoder. Results show that CodeLLMs fine-tuned using our approach achieve superior pass rates compared to the previous baselines across existing and newly-created benchmarks, effectively handle both potentially buggy and clean code, and largely preserve the integrity of the original partial implementations. We further present findings on the properties of the potential bugs we tested and on the design choices of our methods.",
    "Fine-tuning Language Models for Triple Extraction with Data Augmentation": "Advanced language models with impressive capabilities to process textual information can more effectively extract high-quality triples, which are the building blocks of knowledge graphs. Our work examines language models' abilities to extract entities and the relationships between them. We use a diverse data augmentation process to fine-tune large language models to extract triples from the text. Fine-tuning is performed using a mix of trainers from HuggingFace and five public datasets, such as different variations of the WebNLG, SKE, DocRed, FewRel, and KELM. Evaluation involves comparing model output with test set triples based on several criteria, such as type, partial, exact, and strict accuracy. The obtained results outperform ChatGPT and even match or exceed the performance of GPT-4.",
    "Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Language Models with Gaze Supervision": "Human gaze data provide cognitive information that reflect human language comprehension, and has been effectively integrated into a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, demonstrating improved performance over corresponding plain text-based models. In this work, we propose to integrate a gaze module into pre-trained language models (LMs) at the fine-tuning stage to improve their capabilities to learn representations that are grounded in human language processing. This is done by extending the conventional purely text-based fine-tuning objective with an auxiliary loss to exploit cognitive signals. The gaze module is only included during training, retaining compatibility with existing pre-trained LM-based pipelines. We evaluate the proposed approach using two distinct pre-trained LMs on the GLUE benchmark and observe that the proposed model improves performance compared to both standard fine-tuning and traditional text augmentation baselines. Our code is publicly available.",
    "Fine-tuning with HED-IT: The impact of human post-editing for dialogical language models": "Automatic methods for generating and gathering linguistic data have proven effective for fine-tuning Language Models (LMs) in languages less resourced than English. Still, while there has been emphasis on data quantity, less attention has been given to its quality. In this work, we investigate the impact of human intervention on machine-generated data when fine-tuning dialogical models. In particular, we study (1) whether post-edited dialogues exhibit higher perceived quality compared to the originals that were automatically generated; (2) whether fine-tuning with post-edited dialogues results in noticeable differences in the generated outputs; and (3) whether post-edited dialogues influence the outcomes when considering the parameter size of the LMs. To this end we created HED-IT, a large-scale dataset where machine-generated dialogues are paired with the version post-edited by humans. Using both the edited and unedited portions of HED-IT, we fine-tuned three different sizes of an LM. Results from both human and automatic evaluation show that the different quality of training data is clearly perceived and it has an impact also on the models trained on such data. Additionally, our findings indicate that larger models are less sensitive to data quality, whereas this has a crucial impact on smaller models. These results enhance our comprehension of the impact of human intervention on training data in the development of high-quality LMs.",
    "FineSurE: Fine-grained Summarization Evaluation using LLMs": "Automated evaluation is crucial for streamlining text summarization benchmarking and model development, given the costly and time-consuming nature of human evaluation. Traditional methods like ROUGE do not correlate well with human judgment, while recently proposed LLM-based metrics provide only summary-level assessment using Likert-scale scores. This limits deeper model analysis, e.g., we can only assign one hallucination score at the summary level, while at the sentence level, we can count sentences containing hallucinations. To remedy those limitations, we propose FineSurE, a fine-grained evaluator specifically tailored for the summarization task using large language models (LLMs). It also employs completeness and conciseness criteria, in addition to faithfulness, enabling multi-dimensional assessment. We compare various open-source and proprietary LLMs as backbones for FineSurE. In addition, we conduct extensive benchmarking of FineSurE against SOTA methods including NLI-, QA-, and LLM-based methods, showing improved performance especially on the completeness and conciseness dimensions. The code is available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/FineSurE-ACL24.",
    "FinTextQA: A Dataset for Long-form Financial Question Answering": "Accurate evaluation of financial question-answering (QA) systems necessitates a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse question types and contexts. However, current financial QA datasets lack scope diversity and question complexity. This work introduces FinTextQA, a novel dataset for long-form question answering (LFQA) in finance. FinTextQA comprises 1,262 high-quality, source-attributed QA pairs extracted and selected from finance textbooks and government agency websites. Moreover, we developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based LFQA system, comprising an embedder, retriever, reranker, and generator. A multi-faceted evaluation approach, including human ranking, automatic metrics, and GPT-4 scoring, was employed to benchmark the performance of different LFQA system configurations under heightened noisy conditions. The results indicate that: (1) Among all compared generators, Baichuan2-7B competes closely with GPT-3.5-turbo in accuracy score; (2) The most effective system configuration on our dataset involved setting the embedder, retriever, reranker, and generator as Ada2, Automated Merged Retrieval, Bge-Reranker-Base, and Baichuan2-7B, respectively; (3) models are less susceptible to noise after the length of contexts reaching a specific threshold. The dataset is publicly available.",
    "FinTral: A Family of GPT-4 Level Multimodal Financial Large Language Models": "We introduce FinTral, a suite of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (LLMs) built upon the Mistral-7b model and tailored for financial analysis. FinTral integrates textual, numerical, tabular, and image data. We present FinSet, the largest financial LLM pretraining, instruction tuning and financial alignment dataset and evaluation benchmark featuring nine tasks and 23 datasets and the first to understand and mitigate financial hallucinations. We enhance FinTral with domain-specific pretraining, instruction fine-tuning, and RLAIF training by exploiting a large collection of textual and visual datasets we curate for this work. We also introduce an extensive benchmark featuring nine tasks and 25 datasets for evaluation, including hallucinations in the financial domain. Our FinTral model trained with direct preference optimization employing advanced Tools and Retrieval methods, dubbed FinTral-DPO-T&R, demonstrates an exceptional zero-shot performance. It outperforms ChatGPT-3.5 in all tasks and surpasses GPT-4 in five out of nine tasks, marking a significant advancement in AI-driven financial technology. We also demonstrate that FinTral has the potential to excel in real-time analysis and decision-making in diverse financial contexts.",
    "FLEUR: An Explainable Reference-Free Evaluation Metric for Image Captioning Using a Large Multimodal Model": "Most existing image captioning evaluation metrics focus on assigning a single numerical score to a caption by comparing it with reference captions. However, these methods do not provide an explanation for the assigned score. Moreover, reference captions are expensive to acquire. In this paper, we propose FLEUR, an explainable reference-free metric to introduce explainability into image captioning evaluation metrics. By leveraging a large multimodal model, FLEUR can evaluate the caption against the image without the need for reference captions, and provide the explanation for the assigned score. We introduce score smoothing to align as closely as possible with human judgment and to be robust to user-defined grading criteria. FLEUR achieves high correlations with human judgment across various image captioning evaluation benchmarks and reaches state-of-the-art results on Flickr8k-CF, COMPOSITE, and Pascal-50S within the domain of reference-free evaluation metrics. Our source code and results are publicly available at: https://github.com/Yebin46/FLEUR.",
    "FlowVQA: Mapping Multimodal Logic in Visual Question Answering with Flowcharts": "Existing benchmarks for visual question answering lack in visual grounding and complexity, particularly in evaluating spatial reasoning skills. We introduce FlowVQA, a novel benchmark aimed at assessing the capabilities of visual question-answering multimodal language models in reasoning with flowcharts as visual contexts. FlowVQA comprises 2,272 carefully generated and human-verified flowchart images from three distinct content sources, along with 22,413 diverse question-answer pairs, to test a spectrum of reasoning tasks, including information localization, decision-making, and logical progression. We conduct a thorough baseline evaluation on a suite of both open-source and proprietary multimodal language models using various strategies, followed by an analysis of directional bias. The results underscore the benchmark's potential as a vital tool for advancing the field of multimodal modeling, providing a focused and challenging environment for enhancing model performance in visual and logical reasoning tasks.",
    "FOCUS: Forging Originality through Contrastive Use in Self-Plagiarism for Language Models": "Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have shown impressive results in various Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, such as powering chatbots and generating stories. However, an ethical concern arises due to their potential to produce verbatim copies of paragraphs from their training data. This is problematic as PLMs are trained on corpora constructed by human authors. As such, there is a pressing need for research to promote the generation of original content by these models. In this study, we introduce a unique “self-plagiarism” contrastive decoding strategy, aimed at boosting the originality of text produced by PLMs. Our method entails modifying prompts in LLMs to develop an amateur model and a professional model. Specifically, the amateur model is urged to plagiarize using three plagiarism templates we have designed, while the professional model maintains its standard language model status. This strategy employs prompts to stimulate the model's capacity to identify non-original candidate token combinations and subsequently impose penalties. The application of this strategy is integrated prior to the model's final layer, ensuring smooth integration with most existing PLMs (T5, GPT, LLaMA) without necessitating further adjustments. Implementing our strategy, we observe a significant decline in non-original sequences comprised of more than three words in the academic AASC dataset and the story-based ROCStories dataset.",
    "Focus on Your Question! Interpreting and Mitigating Toxic CoT Problems in Commonsense Reasoning": "Large language models exhibit high-level commonsense reasoning abilities, especially with enhancement methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, we find these CoT-like methods lead to a considerable number of originally correct answers turning wrong, which we define as the Toxic CoT problem. To interpret and mitigate this problem, we first utilize attribution tracing and causal tracing methods to probe the internal working mechanism of the LLM during CoT reasoning. Through comparisons, we prove that the model exhibits information loss from the question in the shallow attention layers when generating rationales or answers. Based on the probing results, we design a novel method called RIDERS (Residual decoding and sERial-position Swap), which compensates for the information deficit in the model from both decoding and serial-position perspectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks, we validate that this method not only significantly eliminates Toxic CoT problems (decreased by 23.6%), but also effectively improves the model's overall commonsense reasoning performance (increased by 5.5%).",
    "FOFO: A Benchmark to Evaluate LLMs' Format-Following Capability": "This paper presents FOFO, a pioneering benchmark for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) ability to follow complex, domain-specific formats, a crucial yet underexamined capability for their application as AI agents. Despite LLMs' advancements, existing benchmarks fail to assess their format-following proficiency adequately. FOFO fills this gap with a diverse range of real-world formats and instructions, developed through an AI-Human collaborative method. Our evaluation across both open-source (e.g., Llama 2, WizardLM) and closed-source (e.g., GPT-4, PALM2, Gemini) LLMs highlights three key findings: open-source models significantly lag behind closed-source ones in format adherence; LLMs' format-following performance is independent of their content generation quality; and LLMs' format proficiency varies across different domains. These insights suggest the need for specialized tuning for format-following skills and highlight FOFO's role in guiding the selection of domain-specific AI agents.",
    "FollowBench: A Multi-level Fine-grained Constraints Following Benchmark for Large Language Models": "The ability to follow instructions is crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle various real-world applications. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating pure response quality, rather than assessing whether the response follows constraints stated in the instruction. To fill this research gap, in this paper, we propose FollowBench, a Multi-level Fine-grained Constraints Following Benchmark for LLMs. FollowBench comprehensively includes five different types (i.e., Content, Situation, Style, Format, and Example) of fine-grained constraints. To enable a precise constraint following estimation on diverse difficulties, we introduce a Multi-level mechanism that incrementally adds a single constraint to the initial instruction at each increased level. To assess whether LLMs' outputs have satisfied every individual constraint, we propose to prompt strong LLMs with constraint-evolution paths to handle challenging open-ended instructions. By evaluating 13 closed-source and open-source popular LLMs on FollowBench, we highlight the weaknesses of LLMs in instruction following and point towards potential avenues for future work.",
    "Forecasting Uncertainty in Conversations using Large Language Models": "Effective interlocutors account for the uncertain goals, beliefs, and emotions of others. But even the best human conversationalist cannot perfectly anticipate the trajectory of a dialogue. How well can language models represent inherent uncertainty in conversations? We propose FortUne Dial, an expansion of the long-standing “conversation forecasting” task: instead of just accuracy, evaluation is conducted with uncertainty-aware metrics, effectively enabling abstention on individual instances. We study two ways in which language models potentially represent outcome uncertainty (internally, using scores and directly, using tokens) and propose fine-tuning strategies to improve calibration of both representations. Experiments on eight difficult negotiation corpora demonstrate that our proposed fine-tuning strategies (a traditional supervision strategy and an off-policy reinforcement learning strategy) can calibrate smaller open-source models to compete with pre-trained models 10x their size.",
    "Forgetting before Learning: Utilizing Parametric Arithmetic for Knowledge Updating in Large Language Models": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation. However, even stronger LLMs are susceptible to acquiring erroneous or obsolete information from the training corpus. Direct secondary fine-tuning with data containing new knowledge may be ineffective in updating knowledge due to the conflict between old and new knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for fine-tuning called F-Learning (Forgetting before Learning), which employs parametric arithmetic to facilitate the forgetting of old knowledge and learning of new knowledge. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed F-Learning can obviously improve the knowledge updating performance of both full fine-tuning and LoRA fine-tuning, simultaneously outperforming the existing baselines in most cases. Moreover, we have also discovered that forgetting old knowledge by subtracting the parameters of LoRA can yield a similar effect to subtracting the parameters of full fine-tuning, and occasionally even surpass it significantly.",
    "Fortify the Shortest Stave in Attention: Enhancing Context Awareness of Large Language Models for Effective Tool-Use": "In this paper, we demonstrate that an inherent waveform pattern in the attention allocation of large language models (LLMs) significantly affects their performance in tasks demanding a high degree of context awareness, such as utilizing LLMs for tool-use. Specifically, the crucial information in the context will be potentially overlooked by model when it is positioned in the trough zone of the attention waveform, leading to decreased performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel inference method named Attention Buckets. It allows LLMs to process their input through multiple parallel processes. Each process utilizes a distinct base angle for the rotary position embedding, thereby creating a unique attention waveform. By compensating an attention trough of a particular process with an attention peak of another process, our approach enhances LLM's awareness to various contextual positions, thus mitigating their risk of overlooking crucial information. In the largest tool-use benchmark, our method elevates a 7B model to achieve state-of-the-art performance comparable to that of GPT-4. On other benchmarks and some RAG tasks, which also demand a thorough understanding of contextual content, Attention Buckets also exhibited notable enhancements in performance.",
    "Forward-Backward Reasoning in Large Language Models for Mathematical Verification": "Self-Consistency samples diverse reasoning chains with answers and chooses the final answer by majority voting. It is based on forward reasoning and cannot further improve performance by sampling more reasoning chains when saturated. To further boost performance, we introduce backward reasoning to verify candidate answers. Specifically, for mathematical tasks, we mask a number in the question and ask the LLM to answer a backward question created by a simple template, i.e., to predict the masked number when a candidate answer is provided. Instead of using forward or backward reasoning alone, we propose FOBAR to combine FOrward and BAckward Reasoning for verification. Extensive experiments on six standard mathematical data sets and three LLMs show that FOBAR achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, FOBAR outperforms Self-Consistency, which uses forward reasoning alone, demonstrating that combining forward and backward reasoning is more accurate in verification. In addition, FOBAR achieves higher accuracy than existing verification methods, showing the effectiveness of the simple template used in backward reasoning and the proposed combination.",
    "Foundation Model for Biomedical Graphs: Integrating Knowledge Graphs and Protein Structures to Large Language Models": "Transformer model has been a de-facto standard in natural language processing. Its adaptations in other fields such as computer vision showed promising results that this architecture is a powerful neural network in representation learning regardless of the data type. This recent success has led to research in multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), which enabled us to new types of tasks and applications with multiple data types. However, multimodal LLM in the biomedical domain is primarily limited to images, text, and/or sequence data. Here I propose to work on multimodal LLM architecture for biomedical graphs such as protein structure and chemical molecules. The research hypothesis is based on the fact that clinicians and researchers in computational biology and clinical research take advantage of various information for their decision-making process. Therefore, an AI model being able to handle multiple data types should boost its ability to use diverse knowledge for improved performances in clinical applications.",
    "FragRel: Exploiting Fragment-level Relations in the External Memory of Large Language Models": "To process contexts with unlimited length using Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies explore hierarchically managing the long text. Only several text fragments are taken from the external memory and passed into the temporary working memory, i.e., LLM's context window. However, existing approaches isolatedly handle the text fragments without considering their structural connections, thereby suffering limited capability on texts with intensive inter-relations, e.g., coherent stories and code repositories. This work attempts to resolve this by exploiting the fragment-level relations in external memory. First, we formulate the fragment-level relations and present several instantiations for different text types. Next, we introduce a relation-aware fragment assessment criteria upon previous independent fragment assessment. Finally, we present the fragment-connected Hierarchical Memory based LLM. We validate the benefits of involving these relations on long story understanding, repository-level code generation, and long-term chatting.",
    "Fraunhofer SIT at WASSA 2024 Empathy and Personality Shared Task: Use of Sentiment Transformers and Data Augmentation With Fuzzy Labels to Predict Emotional Reactions in Conversations and Essays": "Predicting emotions and emotional reactions during conversations and within texts poses challenges, even for advanced AI systems. The second iteration of the WASSA Empathy and Personality Shared Task focuses on creating innovative models that can anticipate emotional responses to news articles containing harmful content across four tasks. In this paper, we introduce our Fraunhofer SIT team's solutions for the three tasks: Task 1 (CONVD), Task 2 (CONVT), and Task 3 (EMP). It involves combining LLM-driven data augmentation with fuzzy labels and fine-tuning RoBERTa models pre-trained on sentiment classification tasks to solve the regression problems. In the competition, our solutions achieved 1st place in Track 1 (CONV-dialog), 8th in Track 2 (CONV-turn), and 3rd place in Track 3 (EMP).",
    "FreeCtrl: Constructing Control Centers with Feedforward Layers for Learning-Free Controllable Text Generation": "Controllable text generation (CTG) seeks to craft texts adhering to specific attributes, traditionally employing learning-based techniques such as training, fine-tuning, or prefix-tuning with attribute-specific datasets. These approaches, while effective, demand extensive computational and data resources. In contrast, some proposed learning-free alternatives circumvent learning but often yield inferior results, exemplifying the fundamental machine learning trade-off between computational expense and model efficacy. To overcome these limitations, we propose FreeCtrl, a learning-free approach that dynamically adjusts the weights of selected feedforward neural network (FFN) vectors to steer the outputs of large language models (LLMs). FreeCtrl hinges on the principle that the weights of different FFN vectors influence the likelihood of different tokens appearing in the output. By identifying and adaptively adjusting the weights of attribute-related FFN vectors, FreeCtrl can control the output likelihood of attribute keywords in the generated content. Extensive experiments on single- and multi-attribute control reveal that the learning-free FreeCtrl outperforms other learning-free and learning-based methods, successfully resolving the dilemma between learning costs and model performance.",
    "FRESHLLMS: Refreshing Large Language Models with Search Engine Augmentation": "Since most large language models (LLMS) are trained once and never updated, they struggle to dynamically adapt to our ever-changing world. In this work, we present FRESHQA, a dynamic QA benchmark that tests a model's ability to answer questions that may require reasoning over up-to-date world knowledge. We develop a two-mode human evaluation procedure to measure both correctness and hallucination, which we use to benchmark both closed and open-source LLMS by collecting >50K human judgments. We observe that all LLMS struggle to answer questions that require fast-changing world knowledge as well as questions with false premises that need to be debunked.  In response, we develop FRESHPROMPT, a few-shot prompting method that curates and organizes relevant information from a search engine into an LLM's prompt. Our experiments show that FRESHPROMPT outperforms both competing search engine-augmented prompting methods such as SELF-ASK (Press et al., 2022) as well as commercial systems such as PERPLEXITY.AI. To facilitate future work, we additionally develop FRESHEVAL, a reliable autorater for quick evaluation and comparison on FRESHQA. Our latest results with FRESHEVAL suggest that open-source LLMS such as MIXTRAL (Jiang et al., 2024), when combined with FRESHPROMPT, are competitive with closed-source and commercial systems on search-augmented QA.",
    "From Discrimination to Generation: Low-Resource Intent Detection with Language Model Instruction Tuning": "Intent detection aims to identify user goals from utterances, and is a ubiquitous step towards the satisfaction of user desired needs in many interaction systems. As dynamic and varied intents arise, models that are capable of identifying new intents promptly are required. However, existing studies usually fine-tune discriminative models on the specific defined intent classes, precluding them from being directly adopted to new intent domains. In this paper, we introduce a generative pre-trained intent model that can recognize new intents from different domains in low-resource scenarios. We reformulate intent detection into a generation task and design descriptive and regularized instructions to guide the model effectively to detect new intents in open domains with no parameter updates. To validate the proposed method, we introduce a new intent detection benchmark, including the Meta-Intent Dataset and three types of representative evaluation settings. We conduct extensive experiments which demonstrate that our method outperforms a range of strong baselines that needs further fine-tuning or domain-specific samples.",
    "From Good to Great: Improving Math Reasoning with Tool-Augmented Interleaf Prompting": "This paper investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Tool-augmented LLMs in tackling complex mathematical reasoning tasks. We introduce IMR-TIP: Improving Math Reasoning with Tool-augmented Interleaf Prompting, a framework that combines the strengths of both LLMs and Tool-augmented LLMs. IMR-TIP follows the “From Good to Great” concept, collecting multiple potential solutions from both LLMs and their Tool-Augmented counterparts for the same math problem, and then selecting or regenerating the most accurate answer after cross-checking these solutions via tool-augmented interleaf prompting. The framework incorporates two key aspects: self-prompt and tool-augmented interleaf prompting (TIP). The former allows LLMs to autonomously refine and improve an initial prompt related to tool usage, while the latter enables LLMs to derive the final answer by dynamically analyzing the problem, cross-checking potential solutions, and revising previous reasoning hints in an interleaved manner. Experimental analysis shows that IMR-TIP achieves enhanced mathematical capabilities and outperforms traditional LLMs and tool-augmented LLMs in accuracy and reasoning diversity on math reasoning tasks. For instance, IMR-TIP can improve Tool-augmented ChatGPT on GSM8K-Hard from 56.0% to 65.2%.",
    "From Model-centered to Human-Centered: Revision Distance as a Metric for Text Evaluation in LLMs-based Applications": "Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is fundamental, particularly in the context of practical applications. Conventional evaluation methods, typically designed primarily for LLM development, yield numerical scores that ignore the user experience. Therefore, our study shifts the focus from model-centered to human-centered evaluation in the context of AI-powered writing assistance applications. Our proposed metric, termed “Revision Distance,” utilizes LLMs to suggest revision edits that mimic the human writing process. It is determined by counting the revision edits generated by LLMs. Benefiting from the generated revision edit details, our metric can provide a self-explained text evaluation result in a human-understandable manner beyond the context-independent score. Our results show that for the easy-writing task, “Revision Distance” is consistent with established metrics (ROUGE, Bert-score, and GPT-score), but offers more insightful, detailed feedback and better distinguishes between texts. Moreover, in the context of challenging academic writing tasks, our metric still delivers reliable evaluations where other metrics tend to struggle. Furthermore, our metric also holds significant potential for scenarios lacking reference texts.",
    "From Moments to Milestones: Incremental Timeline Summarization Leveraging Large Language Models": "Timeline summarization (TLS) is essential for distilling coherent narratives from a vast collection of texts, tracing the progression of events and topics over time. Prior research typically focuses on either event or topic timeline summarization, neglecting the potential synergy of these two forms. In this study, we bridge this gap by introducing a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) for generating both event and topic timelines. Our approach diverges from conventional TLS by prioritizing event detection, leveraging LLMs as pseudo-oracles for incremental event clustering and construction of timelines from a text stream. As a result, it produces a more interpretable pipeline. Empirical evaluation across four TLS benchmarks reveals that our approach outperforms the best prior published approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in timeline summarization for real-world applications.",
    "From Nile Sands to Digital Hands: Machine Translation of Coptic Texts": "The Coptic language, rooted in the historical landscapes of Egypt, continues to serve as a vital liturgical medium for the Coptic Orthodox and Catholic Churches across Egypt, North Sudan, Libya, and the United States, with approximately ten million speakers worldwide. However, the scarcity of digital resources in Coptic has resulted in its exclusion from digital systems, thereby limiting its accessibility and preservation in modern technological contexts. Our research addresses this issue by developing the most extensive parallel Coptic-centered corpus to date. This corpus comprises about 8,000 parallel sentences between Arabic and Coptic, and more than 24,000 parallel sentences between English and Coptic. We have also developed the first neural machine translation system between Coptic, English, and Arabic. Lastly, we evaluate the capability of leading proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate to and from Coptic using a few-shot learning approach (in-context learning). Our code and data are available at https://github.com/UBC-NLP/copticmt.",
    "From One to Many: Expanding the Scope of Toxicity Mitigation in Language Models": "To date, toxicity mitigation in language models has almost entirely been focused on single-language settings. As language models embrace multilingual capabilities, it's crucial our safety measures keep pace. Recognizing this research gap, our approach expands the scope of conventional toxicity mitigation to address the complexities presented by multiple languages. In the absence of sufficient annotated datasets across languages, we employ translated data to evaluate and enhance our mitigation techniques. We also compare finetuning mitigation approaches against retrieval-augmented techniques under both static and continual toxicity mitigation scenarios. This allows us to examine the effects of translation quality and the cross-lingual transfer on toxicity mitigation. We also explore how model size and data quantity affect the success of these mitigation efforts. Covering nine languages, our study represents a broad array of linguistic families and levels of resource availability, ranging from high to mid-resource languages. Through comprehensive experiments, we provide insights into the complexities of multilingual toxicity mitigation, offering valuable insights and paving the way for future research in this increasingly important field.",
    "From Representational Harms to Quality-of-Service Harms: A Case Study on Llama 2 Safety Safeguards": "Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption in various domains. However, these advancements have also introduced additional safety risks and raised concerns regarding their detrimental impact on already marginalized populations. Despite growing mitigation efforts to develop safety safeguards, such as supervised safety-oriented fine-tuning and leveraging safe reinforcement learning from human feedback, multiple concerns regarding the safety and ingrained biases in these models remain. Furthermore, previous work has demonstrated that models optimized for safety often display exaggerated safety behaviors, such as a tendency to refrain from responding to certain requests as a precautionary measure. As such, a clear trade-off between the helpfulness and safety of these models has been documented in the literature. In this paper, we further investigate the effectiveness of safety measures by evaluating models on already mitigated biases. Using the case of Llama 2 as an example, we illustrate how LLMs' safety responses can still encode harmful assumptions. To do so, we create a set of non-toxic prompts, which we then use to evaluate Llama models. Through our new taxonomy of LLMs responses to users, we observe that the safety/helpfulness trade-offs are more pronounced for certain demographic groups which can lead to quality-of-service harms for marginalized populations. Warning: This paper contains offensive and biased examples of model outputs.",
    "From Role-Play to Drama-Interaction: An LLM Solution": "Drama is a form of storytelling inspired by human creativity, proceeding with a predefined storyline, carrying emotions and thoughts. This paper introduces LLM-based interactive drama, which endows traditional drama with an unprecedented immersion, where a person is allowed to walk into it and interact with the characters and scenes. We define this new artistic genre by 6 essential elements—plot, character, thought, diction, spectacle and interaction—and study the entire pipeline to forge a backbone drama LLM to drive the playing process, which is challenged by limited drama resources, uncontrollable narrative development, and complicated instruction following. We propose Narrative Chain to offer finer control over the narrative progression during interaction with players; Auto-Drama to synthesize drama scripts given arbitrary stories; Sparse Instruction Tuning to allow the model to follow sophisticated instructions. We manually craft 3 scripts, Detective Conan, Harry Potter, Romeo and Juliet, and design a 5-dimension principle to evaluate the drama LLM comprehensively.",
    "From Showgirls to Performers: Fine-tuning with Gender-inclusive Language for Bias Reduction in LLMs": "Gender bias is not only prevalent in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their training data, but also firmly ingrained into the structural aspects of language itself. Therefore, adapting linguistic structures within LLM training data to promote gender-inclusivity can make gender representations within the model more inclusive. The focus of our work are gender-exclusive affixes in English, such as in showgirl or man-cave, which can perpetuate gender stereotypes and binary conceptions of gender. We use an LLM training dataset to compile a catalogue of 692 gender-exclusive terms along with gender-neutral variants and from this, develop a gender-inclusive fine-tuning dataset, the Tiny Heap. Fine-tuning three different LLMs with this dataset, we observe an overall reduction in gender-stereotyping tendencies across the models. Our approach provides a practical method for enhancing gender inclusivity in LLM training data and contributes to incorporating queer-feminist linguistic activism in bias mitigation research in NLP.",
    "From Tarzan to Tolkien: Controlling the Language Proficiency Level of LLMs for Content Generation": "We study the problem of controlling the difficulty level of text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) for contexts where end-users are not fully proficient, such as language learners. Using a novel framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of several key approaches for this task, including few-shot prompting, supervised finetuning, and reinforcement learning (RL), utilising both GPT-4 and open source alternatives like LLama2-7B and Mistral-7B. Our findings reveal a large performance gap between GPT-4 and the open source models when using prompt-based strategies. However, we show how to bridge this gap with a careful combination of finetuning and RL alignment. Our best model, CALM (CEFR-Aligned Language Model), surpasses the performance of GPT-4 and other strategies, at only a fraction of the cost. We further validate the quality of our results through a small-scale human study.",
    "Full Parameter Fine-tuning for Large Language Models with Limited Resources": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but demand massive GPU resources for training. Lowering the threshold for LLMs training would encourage greater participation from researchers, benefiting both academia and society. While existing approaches have focused on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, which tunes or adds a small number of parameters, few have addressed the challenge of tuning the full parameters of LLMs with limited resources. In this work, we propose a new optimizer, LOw-Memory Optimization (LOMO), which fuses the gradient computation and the parameter update in one step to reduce memory usage. By integrating LOMO with existing memory saving techniques, we reduce memory usage to 10.8% compared to the standard approach (DeepSpeed solution). Consequently, our approach enables the full parameter fine-tuning of a 65B model on a single machine with 8×RTX 3090, each with 24GB memory.",
    "Functional Overlap Reranking for Neural Code Generation": "Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) have ushered in a new era in code generation advancements. However, selecting the best code solutions from all possible CodeLLM outputs remains a challenge. Previous methods often overlooked the intricate functional similarities and interactions between solution clusters. We introduce SRank, a novel reranking strategy for selecting the best solutions from code generation, focusing on modeling the relationships between clusters of solutions. By quantifying the functional overlap between solution clusters, our approach provides a better ranking strategy for code solutions. Empirical results show that our method achieves remarkable results on the pass@1 score. For instance, on the Human-Eval benchmark, we achieve 69.66% in pass@1 with Codex002, 75.31% with WizardCoder, 53.99% with StarCoder, and 60.55% with CodeGen, surpassing state-of-the-art code generation reranking methods such as CodeT and Coder-Reviewer on the same CodeLLM by a significant margin (≈6.1% improvement on average). Even in scenarios with a limited number of sampled solutions and test cases, our approach demonstrates robustness and superiority, marking a new benchmark in code generation reranking.",
    "Fundamental Capabilities of Large Language Models and their Applications in Domain Scenarios: A Survey": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant value in domain-specific applications, benefiting from their fundamental capabilities. Nevertheless, it is still unclear which fundamental capabilities contribute to success in specific domains. Moreover, the existing benchmark-based evaluation cannot effectively reflect the performance of real-world applications. In this survey, we review recent advances of LLMs in domain applications, aiming to summarize the fundamental capabilities and their collaboration. Furthermore, we establish connections between fundamental capabilities and specific domains, evaluating the varying importance of different capabilities. Based on our findings, we propose a reliable strategy for domains to choose more robust backbone LLMs for real-world applications.",
    "G-DIG: Towards Gradient-based DIverse and hiGh-quality Instruction Data Selection for Machine Translation": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in general scenarios. Instruction finetuning empowers them to align with humans in various tasks. Nevertheless, the Diversity and Quality of the instruction data remain two main challenges for instruction finetuning. With regard to this, in this paper, we propose a novel gradient-based method to automatically select high-quality and diverse instruction finetuning data for machine translation. Our key innovation centers around analyzing how individual training examples influence the model during training. Specifically, we select training examples that exert beneficial influences on the model as high-quality ones by means of Influence Function plus a small high-quality seed dataset. Moreover, to enhance the diversity of the training data we maximize the variety of influences they have on the model by clustering on their gradients and resampling. Extensive experiments on WMT22 and FLORES translation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our methods, and in-depth analysis further validates their effectiveness and generalization.",
    "GAOKAO-MM: A Chinese Human-Level Benchmark for Multimodal Models Evaluation": "The Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated great abilities in image perception and language understanding. However, existing datasets either focus solely on primary perception abilities and commonsense knowledge, or have a low level of text comprehension difficulty, which are insufficient to reflect the comprehensive capabilities of LVLMs, particularly in terms of Chinese language proficiency. We propose GAOKAO-MM, a multi-modal benchmark based on the Chinese College Entrance Examination (GAOKAO), comprising of 8 subjects and 12 types of images, such as diagrams, function graphs, maps and photos. GAOKAO-MM derives from native Chinese context and sets human-level requirements for the model's abilities, including perception, understanding, knowledge and reasoning. We evaluate 10 LVLMs and find that the accuracies of all of them are lower than 50%, with GPT-4-Vision (48.1%), Qwen-VL-Plus (41.2%) and Gemini-Pro-Vision (35.1%) ranking in the top three positions. The results of our multi-dimension analysis indicate that LVLMs have moderate distance towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and provide insights facilitating the development of multi-lingual LVLMs.",
    "GATE X-E : A Challenge Set for Gender-Fair Translations from Weakly-Gendered Languages": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) continues to improve in quality and adoption, yet the inadvertent perpetuation of gender bias remains a significant concern. Despite numerous studies on gender bias in translations into English from weakly gendered-languages, there are no benchmarks for evaluating this phenomenon or for assessing mitigation strategies. To address this gap, we introduce GATE X-E, an extension to the GATE (Rarrick et al., 2023) corpus, that consists of human translations from Turkish, Hungarian, Finnish, and Persian into English. Each translation is accompanied by feminine, masculine, and neutral variants. The dataset, which contains between 1250 and 1850 instances for each of the four language pairs, features natural sentences with a wide range of sentence lengths and domains, challenging translation rewriters on various linguistic phenomena. Additionally, we present a translation gender rewriting solution built with GPT-4 and use GATE X-E to evaluate it. We open source our contributions to encourage further research on gender debiasing.",
    "Generalization or Memorization: Data Contamination and Trustworthy Evaluation for Large Language Models": "Recent statements about the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are usually supported by evaluating on open-access benchmarks. Considering the vast size and wide-ranging sources of LLMs' training data, it could explicitly or implicitly include test data, leading to LLMs being more susceptible to data contamination. However, due to the opacity of training data, the black-box access of models, and the rapid growth of synthetic training data, detecting and mitigating data contamination for LLMs faces significant challenges. In this paper, we propose CDD, which stands for Contamination Detection via output Distribution for LLMs. CDD necessitates only the sampled texts to detect data contamination, by identifying the peakedness of LLM's output distribution. To mitigate the impact of data contamination in evaluation, we also present TED: Trustworthy Evaluation via output Distribution, based on the correction of LLM's output distribution. To facilitate this study, we introduce two benchmarks, i.e., DET-CON and COMIEVAL, for data contamination detection and contamination mitigation evaluation tasks. Extensive experimental results show that CDD achieves the average relative improvements of 21.8%-30.2% over other contamination detection approaches in terms of Accuracy, F1 Score, and AUC metrics, and can effectively detect implicit contamination. TED substantially mitigates performance improvements up to 66.9% attributed to data contamination across various contamination setups. In real-world applications, we reveal that ChatGPT exhibits a high potential to suffer from data contamination on HumanEval benchmark.",
    "Generalization-Enhanced Code Vulnerability Detection via Multi-Task Instruction Fine-Tuning": "Code Pre-trained Models (CodePTMs) based vulnerability detection have achieved promising results over recent years. However, these models struggle to generalize as they typically learn superficial mapping from source code to labels instead of understanding the root causes of code vulnerabilities, resulting in poor performance in real-world scenarios beyond the training instances. To tackle this challenge, we introduce VulLLM, a novel framework that integrates multi-task learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively mine deep-seated vulnerability features. Specifically, we construct two auxiliary tasks beyond the vulnerability detection task. First, we utilize the vulnerability patches to construct a vulnerability localization task. Second, based on the vulnerability features extracted from patches, we leverage GPT-4 to construct a vulnerability interpretation task. VulLLM innovatively augments vulnerability classification by leveraging generative LLMs to understand complex vulnerability patterns, thus compelling the model to capture the root causes of vulnerabilities rather than overfitting to spurious features of a single task. The experiments conducted on six large datasets demonstrate that VulLLM surpasses seven state-of-the-art models in terms of effectiveness, generalization, and robustness.",
    "Generalized Category Discovery with Large Language Models in the Loop": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is a crucial task that aims to recognize both known and novel categories from a set of unlabeled data by utilizing a few labeled data with only known categories. Due to the lack of supervision and category information, current methods usually perform poorly on novel categories and struggle to reveal semantic meanings of the discovered clusters, which limits their applications in the real world. To mitigate the above issues, we propose Loop, an end-to-end active-learning framework that introduces Large Language Models (LLMs) into the training loop, which can boost model performance and generate category names without relying on any human efforts. Specifically, we first propose Local Inconsistent Sampling (LIS) to select samples that have a higher probability of falling to wrong clusters, based on neighborhood prediction consistency and entropy of cluster assignment probabilities. Then we propose a Scalable Query strategy to allow LLMs to choose true neighbors of the selected samples from multiple candidate samples. Based on the feedback from LLMs, we perform Refined Neighborhood Contrastive Learning (RNCL) to pull samples and their neighbors closer to learn clustering-friendly representations. Finally, we select representative samples from clusters corresponding to novel categories to allow LLMs to generate category names for them. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that Loop outperforms SOTA models by a large margin and generates accurate category names for the discovered clusters. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Lackel/LOOP.",
    "Generalizing Conversational Dense Retrieval via LLM-Cognition Data Augmentation": "Conversational search utilizes multi-turn natural language contexts to retrieve relevant passages. Existing conversational dense retrieval models mostly view a conversation as a fixed sequence of questions and responses, overlooking the severe data sparsity problem - that is, users can perform a conversation in various ways. Consequently, they often struggle to generalize to diverse conversations in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a framework for generalizing Conversational dense retrieval via LLM-cognition data Augmentation (CONVAUG). We first generate multi-level augmented conversations to capture the diverse nature of conversational contexts. Inspired by human cognition, we devise a cognition-aware prompting process to mitigate the generation of false positives, false negatives, and hallucinations. Moreover, we develop a difficulty-adaptive sample filter that selects challenging samples for complex conversations, thereby giving the model a larger learning space. A contrastive learning objective is then employed to train a better conversational context encoder. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets, under both normal and zero-shot settings, demonstrate the effectiveness, generalizability, and applicability of CONVAUG.",
    "Generate-then-Ground in Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Multi-hop Question Answering": "Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) tasks present a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the intensive knowledge required. Current solutions, like Retrieval-Augmented Generation, typically retrieve potential documents from an external corpus to read an answer. However, the performance of this retrieve-then-read paradigm is constrained by the retriever and the inevitable noise in the retrieved documents. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a novel generate-then-ground (GenGround) framework, synergizing the parametric knowledge of LLMs and external documents to solve a multi-hop question. GenGround empowers LLMs to alternate two phases until the final answer is derived: (1) formulate a simpler, single-hop question and directly generate the answer; (2) ground the question-answer pair in retrieved documents, amending any wrong predictions in the answer. We also propose an instructional grounding distillation method to generalize our method into smaller models. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets illustrate the superiority of our method.",
    "Generating Coherent Sequences of Visual Illustrations for Real-World Manual Tasks": "Multistep instructions, such as recipes and how-to guides, greatly benefit from visual aids, such as a series of images that accompany the instruction steps. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become adept at generating coherent textual steps, Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) are less capable of generating accompanying image sequences. The most challenging aspect is that each generated image needs to adhere to the relevant textual step instruction, as well as be visually consistent with earlier images in the sequence. To address this problem, we propose an approach for generating consistent image sequences, which integrates a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with an LLM to transform the sequence into a caption to maintain the semantic coherence of the sequence. In addition, to maintain the visual coherence of the image sequence, we introduce a copy mechanism to initialise reverse diffusion processes with a latent vector iteration from a previously generated image from a relevant step. Both strategies will condition the reverse diffusion process on the sequence of instruction steps and tie the contents of the current image to previous instruction steps and corresponding images. Experiments show that the proposed approach is preferred by humans in 46.6% of the cases against 26.6% for the second best method. In addition, automatic metrics showed that the proposed method maintains semantic coherence and visual consistency across the sequence of visual illustrations.",
    "Generating Diverse and High-Quality Texts by Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding": "One of the most important challenges in text generation systems is to produce outputs that are not only correct but also diverse. Recently, Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) decoding has gained prominence for generating sentences of the highest quality among the decoding algorithms. However, existing algorithms proposed to generate diverse outputs are predominantly based on beam search or random sampling, thus their output quality is capped by these underlying decoding algorithms. In this paper, we investigate an alternative approach - we develop diversity-promoting decoding algorithms by enforcing diversity objectives to MBR decoding. We propose two variants of MBR; (i) Diverse MBR (DMBR) that adds a diversity penalty to the decoding objective and (ii) k-medoids MBR (KMBR) that reformulates the decoding task as a clustering problem. We evaluate DMBR and KMBR on a variety of directed text generation tasks using encoder-decoder models and a language model with prompting. The experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve a better trade-off than the diverse beam search and sampling algorithms overall. Our code is available at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/diverse-mbr/.",
    "Generating Harder Cross-document Event Coreference Resolution Datasets using Metaphoric Paraphrasing": "The most widely used Cross-Document Event Coreference Resolution (CDEC) datasets fail to convey the true difficulty of the task, due to the lack of lexical diversity between coreferring event triggers (words or phrases that refer to an event). Furthermore, there is a dearth of event datasets for figurative language, limiting a crucial avenue of research in event comprehension. We address these two issues by introducing ECB+META, a lexically rich variant of Event Coref Bank Plus (ECB+) for CDEC on figurative and metaphoric language. We use GPT-4 as a tool for the metaphoric transformation of sentences in the documents of ECB+, then tag the original event triggers in the transformed sentences in a semi-automated manner. In this way, we avoid the re-annotation of expensive coreference links. We present results that show existing methods that work well on ECB+ struggle with ECB+META, thereby paving the way for CDEC research on a much more challenging dataset.",
    "Generation and De-Identification of Indian Clinical Discharge Summaries using LLMs": "The consequences of a healthcare data breach can be devastating for the patients, providers, and payers. The average financial impact of a data breach in recent months has been estimated to be close to USD 10 million. This is especially significant for healthcare organizations in India that are managing rapid digitization while still establishing data governance procedures that align with the letter and spirit of the law. Computer-based systems for de-identification of personal information are vulnerable to data drift, often rendering them ineffective in cross-institution settings. Therefore, a rigorous assessment of existing de-identification against local health datasets is imperative to support the safe adoption of digital health initiatives in India. Using a small set of de-identified patient discharge summaries provided by an Indian healthcare institution, in this paper, we report the nominal performance of de-identification algorithms (based on language models) trained on publicly available non-Indian datasets, pointing towards a lack of cross-institutional generalization. Similarly, experimentation with off-the-shelf de-identification systems reveals potential risks associated with the approach. To overcome data scarcity, we explore generating synthetic clinical reports (using publicly available and Indian summaries) by performing in-context learning over Large Language Models (LLMs). Our experiments demonstrate the use of generated reports as an effective strategy for creating high-performing de-identification systems with good generalization capabilities.",
    "Generation and Evaluation of Synthetic Endoscopy Free-Text Reports with Differential Privacy": "The development of NLP models in the healthcare sector faces important challenges due to the limited availability of patient data, mainly driven by privacy concerns. This study proposes the generation of synthetic free-text medical reports, specifically focusing on the gastroenterology domain, to address the scarcity of specialised datasets, while preserving patient privacy. We fine-tune BioGPT on over 90,000 endoscopy reports and integrate Differential Privacy (DP) into the training process. 10,000 DP-private synthetic reports are generated by this model. The generated synthetic data is evaluated across multiple dimensions: similarity to real datasets, language quality, and utility in both supervised and semi-supervised NLP tasks. Results suggest that while DP integration impacts text quality, it offers a promising balance between data utility and privacy, improving the performance of a real-world downstream task. Our study underscores the potential of synthetic data to facilitate model development in the healthcare domain without compromising patient privacy.",
    "Generation Meets Verification: Accelerating Large Language Model Inference with Smart Parallel Auto-Correct Decoding": "This research aims to accelerate the inference speed of large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. We propose Smart Parallel Auto-Correct dEcoding (SPACE), an approach designed for achieving lossless acceleration of LLMs. By integrating semi-autoregressive inference and speculative decoding capabilities, SPACE uniquely enables autoregressive LLMs to parallelize token generation and verification. This is realized through a specialized semi-autoregressive supervised fine-tuning process that equips existing LLMs with the ability to simultaneously predict multiple tokens. Additionally, an auto-correct decoding algorithm facilitates the simultaneous generation and verification of token sequences within a single model invocation. Through extensive experiments on a range of LLMs, SPACE has demonstrated inference speedup ranging from 2.7x-4.0x on HumanEval-X while maintaining output quality.",
    "Generative Cross-Modal Retrieval: Memorizing Images in Multimodal Language Models for Retrieval and Beyond": "The recent advancements in generative language models have demonstrated their ability to memorize knowledge from documents and recall knowledge to respond to user queries effectively. Building upon this capability, we propose to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to memorize and recall images within their parameters. Given a user query for visual content, the MLLM is anticipated to “recall” the relevant image from its parameters as the response. Achieving this target presents notable challenges, including inbuilt visual memory and visual recall schemes within MLLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce a generative cross-modal retrieval framework, which assigns unique identifier strings to represent images and involves two training steps: learning to memorize and learning to retrieve. The first step focuses on training the MLLM to memorize the association between images and their respective identifiers. The latter step teaches the MLLM to generate the corresponding identifier of the target image, given the textual query input. By memorizing images in MLLMs, we introduce a new paradigm to cross-modal retrieval, distinct from previous discriminative approaches. The experiments demonstrate that the generative paradigm performs effectively and efficiently even with large-scale image candidate sets. The code is released at https://github.com/liyongqi67/GRACE.",
    "Generative Debunking of Climate Misinformation": "Misinformation about climate change causes numerous negative impacts, necessitating corrective responses. Psychological research has offered various strategies for reducing the influence of climate misinformation, such as the fact-myth-fallacy-fact-structure. However, practically implementing corrective interventions at scale represents a challenge. Automatic detection and correction of misinformation offers a solution to the misinformation problem. This study documents the development of large language models that accept as input a climate myth and produce a debunking that adheres to the fact-myth-fallacy-fact (“truth sandwich”) structure, by incorporating contrarian claim classification and fallacy detection into an LLM prompting framework. We combine open (Mixtral, Palm2) and proprietary (GPT-4) LLMs with prompting strategies of varying complexity. Experiments reveal promising performance of GPT-4 and Mixtral if combined with structured prompts. We identify specific challenges of debunking generation and human evaluation, and map out avenues for future work. We release a dataset of high-quality truth-sandwich debunkings, source code, and a demo of the debunking system.",
    "Generative Evaluation of Non-Literal Intent Resolution in LLMs": "Humans often express their communicative intents indirectly or non-literally, which requires their interlocutors—human or AI—to understand beyond the literal meaning of words. While most existing work has focused on discriminative evaluations, we present a new approach to generatively evaluate large language models' (LLMs') intention understanding by examining their responses to non-literal utterances. Ideally, an LLM should respond in line with the true intention of a non-literal utterance, not its literal interpretation. Our findings show that LLMs struggle to generate pragmatically relevant responses to non-literal language, achieving only 50-55% accuracy on average. While explicitly providing oracle intentions significantly improves performance (e.g., 75% for Mistral-Instruct), this still indicates challenges in leveraging given intentions to produce appropriate responses. Using chain-of-thought to make models spell out intentions yields much smaller gains (60% for Mistral-Instruct). These findings suggest that LLMs are not yet effective pragmatic interlocutors, highlighting the need for better approaches for modeling intentions and utilizing them for pragmatic generation.",
    "Generative Explore-Exploit: Training-free Optimization of Generative Recommender Systems using LLM Optimizers": "Recommender systems are widely used to suggest engaging content, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have given rise to generative recommenders. Such systems can directly generate items, including for open-set tasks like question suggestion. While the world knowledge of LLMs enable good recommendations, improving the generated content through user feedback is challenging as continuously fine-tuning LLMs is prohibitively expensive. We present a training-free approach for optimizing generative recommenders by connecting user feedback loops to LLM-based optimizers. We propose a generative explore-exploit method that can not only exploit generated items with known high engagement, but also actively explore and discover hidden population preferences to improve recommendation quality. We evaluate our approach on question generation in two domains (e-commerce and general knowledge), and model user feedback with Click Through Rate (CTR). Experiments show our LLM-based explore-exploit approach can iteratively improve recommendations, and consistently increase CTR. Ablation analysis shows that generative exploration is key to learning user preferences, avoiding the pitfalls of greedy exploit-only approaches. A human evaluation strongly supports our quantitative findings.",
    "Generative Input: Towards Next-Generation Input Methods Paradigm": "Since the release of ChatGPT, generative models have achieved tremendous success and become the de facto approach for various NLP tasks. However, its application in the field of input methods remains under-explored. Many neural network approaches have been applied to the construction of Chinese input method engines (IMEs). Previous research often assumed that the input pinyin was correct and focused on Pinyin-to-character (P2C) task, which significantly falls short of meeting users' demands. Moreover, previous research could not leverage user feedback to optimize the model and provide personalized results. In this study, we propose a novel Generative Input paradigm named GeneInput. It uses prompts to handle all input scenarios and other intelligent auxiliary input functions, optimizing the model with user feedback. The results demonstrate that we have achieved state-of-the-art performance for the first time in the Full-mode Key-sequence to Characters task. GeneInput also includes RLHF-IME, a novel RLHF application framework for input method, that eliminates the need for manual ranking annotations and the performance surpasses GPT-4. Relevant resources have been open-sourced.",
    "Generative Multi-Modal Entity Linking with Knowledge Retriever": "Multi-modal entity linking (MEL) is a challenging task that requires accurate prediction of entities within extensive search spaces, utilizing multi-modal contexts. Existing generative approaches struggle with the knowledge gap between visual entity information and the intrinsic parametric knowledge of LLMs. To address this knowledge gap, we introduce a novel approach called GELR, which incorporates a knowledge retriever to enhance visual entity information by leveraging external sources. Additionally, we devise a prioritization scheme that effectively handles noisy retrieval results and manages conflicts arising from the integration of external and internal knowledge. Moreover, we propose a noise-aware instruction tuning technique during training to finely adjust the model's ability to leverage retrieved information effectively. Through extensive experiments conducted on three benchmarks, our approach showcases remarkable improvements, ranging from 2.0% to 6.5%, across all evaluation metrics compared to strong baselines. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method in tackling the complexities of multi-modal entity linking.",
    "Generative Pretrained Structured Transformers: Unsupervised Syntactic Language Models at Scale": "A syntactic language model (SLM) incrementally generates a sentence with its syntactic tree in a left-to-right manner. We present Generative Pretrained Structured Transformers (GPST), an unsupervised SLM at scale capable of being pre-trained from scratch on raw texts with high parallelism. GPST circumvents the limitations of previous SLMs such as relying on gold trees and sequential training. It consists of two components, a usual SLM supervised by a uni-directional language modeling loss, and an additional composition model, which induces syntactic parse trees and computes constituent representations, supervised by a bi-directional language modeling loss. We propose a representation surrogate to enable joint parallel training of the two models in a hard-EM fashion. We pre-train GPST on OpenWebText, a corpus with 9 billion tokens, and demonstrate the superiority of GPST over GPT-2 with a comparable size in numerous tasks covering both language understanding and language generation. Meanwhile, GPST also significantly outperforms existing unsupervised SLMs on left-to-right grammar induction, while holding a substantial acceleration on training.",
    "GenTranslate: Large Language Models are Generative Multilingual Speech and Machine Translators": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have stepped forward the development of multilingual speech and machine translation by its reduced representation errors and incorporated external knowledge. However, both translation tasks typically utilize beam search decoding and top-1 hypothesis selection for inference. These techniques struggle to fully exploit the rich information in the diverse N-best hypotheses, making them less optimal for translation tasks that require a single, high-quality output sequence. In this paper, we propose a new generative paradigm for translation tasks, namely “GenTranslate”, which builds upon LLMs to generate better results from the diverse translation versions in N-best list. Leveraging the rich linguistic knowledge and strong reasoning abilities of LLMs, our new paradigm can integrate the rich information in N-best candidates to generate a higher-quality translation result. Furthermore, to support LLM finetuning, we build and release a HypoTranslate dataset that contains over 592K hypotheses-translation pairs in 11 languages. Experiments on various speech and machine translation benchmarks (e.g., FLEURS, CoVoST-2, WMT) demonstrate that our GenTranslate significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art model.",
    "GeoAgent: To Empower LLMs using Geospatial Tools for Address Standardization": "This paper presents a novel solution to tackle the challenges posed by the abundance of non-standard addresses, which are input by users in modern applications such as navigation maps, ride-hailing apps, food delivery platforms, and logistics services. These manually entered addresses often contain irregularities, such as missing information, spelling errors, colloquial descriptions, and directional offsets, which hinder address-related tasks like address matching and linking. To tackle these challenges, we propose GeoAgent, a new framework comprising two main components: a large language model (LLM) and a suite of geographical tools. By harnessing the semantic understanding capabilities of the LLM and integrating specific geospatial tools, GeoAgent incorporates spatial knowledge into address texts and achieves efficient address standardization. Further, to verify the effectiveness and practicality of our approach, we construct a comprehensive dataset of complex non-standard addresses, which fills the gaps in existing datasets and proves invaluable for training and evaluating the performance of address standardization models in this community. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of GeoAgent, showcasing substantial improvements in the performance of address-related models across various downstream tasks.",
    "GeoEval: Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs and Multi-Modal Models on Geometry Problem-Solving": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal models (MMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capabilities in problem-solving. Yet, their proficiency in tackling geometry math problems, which necessitates an integrated understanding of both textual and visual information, has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this gap, we introduce the GeoEval benchmark, a comprehensive collection that includes a main subset of 2,000 problems, a 750 problems subset focusing on backward reasoning, an augmented subset of 2,000 problems, and a hard subset of 300 problems. This benchmark facilitates a deeper investigation into the performance of LLMs and MMs in solving geometry math problems. Our evaluation of ten LLMs and MMs across these varied subsets reveals that the Wizard-Math model excels, achieving a 55.67% accuracy rate on the main subset but only a 6.00% accuracy on the hard subset. This highlights the critical need for testing models against datasets on which they have not been pre-trained. Additionally, our findings indicate that GPT-series models perform more effectively on problems they have rephrased, suggesting a promising method for enhancing model capabilities.",
    "Get the Best out of 1B LLMs: Insights from Information Extraction on Clinical Documents": "While the popularity of large, versatile language models like ChatGPT continues to rise, the landscape shifts when considering open-source models tailored to specific domains. Moreover, many areas, such as clinical documents, suffer from a scarcity of training data, often amounting to only a few hundred instances. Additionally, in certain settings, such as hospitals, cloud-based solutions pose privacy concerns, necessitating the deployment of language models on traditional hardware, such as single GPUs or powerful CPUs. To address these complexities, we conduct extensive experiments on both clinical entity detection and relation extraction in clinical documents using 1B parameter models. Our study delves into traditional fine-tuning, continuous pre-training in the medical domain, and instruction-tuning methods, providing valuable insights into their effectiveness in a multilingual setting. Our results underscore the importance of domain-specific models and pre-training for clinical natural language processing tasks. Furthermore, data augmentation using cross-lingual information improves performance in most cases, highlighting the potential for multilingual enhancements.",
    "Getting Serious about Humor: Crafting Humor Datasets with Unfunny Large Language Models": "Humor is a fundamental facet of human cognition and interaction. Yet, despite recent advances in natural language processing, humor detection remains a challenging task that is complicated by the scarcity of datasets that pair humorous texts with similar non-humorous counterparts. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can generate synthetic data for humor detection via editing texts. We benchmark LLMs on an existing human dataset and show that current LLMs display an impressive ability to “unfun” jokes, as judged by humans and as measured on the downstream task of humor detection. We extend our approach to a code-mixed English-Hindi humor dataset where we find that GPT-4's synthetic data is highly rated by bilingual annotators and provides challenging adversarial examples for humor classifiers.",
    "GKT: A Novel Guidance-Based Knowledge Transfer Framework For Efficient Cloud-edge Collaboration LLM Deployment": "The burgeoning size of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to enhanced capabilities in generating responses, albeit at the expense of increased inference times and elevated resource demands. Existing methods of acceleration, predominantly hinged on knowledge distillation, generally necessitate fine-tuning of considerably large models, posing a challenge for average users. Furthermore, present techniques for expediting inference and reducing costs operate independently. To address these issues, we introduce a novel and intuitive Guidance-based Knowledge Transfer (GKT) framework. This approach leverages a larger LLM as a “teacher” to create guidance prompts, paired with a smaller “student” model to finalize responses. Remarkably, GKT requires no fine-tuning and doesn't necessitate the teacher and student models to have the same vocabulary, allowing for extensive batch generation to accelerate the process while ensuring user customization. GKT can be seamlessly integrated into cloud-edge collaboration architectures, and is versatile enough for plug-and-play application across various models. When utilizing ChatGPT as teacher model and Llama2-70B as the student model, we can achieve 95.00% of ChatGPT's performance at 52% of the cost. The results highlight substantial enhancements in accuracy and processing speed on the GSM8K and CSQA datasets, surpassing the performance of using either the student or teacher models in isolation.",
    "Gla-AI4BioMed at RRG24: Visual Instruction-tuned Adaptation for Radiology Report Generation": "We introduce a radiology-focused visual language model designed to generate radiology reports from chest X-rays. Building on previous findings that large language models (LLMs) can acquire multimodal capabilities when aligned with pretrained vision encoders, we demonstrate similar potential with chest X-ray images. This integration enhances the ability of the model to understand and describe chest X-ray images. Our model combines an image encoder with a fine-tuned LLM based on the Vicuna-7B architecture, enabling it to generate different sections of a radiology report with notable accuracy. The training process involves a two-stage approach: (i) initial alignment of chest X-ray features with the LLM (ii) followed by fine-tuning for radiology report generation.",
    "GNNAVI: Navigating the Information Flow in Large Language Models by Graph Neural Network": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities when prompts with demonstrations are used. However, fine-tuning still remains crucial to further enhance their adaptability. Prompt-based fine-tuning proves to be an effective fine-tuning method in low-data scenarios, but high demands on computing resources limit its practicality. We address this issue by introducing a prompt-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach. GNNAVI leverages insights into ICL's information flow dynamics, which indicates that label words act in prompts as anchors for information propagation. GNNAVI employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) layer to precisely guide the aggregation and distribution of information flow during the processing of prompts by hardwiring the desired information flow into the GNN. Our experiments on text classification tasks with GPT-2 and Llama2 show GNNAVI surpasses standard prompt-based fine-tuning methods in few-shot settings by updating just 0.2% to 0.5% of parameters. We compare GNNAVI with prevalent PEFT approaches, such as prefix tuning, LoRA and Adapter in terms of performance and efficiency. Our analysis reveals that GNNAVI enhances information flow and ensures a clear aggregation process.",
    "GPT is Not an Annotator: The Necessity of Human Annotation in Fairness Benchmark Construction": "Social biases in LLMs are usually measured via bias benchmark datasets. Current benchmarks have limitations in scope, grounding, quality, and human effort required. Previous work has shown success with a community-sourced, rather than crowd-sourced, approach to benchmark development. However, this work still required considerable effort from annotators with relevant lived experience. This paper explores whether an LLM (specifically, GPT-3.5-Turbo) can assist with the task of developing a bias benchmark dataset from responses to an open-ended community survey. We also extend the previous work to a new community and set of biases: the Jewish community and antisemitism. Our analysis shows that GPT-3.5-Turbo has poor performance on this annotation task and produces unacceptable quality issues in its output. Thus, we conclude that GPT-3.5-Turbo is not an appropriate substitute for human annotation in sensitive tasks related to social biases, and that its use actually negates many of the benefits of community-sourcing bias benchmarks.",
    "GPU Poor's Guide to Radiology Report Generation": "Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to create free-text radiology reports from clinical imaging. Our solution employs a lightweight multimodal language model (MLLM) enhanced with a two-stage post-processing strategy, utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to boost diagnostic accuracy and ensure patient safety. We introduce the First, Do No Harm SafetyNet, which incorporates X-Raydar, an advanced X-ray classification model, to cross-verify the model outputs and specifically address false negative errors from the MLLM. This comprehensive approach combines the efficiency of lightweight models with the robustness of thorough post-processing techniques, offering a reliable solution for radiology report generation. Our system achieved fourth place on the F1-Radgraph metric for findings generation in the Radiology Report Generation Shared Task (RRG24).",
    "GradSafe: Detecting Jailbreak Prompts for LLMs via Safety-Critical Gradient Analysis": "Large Language Models (LLMs) face threats from jailbreak prompts. Existing methods for detecting jailbreak prompts are primarily online moderation APIs or finetuned LLMs. These strategies, however, often require extensive and resource-intensive data collection and training processes. In this study, we propose GradSafe, which effectively detects jailbreak prompts by scrutinizing the gradients of safety-critical parameters in LLMs. Our method is grounded in a pivotal observation: the gradients of an LLM's loss for jailbreak prompts paired with compliance response exhibit similar patterns on certain safety-critical parameters. In contrast, safe prompts lead to different gradient patterns. Building on this observation, GradSafe analyzes the gradients from prompts (paired with compliance responses) to accurately detect jailbreak prompts. We show that GradSafe, applied to Llama-2 without further training, outperforms Llama Guard—despite its extensive finetuning with a large dataset—in detecting jailbreak prompts. This superior performance is consistent across both zero-shot and adaptation scenarios, as evidenced by our evaluations on ToxicChat and XSTest. The source code is available at https://github.com/xyq7/GradSafe.",
    "Granular Analysis of Social Media Users' Truthfulness Stances Toward Climate Change Factual Claims": "Climate change poses an urgent global problem that requires efficient data analysis mechanisms to provide insights into climate change-related discussions on social media platforms. This paper presents a framework aimed at understanding social media users' perceptions of various climate change topics and uncovering the insights behind these perceptions. Our framework employs a large language model to develop a taxonomy of factual claims related to climate change and build a classification model that detects the truthfulness stance of tweets toward these factual claims. The findings reveal two key conclusions: (1) The public tends to believe the claims are true, regardless of the actual claim veracity; (2) The public shows a lack of discernment between facts and misinformation across different topics, particularly in areas related to politics, economy, and environment. This highlights the need for targeted attention, critical scrutiny, and informed engagement in these discussion areas.",
    "Graph Chain-of-Thought: Augmenting Large Language Models by Reasoning on Graphs": "Large language models (LLMs), while exhibiting exceptional performance, suffer from hallucinations, especially on knowledge-intensive tasks. Existing works propose to augment LLMs with individual text units retrieved from external knowledge corpora to alleviate the issue. However, in many domains, texts are interconnected (e.g., academic papers in a bibliographic graph are linked by citations and co-authorships) which form a (text-attributed) graph. The knowledge in such graphs is encoded not only in single texts/nodes but also in their associated connections. To facilitate the research of augmenting LLMs with graphs, we manually construct a Graph Reasoning Benchmark dataset called GRBENCH, containing 1,740 questions that can be answered with the knowledge from 10 domain graphs. Then, we propose a simple and effective framework called Graph Chain-of-thought (GRAPH-COT) to augment LLMs with graphs by encouraging LLMs to reason on the graph iteratively. Each GRAPH-COT iteration consists of three sub-steps: LLM reasoning, LLM-graph interaction, and graph execution. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on GRBENCH, where GRAPH-COT outperforms the baselines consistently. The code is available at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Graph-CoT.",
    "Graph Language Models": "While Language Models (LMs) are the workhorses of NLP, their interplay with structured knowledge graphs (KGs) is still actively researched. Current methods for encoding such graphs typically either (i) linearize them for embedding with LMs - which underutilize structural information, or (ii) use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to preserve the graph structure - but GNNs cannot represent text features as well as pretrained LMs. In our work we introduce a novel LM type, the Graph Language Model (GLM), that integrates the strengths of both approaches and mitigates their weaknesses. The GLM parameters are initialized from a pretrained LM to enhance understanding of individual graph concepts and triplets. Simultaneously, we design the GLM's architecture to incorporate graph biases, thereby promoting effective knowledge distribution within the graph. This enables GLMs to process graphs, texts, and interleaved inputs of both. Empirical evaluations on relation classification tasks show that GLM embeddings surpass both LM- and GNN-based baselines in supervised and zero-shot settings, demonstrating their versatility.",
    "Graph-Structured Speculative Decoding": "Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) by employing a small language model to draft a hypothesis sequence, which is then validated by the LLM. The effectiveness of this approach heavily relies on the balance between performance and efficiency of the draft model. In our research, we focus on enhancing the proportion of draft tokens that are accepted to the final output by generating multiple hypotheses instead of just one. This allows the LLM more options to choose from and select the longest sequence that meets its standards. Our analysis reveals that hypotheses produced by the draft model share many common token sequences, suggesting a potential for optimizing computation. Leveraging this observation, we introduce an innovative approach utilizing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to manage the drafted hypotheses. This structure enables us to efficiently predict and merge recurring token sequences, vastly reducing the computational demands of the draft model. We term this approach Graph-structured Speculative Decoding (GSD). We apply GSD across a range of LLMs, including a 70-billion parameter LLaMA-2 model, and observe a remarkable speedup of 1.73× to 1.96×, significantly surpassing standard speculative decoding.",
    "GraphReason: Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models through A Graph-Based Verification Approach": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning capabilities, particularly when guided by specifically designed prompts in complex reasoning tasks such as math word problems. These models typically solve tasks using a chain-of-thought approach, which not only bolsters their reasoning abilities but also provides valuable insights into their problem-solving process. However, there is still significant room for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Some studies suggest that the integration of an LLM output verifier can boost reasoning accuracy without necessitating additional model training. In this paper, we follow these studies and introduce a novel graph-based method to further augment the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We posit that multiple solutions to a reasoning task, generated by an LLM, can be represented as a reasoning graph due to the logical connections between intermediate steps from different reasoning paths. Therefore, we propose the Reasoning Graph Verifier (GraphReason) to analyze and verify the solutions generated by LLMs. By evaluating these graphs, models can yield more accurate and reliable results. Our experimental results show that our graph-based verification method not only significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs but also outperforms existing verifier methods in terms of improving these models' reasoning performance.",
    "GroundingGPT: Language Enhanced Multi-modal Grounding Model": "Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks. However, these models often prioritize capturing global information and overlook the importance of perceiving local information. This limitation hinders their ability to effectively understand fine-grained details and handle grounding tasks that necessitate nuanced comprehension. Although some recent works have made strides in this, they have primarily focused on single-modality inputs. Therefore, we propose GroundingGPT, an end-to-end language enhanced multi-modal grounding model. It is designed to perform fine-grained grounding tasks for three modalities: image, video, and audio. To enhance the model's performance, we adopt a coarse-to-fine training strategy, utilizing a three-stage training approach to progressively enhance the model's semantic awareness and fine-grained understanding capabilities. Additionally, we employ a diversified stage-specific dataset construction pipeline, developing a multi-modal, multi-granularity dataset tailored for training the model in different stages. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves impressive fine-grained understanding of multi-modal inputs on grounding tasks while maintaining or improving its global comprehension capabilities.",
    "GrowOVER: How Can LLMs Adapt to Growing Real-World Knowledge?": "In the real world, knowledge is constantly evolving, which can render existing knowledge-based datasets outdated. This unreliability highlights the critical need for continuous updates to ensure both accuracy and relevance in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this, we propose GrowOVER-QA and GrowOVER-Dialogue, dynamic open-domain QA and dialogue benchmarks that undergo a continuous cycle of updates, keeping pace with the rapid evolution of knowledge. Our research indicates that retrieval-augmented language models (RaLMs) struggle with knowledge that has not been trained on or recently updated. Consequently, we introduce a novel retrieval-interactive language model framework, where the language model evaluates and reflects on its answers for further re-retrieval. Our exhaustive experiments demonstrate that our training-free framework significantly improves upon existing methods, performing comparably to or even surpassing continuously trained language models.",
    "GSM-PLUS: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating the Robustness of LLMs as Mathematical Problem Solvers": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various mathematical reasoning benchmarks. However, there are increasing debates regarding whether these models truly understand and apply mathematical knowledge or merely rely on shortcuts for mathematical reasoning. One essential and frequently occurring evidence is that when the math questions are slightly changed, LLMs can behave incorrectly. This motivates us to evaluate the robustness of LLMs' math reasoning capability by testing a wide range of question variations. We introduce the adversarial grade school math (GSM-PLUS) dataset, an extension of GSM8K augmented with various mathematical perturbations. Our experiments on 25 LLMs and 4 prompting techniques show that while LLMs exhibit different levels of math reasoning abilities, their performances are far from robust. In particular, even for problems that have been solved in GSM8K, LLMs can make mistakes when new statements are added or the question targets are altered. We also explore whether more robust performance can be achieved by composing existing prompting methods, in which we try an iterative method that generates and verifies each intermediate thought based on its reasoning goal and calculation result.",
    "Guiding Large Language Models via External Attention Prompting for Scientific Extreme Summarization": "Scientific extreme summarization, the task of generating concise one-sentence summaries (TLDRs) for scientific papers, presents significant challenges due to the need for deep domain-specific understanding and the ability to distill salient information. This study identifies the critical role of titles and keywords in enhancing TLDR generation through quantitative analysis. We propose a novel method, External Attention Prompting (EAP), which leverages LLMs by guiding them to focus on the most critical parts of the source text through varying degrees of attention signals. Our method employs Markdown emphasis syntax to annotate attention levels, enabling LLMs to prioritize salient information effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EAP significantly outperforms baseline methods across various LLMs and metrics in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Further evaluations by GPT-4 demonstrate that EAP can enable LLMs to generate TLDRs of higher human-aligned quality.",
    "GumbelSoft: Diversified Language Model Watermarking via the GumbelMax-trick": "Large language models (LLMs) excellently generate human-like text, but also raise concerns about misuse in fake news and academic dishonesty. Decoding-based watermark, particularly the GumbelMax-trick-based watermark (GM watermark), is a standout solution for safeguarding machine-generated texts due to its notable detectability. However, GM watermark encounters a major challenge with generation diversity, always yielding identical outputs for the same prompt, negatively impacting generation diversity and user experience. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new type of GM watermark, the Logits-Addition watermark, and its three variants, specifically designed to enhance diversity. Among these, the GumbelSoft watermark (a softmax variant of the Logits-Addition watermark) demonstrates superior performance in high diversity settings, with its AUROC score outperforming those of the two alternative variants by 0.1 to 0.3 and surpassing other decoding-based watermarking methods by a minimum of 0.1.",
    "GunStance: Stance Detection for Gun Control and Gun Regulation": "The debate surrounding gun control and gun regulation in the United States has intensified in the wake of numerous mass shooting events. As perspectives on this matter vary, it becomes increasingly important to comprehend individuals' positions. Stance detection, the task of determining an author's position towards a proposition or target, has gained attention for its potential use in understanding public perceptions towards controversial topics and identifying the best strategies to address public concerns. In this paper, we present GUNSTANCE, a dataset of tweets pertaining to shooting events, focusing specifically on the controversial topics of “banning guns” and “regulating guns.” The tweets in the dataset are sourced from discussions on Twitter following various shooting incidents in the United States. Amazon Mechanical Turk was used to manually annotate a subset of the tweets relevant to the targets of interest (“banning guns” and “regulating guns”) into three classes: In-Favor, Against, and Neutral. The remaining unlabeled tweets are included in the dataset to facilitate studies on semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches that can help address the scarcity of the labeled data in stance detection tasks. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid approach that combines curriculum-based SSL and Large Language Models (LLM), and show that the proposed approach outperforms supervised, semi-supervised, and LLM-based zero-shot models in most experiments on our assembled dataset. The dataset and code are available on GitHub.",
    "Harnessing Large Language Models as Post-hoc Correctors": "As Machine Learning (ML) models grow in size and demand higher-quality training data, the expenses associated with re-training and fine-tuning these models are escalating rapidly. Inspired by recent impressive achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) in different fields, this paper delves into the question: can LLMs efficiently improve an ML's performance at a minimal cost? We show that, through our proposed training-free framework LLMCORR, an LLM can work as a post-hoc corrector to propose corrections for the predictions of an arbitrary ML model. In particular, we form a contextual knowledge database by incorporating the dataset's label information and the ML model's predictions on the validation dataset. Leveraging the in-context learning capability of LLMs, we ask the LLM to summarise the instances in which the ML model makes mistakes and the correlation between primary predictions and true labels. Following this, the LLM can transfer its acquired knowledge to suggest corrections for the ML model's predictions. Our experimental results on text analysis and the challenging molecular predictions show that LLMCORR improves the performance of a number of models by up to 39%.",
    "Harnessing the Power of Large Language Models for Natural Language to First-Order Logic Translation": "Advancements in logical reasoning, utilizing LLMs to convert natural language into logical symbolism, combined with the use of external theorem provers, have repositioned the symbolic approach as a central point of interest. The main challenge within this paradigm lies in the LLMs' capability to accurately translate natural language (NL) statements into first-order-logic (FOL) expressions. Although LLMs have shown notable success, there remains a gap in understanding the limitations and challenges they encounter in NL-FOL translation. This is primarily due to the absence of datasets and evaluation test beds at the required fine-grained level. We present MALLS, a dataset of 28K diverse and verified sentence-level NL-FOL pairs collected from GPT4. We utilize a combined strategy of FOL rule parsing, human annotation, and automatic filtering to ensure quality. We also present LOGICLLAMA, a LLaMA2-7B/13B fine-tuned on MALLS for NL-FOL translation, which can be used standalone or to correct previously generated rules by GPT3.5 after being further fine-tuned via a novel reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) framework. We benchmark a wide range of LLMs on MALLS and previous datasets, highlighting weaknesses in them in NL-FOL translation and demonstrating the advantages of MALLS. We also show that LOGICLLAMA achieves GPT4-level performance and can generalize to other datasets.",
    "Harnessing Toulmin's theory for zero-shot argument explication": "To better analyze informal arguments on public forums, we propose the task of argument explication, which makes explicit an argument's structure and implicit reasoning by outputting triples of propositions 〈claim, reason, warrant〉. The three slots, or argument components, are derived from the widely known Toulmin (1958) model of argumentation. While prior research applies Toulmin or related theories to annotate datasets and train supervised models, we develop an effective method to prompt generative large language models (LMs) to output explicitly named argument components proposed by Toulmin. In particular, we prompt a language model with the theory name (e.g., 'According to Toulmin model'). We evaluate the outputs' validity through a human study and automatic evaluation based on prior argumentation datasets, and perform robustness checks over alternative LMs, prompts, and argumentation theories. Finally, we conduct a proof-of-concept case study to extract an interpretable argumentation (hyper)graph from a large corpus of critical public comments on whether to allow the COVID-19 vaccine for children, suggesting future directions for corpus analysis and argument visualization.",
    "HBUT at # SMM4H 2024 Task1: Extraction and Normalization of Adverse Drug Events with a Large Language Model": "In this paper, we describe our proposed systems for the Social Media Mining for Health 2024 shared task 1. We built our system on the basis of GLM, a pre-trained large language model with few-shot learning capabilities, using a two-step prompting strategy to extract adverse drug events (ADEs) and an ensemble method for normalization. In the first step of extraction phase, we extract all the potential ADEs with in-context few-shot learning. In the second step for extraction, we let GLM to filter out false positive outputs in the first step by a tailored prompt. Then we normalize each ADE to its MedDRA preferred term ID (ptID) by an ensemble method using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our method achieved an excellent recall rate. It obtained 41.1%, 42.8%, and 40.6% recall rate for ADE normalization, ADE recognition, and normalization for unseen ADEs, respectively. Compared to the performance of the average and median among all the participants in terms of recall rate, our recall rate scores are generally 10%-20% higher than the other participants' systems.",
    "HBUT at #SMM4H 2024 Task2: Cross-lingual Few-shot Medical Entity Extraction using a Large Language Model": "Named entity recognition (NER) of drug and disorder/body function mentions in web text is challenging in the face of multilingualism, limited data, and poor data quality. Traditional small-scale models struggle to cope with the task. Large language models with conventional prompts also yield poor results. In this paper, we introduce our system, which employs a large language model (LLM) with a novel two-step prompting strategy. Instead of directly extracting the target medical entities, our system firstly extracts all entities and then prompts the LLM to extract drug and disorder entities given the all-entity list and original input text as the context. The experimental and test results indicate that this strategy successfully enhanced our system performance, especially for German language. Our code is available on Github.",
    "HD-EVAL: Aligning Large Language Model Evaluators Through Hierarchical Criteria Decomposition": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to expensive human evaluations. However, the alignment and coverage of LLM-based evaluations are often limited by the scope and potential bias of the evaluation prompts and criteria. To address this challenge, we propose HD-EVAL, a novel framework that iteratively aligns LLM-based evaluators with human preference via Hierarchical Criteria Decomposition. HD-EVAL inherits the essence from the evaluation mindset of human experts and enhances the alignment of LLM-based evaluators by decomposing a given evaluation task into finer-grained criteria, aggregating them according to estimated human preferences, pruning insignificant criteria with attribution, and further decomposing significant criteria. By integrating these steps within an iterative alignment training process, we obtain a hierarchical decomposition of criteria that comprehensively captures aspects of natural language at multiple levels of granularity. Implemented as a white box, the human preference-guided aggregator is efficient to train and more explainable than relying solely on prompting, and its independence from model parameters makes it applicable to closed-source LLMs. Extensive experiments on three evaluation domains demonstrate the superiority of HD-EVAL in further aligning state-of-the-art evaluators and providing deeper insights into the explanation of evaluation results and the task itself.",
    "HealMe: Harnessing Cognitive Reframing in Large Language Models for Psychotherapy": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can play a vital role in psychotherapy by adeptly handling the crucial task of cognitive reframing and overcoming challenges such as shame, distrust, therapist skill variability, and resource scarcity. Previous LLMs in cognitive reframing mainly converted negative emotions to positive ones, but these approaches have limited efficacy, often not promoting clients' self-discovery of alternative perspectives. In this paper, we unveil the Helping and Empowering through Adaptive Language in Mental Enhancement (HealMe) model. This novel cognitive reframing therapy method effectively addresses deep-rooted negative thoughts and fosters rational, balanced perspectives. Diverging from traditional LLM methods, HealMe employs empathetic dialogue based on psychotherapeutic frameworks. It systematically guides clients through distinguishing circumstances from feelings, brainstorming alternative viewpoints, and developing empathetic, actionable suggestions. Moreover, we adopt the first comprehensive and expertly crafted psychological evaluation metrics, specifically designed to rigorously assess the performance of cognitive reframing, in both AI-simulated dialogues and real-world therapeutic conversations. Experimental results show that our model outperforms others in terms of empathy, guidance, and logical coherence, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential positive impact on psychotherapy.",
    "HelloFresh: LLM Evaluations on Streams of Real-World Human Editorial Actions across X Community Notes and Wikipedia edits": "Benchmarks have been essential for driving progress in machine learning. A better understanding of LLM capabilities on real-world tasks is vital for safe development. Designing adequate LLM benchmarks is challenging: Data from real-world tasks is hard to collect, public availability of static evaluation data results in test data contamination and benchmark overfitting, and periodically generating new evaluation data is tedious and may result in temporally inconsistent results. We introduce HelloFresh, based on continuous streams of real-world data generated by intrinsically motivated human labelers. It covers recent events from X (formerly Twitter) community notes and edits of Wikipedia pages, mitigating the risk of test data contamination and benchmark overfitting. Any X user can propose an X note to add additional context to a misleading post (formerly tweet); if the community classifies it as helpful, it is shown with the post. Similarly, Wikipedia relies on community-based consensus, allowing users to edit articles or revert edits made by other users. Verifying whether an X note is helpful or whether a Wikipedia edit should be accepted are hard tasks that require grounding by querying the web. We backtest state-of-the-art LLMs supplemented with simple web search access and find that HelloFresh yields a temporally consistent ranking. To enable continuous evaluation on HelloFresh, we host a public leaderboard and periodically updated evaluation data at https://tinyurl.com/hello-fresh-LLM.",
    "Helping LLMs Know The Drill in Low-Resource Settings": "The amount of data to fine-tune LLMs plays a crucial role in the performance of these models in downstream tasks. Consequently, it is not straightforward to deploy these models in low-resource settings. In this work, we investigate two new multi-task learning data augmentation approaches for fine-tuning LLMs when little data is available: In-domain Augmentation of the training data and extracting Drills as smaller tasks from the target dataset. We evaluate the proposed approaches in three natural language processing settings in the context of SMM4H 2024 competition tasks: multi-class classification, entity recognition, and information extraction. The results show that both techniques improve the performance of the models in all three settings, suggesting a positive impact from the knowledge learned in multi-task training to perform the target task.",
    "Here's a Free Lunch: Sanitizing Backdoored Models with Model Merge": "The democratization of pre-trained language models through open-source initiatives has rapidly advanced innovation and expanded access to cutting-edge technologies. However, this openness also brings significant security risks, including backdoor attacks, where hidden malicious behaviors are triggered by specific inputs, compromising natural language processing (NLP) system integrity and reliability. This paper suggests that merging a backdoored model with other homogeneous models can significantly remediate backdoor vulnerabilities even if such models are not entirely secure. In our experiments, we verify our hypothesis on various models (BERT-Base, RoBERTa-Large, Llama2-7B, and Mistral-7B) and datasets (SST-2, OLID, AG News, and QNLI). Compared to multiple advanced defensive approaches, our method offers an effective and efficient inference-stage defense against backdoor attacks on classification and instruction-tuned tasks without additional resources or specific knowledge. Our approach consistently outperforms recent advanced baselines, leading to an average of about 75% reduction in the attack success rate. Since model merging has been an established approach for improving model performance, the extra advantage it provides regarding defense can be seen as a cost-free bonus.",
    "HeSum: a Novel Dataset for Abstractive Text Summarization in Hebrew": "While large language models (LLMs) excel in various natural language tasks in English, their performance in lower-resourced languages like Hebrew, especially for generative tasks such as abstractive summarization, remains unclear. The high morphological richness in Hebrew adds further challenges due to the ambiguity in sentence comprehension and the complexities in meaning construction. In this paper, we address this resource and evaluation gap by introducing HeSum, a novel benchmark specifically designed for abstractive text summarization in Modern Hebrew. HeSum consists of 10,000 article-summary pairs sourced from Hebrew news websites written by professionals. Linguistic analysis confirms HeSum's high abstractness and unique morphological challenges. We show that HeSum presents distinct difficulties for contemporary state-of-the-art LLMs, establishing it as a valuable testbed for generative language technology in Hebrew, and MRLs generative challenges in general.",
    "HGP-NLP at BioLaySumm: Leveraging LoRA for Lay Summarization of Biomedical Research Articles using Seq2Seq Transformers": "Lay summarization aims to generate summaries of technical articles for non-experts, enabling easy comprehension for a general audience. The technical language used in research often hinders effective communication of scientific knowledge, making it difficult for non-experts to understand. Automatic lay summarization can enhance access to scientific literature, promoting interdisciplinary knowledge sharing and public understanding. This has become especially important for biomedical articles, given the current global need for clear medical information. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their remarkable language understanding capabilities, are ideal for abstractive summarization, helping to make complex information accessible to the public. This paper details our submissions to the BioLaySumm 2024 Shared Task: Lay Summarization of Biomedical Research Articles. We fine-tune and evaluate sequence-to-sequence models like T5 across various training dataset settings and optimization methods such as LoRA for lay summarization. Our submission achieved the 53rd position overall.",
    "Hide and Seek in Noise Labels: Noise-Robust Collaborative Active Learning with LLM-Powered Assistance": "Learning from noisy labels (LNL) is a challenge that arises in many real-world scenarios where collected training data can contain incorrect or corrupted labels. Most existing solutions identify noisy labels and adopt active learning to query human experts on them for denoising. In the era of large language models (LLMs), although we can reduce the human effort to improve these methods, their performances are still subject to accurately separating the clean and noisy samples from noisy data. In this paper, we propose an innovative collaborative learning framework NoiseAL based on active learning to combine LLMs and small models (SMs) for learning from noisy labels. During collaborative training, we first adopt two SMs to form a co-prediction network and propose a dynamic-enhanced threshold strategy to divide the noisy data into different subsets, then select the clean and noisy samples from these subsets to feed the active annotator LLMs to rectify noisy samples. Finally, we employ different optimization objectives to conquer subsets with different degrees of label noises. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world noise datasets further demonstrate the superiority of our framework over state-of-the-art baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/byuan186/NoiseAL.",
    "Hierarchical syntactic structure in human-like language models": "Language models (LMs) are a meeting point for cognitive modeling and computational linguistics. How should they be designed to serve as adequate cognitive models? To address this question, this study contrasts two Transformer-based LMs that share the same architecture. Only one of them analyzes sentences in terms of explicit hierarchical structure. Evaluating the two LMs against fMRI time series via the surprisal complexity metric, the results implicate the superior temporal gyrus. This underlines the need for hierarchical sentence structure in word-by-word models of human language comprehension.",
    "Hire a Linguist!: Learning Endangered Languages in LLMs with In-Context Linguistic Descriptions": "How can large language models (LLMs) process and translate endangered languages? Many languages lack a large corpus to train a decent LLM; therefore existing LLMs rarely perform well in unseen, endangered languages. On the contrary, we observe that 2000 endangered languages, though without a large corpus, have a grammar book or a dictionary. We propose LINGOLLM, a training-free approach to enable an LLM to process unseen languages that hardly occur in its pre-training. Our key insight is to demonstrate linguistic knowledge of an unseen language in an LLM's prompt, including a dictionary, a grammar book, and morphologically analyzed input text. We implement LINGOLLM on top of two models, GPT-4 and Mixtral, and evaluate their performance on 5 tasks across 8 endangered or low-resource languages. Our results show that LINGOLLM elevates translation capability from GPT-4's 0 to 10.5 BLEU for 10 language directions. Our findings demonstrate the tremendous value of linguistic knowledge in the age of LLMs for endangered languages. Our data, code, and model generations can be found at https://github.com/LeiLiLab/LingoLLM.",
    "HiRoPE: Length Extrapolation for Code Models Using Hierarchical Position Embedding": "Addressing the limitation of context length in large language models for code-related tasks is the primary focus of this paper. Existing LLMs are constrained by their pre-trained context lengths, leading to performance issues in handling long complex code sequences. Inspired by how human programmers navigate code, we introduce Hierarchical Rotary Position Embedding (HiRoPE), a novel approach that enhances the traditional rotary position embedding into a hierarchical format based on the hierarchical structure of source code. HiRoPE offers easy integration into existing LLMs without extra training costs. Our method is extensively evaluated with various LLMs, demonstrating stable performance in tasks such as language modeling and long code completion. We also introduce a new long code understanding task with real-world code projects, in hopes of promoting further development in this code-related field. Theoretically and experimentally, we find that HiRoPE also addresses the out-of-distribution issue in position encoding. Our HiRoPE significantly expands the context length capabilities of LLMs, enabling inference at lengths exponentially greater than the training length.",
    "HITSZ-HLT at SIGHAN-2024 dimABSA Task: Integrating BERT and LLM for Chinese Dimensional Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis": "This paper presents the winning system participating in the ACL 2024 workshop SIGHAN-10 shared task: Chinese dimensional aspect-based sentiment analysis (dimABSA). This task aims to identify four sentiment elements in restaurant reviews: aspect, category, opinion, and sentiment intensity evaluated in valence-arousal dimensions, providing a concise yet fine-grained sentiment description for user opinions. To tackle this task, we introduce a system that integrates BERT and large language models (LLM) to leverage their strengths. First, we explore their performance in entity extraction, relation classification, and intensity prediction. Based on preliminary experiments, we develop an integrated approach to fully utilize their advantages in different scenarios. Our system achieves first place in all subtasks and obtains a 41.7% F1-score in quadruple extraction.",
    "HITSZ-HLT at WASSA-2024 Shared Task 2: Language-agnostic Multi-task Learning for Explainability of Cross-lingual Emotion Detection": "This paper describes the system developed by the HITSZ-HLT team for WASSA-2024 Shared Task 2, which addresses two closely linked sub-tasks: Cross-lingual Emotion Detection and Binary Trigger Word Detection in tweets. The main goal of Shared Task 2 is to simultaneously identify the emotions expressed and detect the trigger words across multiple languages. To achieve this, we introduce a Language-agnostic Multi Task Learning (LaMTL) framework that integrates emotion prediction and emotion trigger word detection tasks. By fostering synergistic interactions between task-specific and task-agnostic representations, the LaMTL aims to mutually enhance emotional cues, ultimately improving the performance of both tasks. Additionally, we leverage large-scale language models to translate the training dataset into multiple languages, thereby fostering the formation of language-agnostic representations within the model, significantly enhancing the model's ability to transfer and perform well across multilingual data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework across both tasks, with a particular highlight on its success in achieving second place in sub-task 2.",
    "Holistic Exploration on Universal Decompositional Semantic Parsing: Architecture, Data Augmentation, and LLM Paradigm": "In this paper, we conduct a holistic exploration of Universal Decompositional Semantic (UDS) parsing, aiming to provide a more efficient and effective solution for semantic parsing and to envision the development prospects after the emergence of large language models (LLMs). To achieve this, we first introduce a cascade model for UDS parsing that decomposes the complex task into semantically appropriate subtasks. Our approach outperforms prior models while significantly reducing inference time. Furthermore, to further exploit the hierarchical and automated annotation process of UDS, we explore the use of syntactic information and pseudo-labels, both of which enhance UDS parsing. Lastly, we investigate ChatGPT's efficacy in handling the UDS task, highlighting its proficiency in attribute parsing but struggles in relation parsing, revealing that small parsing models still hold research significance.",
    "HOLMES: Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs for Multi-hop Question Answering using LLMs": "Given unstructured text, Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at answering simple (single-hop) questions. However, as the complexity of the questions increase, the performance of LLMs degrade. We believe this is due to the overhead associated with understanding the complex question followed by filtering and aggregating unstructured information in the raw text. Recent methods try to reduce this burden by integrating structured knowledge triples into the raw text, aiming to provide a structured overview that simplifies information processing. However, this simplistic approach is query-agnostic and the extracted facts are ambiguous as they lack context. To address these drawbacks and to enable LLMs to answer complex (multi-hop) questions with ease, we propose to use a knowledge graph (KG) that is context-aware and is distilled to contain query-relevant information. The use of our compressed distilled KG as input to the LLM results in our method utilizing up to 67% fewer tokens to represent the query relevant information present in the supporting documents, compared to the state-of-the-art (SoTA) method. Our experiments show consistent improvements over the SoTA across several metrics (EM, F1, BERTScore, and Human Eval) on two popular benchmark datasets (HotpotQA and MuSiQue).",
    "How Abilities in Large Language Models are Affected by Supervised Fine-tuning Data Composition": "Large language models (LLMs) with enormous pre-training tokens and parameters emerge diverse abilities, including math reasoning, code generation, and instruction following. These abilities are further enhanced by supervised fine-tuning (SFT). While the open-source community has explored ad-hoc SFT for enhancing individual capabilities, proprietary LLMs exhibit versatility across various skills. Therefore, understanding the facilitation of multiple abilities via SFT is paramount. In this study, we specifically focus on the interplay of data composition between mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general human-aligning abilities during SFT. We propose four intriguing research questions to explore the association between model performance and various factors including data amount, composition ratio, model size, and SFT strategies. Our experiments reveal that distinct capabilities scale differently and larger models generally show superior performance with the same amount of data. Mathematical reasoning and code generation consistently improve with increasing data amount, whereas general abilities plateau after roughly a thousand samples. Moreover, we observe data composition appears to enhance various abilities under limited data conditions, yet can lead to performance conflicts when data is plentiful. Our findings also suggest the amount of composition data influences performance more than the composition ratio. In analysis of SFT strategies, we find that sequentially learning multiple skills risks catastrophic forgetting. Our proposed Dual-stage Mixed Fine-tuning (DMT) strategy offers a promising solution to learn multiple abilities with different scaling patterns.",
    "How can large language models become more human?": "Psycholinguistic experiments reveal that efficiency of human language use is founded on predictions at both syntactic and lexical levels. Previous models of human prediction exploiting LLMs have used an information theoretic measure called surprisal, with success on naturalistic text in a wide variety of languages, but under-performance on challenging text such as garden path sentences. This paper introduces a novel framework that combines the lexical predictions of an LLM with the syntactic structures provided by a dependency parser. The framework gives rise to an Incompatibility Fraction. When tested on two garden path datasets, it correlated well with human reading times, distinguished between easy and hard garden path, and outperformed surprisal.",
    "How Do Moral Emotions Shape Political Participation?": "Understanding the interplay between emotions in language and user behaviors is critical. We study how moral emotions shape the political participation of users based on cross-cultural online petition data. To quantify moral emotions, we employ a context-aware NLP model that is designed to capture the subtle nuances of emotions across cultures. For model training, we construct and share a moral emotion dataset comprising nearly 50,000 petition sentences in Korean and English each, along with emotion labels annotated by a fine-tuned LLM. We examine two distinct types of user participation: general support (i.e., registered signatures of petitions) and active support (i.e., sharing petitions on social media). We discover that moral emotions like other-suffering increase both forms of participation and help petitions go viral, while self-conscious have the opposite effect. The most prominent moral emotion, other-condemning, led to polarizing responses among the audience. In contrast, other-praising was perceived differently by culture; it led to a rise in active support in Korea but a decline in the UK. Our findings suggest that both moral emotions embedded in language and cultural perceptions are critical to shaping the public's political discourse.",
    "How do you know that? Teaching Generative Language Models to Reference Answers to Biomedical Questions": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently become the leading source of answers for users' questions online. Despite their ability to offer eloquent answers, their accuracy and reliability can pose a significant challenge. This is especially true for sensitive domains such as biomedicine, where there is a higher need for factually correct answers. This paper introduces a biomedical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to enhance the reliability of generated responses. The system is based on a fine-tuned LLM for the referenced question-answering, where retrieved relevant abstracts from PubMed are passed to LLM's context as input through a prompt. Its output is an answer based on PubMed abstracts, where each statement is referenced accordingly, allowing the users to verify the answer. Our retrieval system achieves an absolute improvement of 23% compared to the PubMed search engine. Based on the manual evaluation on a small sample, our fine-tuned LLM component achieves comparable results to GPT-4 Turbo in referencing relevant abstracts. We make the dataset used to fine-tune the models and the fine-tuned models based on Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.1 and v0.2 publicly available.",
    "How Johnny Can Persuade LLMs to Jailbreak Them: Rethinking Persuasion to Challenge AI Safety by Humanizing LLMs": "Most traditional AI safety research views models as machines and centers on algorithm-focused attacks developed by security experts. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly common and competent, non-expert users can also impose risks during daily interactions. Observing this, we shift the perspective, by treating LLMs as human-like communicators to examine the interplay between everyday language interaction and AI safety. Specifically, we study how to persuade LLMs to jailbreak them. First, we propose a persuasion taxonomy derived from decades of social science research. Then, we apply the taxonomy to automatically generate persuasive adversarial prompts (PAP) to jailbreak LLMs. Results show that persuasion significantly increases the jailbreak risk across all risk categories: PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over 92% on Llama-2-7b-Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 in 10 trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks. On the defense side, we explore various mechanisms against PAP, find a significant gap in existing defenses, and advocate for more fundamental solutions for AI safety.",
    "How Proficient Are Large Language Models in Formal Languages? An In-Depth Insight for Knowledge Base Question Answering": "Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language questions based on facts in knowledge bases. A typical approach to KBQA is semantic parsing, which translates a question into an executable logical form in a formal language. Recent works leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for logical form generation to improve performance. However, although it is validated that LLMs are capable of solving some KBQA problems, there has been little discussion on the differences in LLMs' proficiency in formal languages used in semantic parsing. In this work, we propose to evaluate the understanding and generation ability of LLMs to deal with differently structured logical forms by examining the inter-conversion of natural and formal language through in-context learning of LLMs. Extensive experiments with models of different sizes show that state-of-the-art LLMs can understand formal languages as well as humans, but generating correct logical forms given a few examples remains a challenge. Most importantly, our results also indicate that LLMs exhibit considerable sensitivity. In general, the formal language with a lower formalization level, i.e., the more similar it is to natural language, is more friendly to LLMs. Code and data can be found at https://github.com/Matthewlliu/structure_probe.",
    "How to Handle Different Types of Out-of-Distribution Scenarios in Computational Argumentation? A Comprehensive and Fine-Grained Field Study": "The advent of pre-trained Language Models (LMs) has markedly advanced natural language processing, but their efficacy in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios remains a significant challenge (Hupkes et al., 2023). The field of computational argumentation (CA), modeling human argumentation processes, is notably impacted by these challenges because complex annotation schemes and high annotation costs naturally lead to resources barely covering the multiplicity of available text sources and topics. Due to this data scarcity, generalization to data from uncovered covariant distributions is a common challenge for CA tasks like stance detection or argument classification. This work systematically assesses LMs' capabilities for such OOD scenarios. While previous work targets specific OOD types like topic shifts (Stab et al., 2018) or OOD uniformly (Yuan et al., 2023), we address three prevalent OOD scenarios in CA: topic shift, domain shift, and language shift. Our findings challenge the previously asserted general superiority of in-context learning (ICL) for OOD. We find that the efficacy of such learning paradigms varies with the type of OOD. Specifically, while ICL excels for domain shifts with heavy label divergences between train and test data, prompt-based fine-tuning surpasses for shifts when semantic differences prevail, like topic shifts. Navigating the heterogeneity of OOD scenarios in CA, our work empirically underscores the potential of base-sized LMs to overcome these challenges.",
    "How Useful is Context, Actually? Comparing LLMs and Humans on Discourse Marker Prediction": "This paper investigates the adverbial discourse particle actually. We compare LLM and human performance on cloze tests involving actually on examples sourced from the Providence Corpus of speech around children. We explore the impact of utterance context on cloze test performance. We find that context is always helpful, though the extent to which additional context is helpful, and what relative placement of context (i.e. before or after the masked word) is most helpful differs for individual models and humans. The best-performing LLM, GPT-4, narrowly outperforms humans. In an additional experiment, we explore cloze performance on synthetic LLM-generated examples, and find that several models vastly outperform humans.",
    "How Useful is Continued Pre-Training for Generative Unsupervised Domain Adaptation?": "Recent breakthroughs in scale have enabled the emergence of powerful generative language models, and the ability to fine-tune these models on various tasks by casting them into prompts or instructions. In this landscape, the problem of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), or the problem of leveraging knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, has been left behind, with recent UDA methods still addressing discriminative classification. In particular, two popular UDA approaches, involving Continued Pre-Training (CPT) and learning domain invariant representations, have been under-explored in the generative setting, signaling a gap. In this work, we evaluate the utility of CPT for generative UDA. We first perform an empirical evaluation to measure the trade-offs between CPT and strong methods promoting domain invariance. We further evaluate how well the benefits of CPT extend to different architectures, tuning methods and data regimes. We then motivate the use of CPT by studying to what degree it benefits classification performance on the target domain. Finally, we attempt to understand the mechanism behind which CPT improves classification performance on the unlabeled target domain. Our findings suggest that the model implicitly learns the downstream task while predicting masked words informative to that task. Our work connects the body of UDA research with that of instruction tuning, enabling an initial step towards a wider applicability of modern language models. Our code is available at https://github.com/Uppaal/cpt-generative-uda.",
    "How Vocabulary Sharing Facilitates Multilingualism in LLaMA?": "Large Language Models (LLMs), often show strong performance on English tasks, while exhibiting limitations on other languages. What is an LLM's multilingual capability when it is trained only on certain languages? The underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study endeavors to examine the multilingual capability of LLMs from the vocabulary sharing perspective by conducting an exhaustive analysis across 101 languages. Through the investigation of the performance gap before and after embedding fine-tuning, we discovered four distinct quadrants. By delving into each quadrant we provide actionable and efficient guidelines for tuning these languages. Extensive experiments reveal that existing LLMs possess multilingual capabilities that surpass our expectations, and we can significantly improve the multilingual performance of LLMs based on these attributes of each quadrant.",
    "How Well Can GPT Tackle Contextualizing Scientific Figures and Tables": "Identifying the alignment between different parts of a scientific paper is fundamental to scholarly document processing. In the Context24 shared task, participants are given a scientific claim and asked to identify (1) key figures or tables that support the claim and (2) methodological details. While employing a supervised approach to train models on task-specific data is a prevailing strategy for both subtasks, such an approach is not feasible for low-resource domains. Therefore, this paper introduces data-free systems supported by Large Language Models. We propose systems based on GPT-4o and GPT-4-turbo for each task. The experimental results reveal the zero-shot capabilities of GPT-4* in both tasks.",
    "HQP: A Human-Annotated Dataset for Detecting Online Propaganda": "Online propaganda poses a severe threat to the integrity of societies. However, existing datasets for detecting online propaganda have a key limitation: they were annotated using weak labels that can be noisy and even incorrect. To address this limitation, our work makes the following contributions: (1) We present HQP: a novel dataset (N = 30,000) for detecting online propaganda with high-quality labels. To the best of our knowledge, HQP is the first large-scale dataset for detecting online propaganda that was created through human annotation. (2) We show empirically that state-of-the-art language models fail in detecting online propaganda when trained with weak labels (AUC: 64.03). In contrast, state-of-the-art language models can accurately detect online propaganda when trained with our high-quality labels (AUC: 92.25), which is an improvement of ∼44%. (3) We show that prompt-based learning using a small sample of high-quality labels can still achieve a reasonable performance (AUC: 80.27) while significantly reducing the cost of labeling. (4) We extend HQP to HQP+ to test how well propaganda across different contexts can be detected. Crucially, our work highlights the importance of high-quality labels for sensitive NLP tasks such as propaganda detection.",
    "HRGraph: Leveraging LLMs for HR Data Knowledge Graphs with Information Propagation-based Job Recommendation": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) serving as semantic networks, prove highly effective in managing complex interconnected data in different domains, by offering a unified, contextualized, and structured representation with flexibility that allows for easy adaptation to evolving knowledge. Processing complex Human Resources (HR) data, KGs can help in different HR functions like recruitment, job matching, identifying learning gaps, and enhancing employee retention. Despite their potential, limited efforts have been made to implement practical HR knowledge graphs. This study addresses this gap by presenting a framework for effectively developing HR knowledge graphs from documents using Large Language Models. The resulting KG can be used for a variety of downstream tasks, including job matching, identifying employee skill gaps, and many more. In this work, we showcase instances where HR KGs prove instrumental in precise job matching, yielding advantages for both employers and employees. Empirical evidence from experiments with information propagation in KGs and Graph Neural Nets, along with case studies underscores the effectiveness of KGs in tasks such as job and employee recommendations and job area classification.",
    "Adaptation of BioBART and Longformer models to summarizing biomedical documents": "This article presents our submission to the BioLaySumm 2024 shared task: Lay Summarization of Biomedical Research Articles. The objective of this task is to generate summaries that are simplified in a concise and less technical way, in order to facilitate comprehension by non-experts users. A pre-trained BioBART model was employed to fine-tune the articles from the two journals, thereby generating two models, one for each journal. The submission achieved the 12th best ranking in the task, attaining a meritorious first place in the Relevance ROUGE-1 metric.",
    "Human Speech Perception in Noise: Can Large Language Models Paraphrase to Improve It?": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate text by transferring style attributes like formality resulting in formal or informal text. However, instructing LLMs to generate text that when spoken, is more intelligible in an acoustically difficult environment, is an under-explored topic. We conduct the first study to evaluate LLMs on a novel task of generating acoustically intelligible paraphrases for better human speech perception in noise. Our experiments in English demonstrated that with standard prompting, LLMs struggle to control the non-textual attribute, i.e., acoustic intelligibility, while efficiently capturing the desired textual attributes like semantic equivalence. To remedy this issue, we propose a simple prompting approach, prompt-and-select, which generates paraphrases by decoupling the desired textual and non-textual attributes in the text generation pipeline. Our approach resulted in a 40% relative improvement in human speech perception, by paraphrasing utterances that are highly distorted in a listening condition with babble noise at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) −5 dB. This study reveals the limitation of LLMs in capturing non-textual attributes, and our proposed method showcases the potential of using LLMs for better human speech perception in noise.",

    "Human-Centered Design Recommendations for LLM-as-a-Judge": "Traditional reference-based metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are less effective for assessing outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) that produce highly creative or superior-quality text, or in situations where reference outputs are unavailable. While human evaluation remains an option, it is costly and difficult to scale. Recent work using LLMs as evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge) is promising, but trust and reliability remain a significant concern. Integrating human input is crucial to ensure criteria used to evaluate are aligned with the human's intent, and evaluations are robust and consistent. This paper presents a user study of a design exploration called EvaluLLM, that enables users to leverage LLMs as customizable judges, promoting human involvement to balance trust and cost-saving potential with caution. Through interviews with eight domain experts, we identified the need for assistance in developing effective evaluation criteria aligning the LLM-as-a-judge with practitioners' preferences and expectations. We offer findings and design recommendations to optimize human-assisted LLM-as-judge systems.",
    "HW-TSC at TextGraphs-17 Shared Task: Enhancing Inference Capabilities of LLMs with Knowledge Graphs": "In this paper, we present an effective method for TextGraphs-17 Shared Task. This task requires selecting an entity from the candidate entities that is relevant to the given question and answer. The selection process is aided by utilizing the shortest path graph in the knowledge graph, connecting entities in the query to the candidate entity. This task aims to explore how to enhance LLMs output with KGs, although current LLMs have certain logical reasoning capabilities, they may not be certain about their own outputs, and the answers they produce may be correct by chance through incorrect paths. In this case, we have introduced a LLM prompt design strategy based on self-ranking and emotion. Specifically, we let the large model score its own answer choices to reflect its confidence in the answer. Additionally, we add emotional incentives to the prompts to encourage the model to carefully examine the questions. Our submissions were conducted under zero-resource setting, and we achieved the second place in the task with an F1-score of 0.8321.",
    "HW-TSC's Speech to Text Translation System for IWSLT 2024 in Indic track": "This article introduces the process of HW-TSC and the results of IWSLT 2024 Indic Track Speech to Text Translation. We designed a cascade system consisting of an ASR model and a machine translation model to translate speech from one language to another. For the ASR part, we directly use whisper large v3 as our ASR model. Our main task is to optimize the machine translation model (en2ta, en2hi, en2bn). In the process of optimizing the translation model, we first use bilingual corpus to train the baseline model. Then we use monolingual data to construct pseudo-corpus data to further enhance the baseline model. Finally, we filter the parallel corpus data through the labse(Feng et al., 2022) filtering method and finetune the model again, which can further improve the BLEU score. We also selected domain data from bilingual corpus to finetune previous model to achieve the best results.",
    "HW-TSC's submission to the IWSLT 2024 Subtitling track": "This paper introduces HW-TSC's submission to the IWSLT 2024 Subtitling track. For the automatic subtitling track, we use an unconstrained cascaded strategy, with the main steps being: ASR with word-level timestamps, sentence segmentation based on punctuation restoration, further alignment using CTC or using machine translation with length penalty. For the subtitle compression track, we employ a subtitle compression strategy that integrates machine translation models and extensive rewriting models. We acquire the subtitle text requiring revision through the CPS index, then utilize a translation model to obtain the English version of this text. Following this, we extract the compressed-length subtitle text through controlled decoding. If this method fails to compress the text successfully, we resort to the Llama2 few-shot model for further compression.",
    "Hybrid Alignment Training for Large Language Models": "Alignment training is crucial for enabling large language models (LLMs) to cater to human intentions and preferences. It is typically performed based on two stages with different objectives: instruction-following alignment and human-preference alignment. However, aligning LLMs with these objectives in sequence suffers from an inherent problem: the objectives may conflict, and the LLMs cannot guarantee to simultaneously align with the instructions and human preferences well. To response to these, in this work, we propose a Hybrid Alignment Training (HBAT) approach, based on alternating alignment and modified elastic weight consolidation methods. The basic idea is to alternate between different objectives during alignment training, so that better collaboration can be achieved between the two alignment tasks. We experiment with HBAT on summarization and dialogue tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed HBAT can significantly outperform all baselines. Notably, HBAT yields consistent performance gains over the traditional two-stage alignment training when using both proximal policy optimization and direct preference optimization.",
    "I am a Strange Dataset: Metalinguistic Tests for Language Models": "Statements involving metalinguistic self-reference (“This paper has six sections.”) are prevalent in many domains. Can current large language models (LLMs) handle such language? In this paper, we present “I am a Strange Dataset”, a new dataset for addressing this question. There are two subtasks: generation and verification. In generation, models continue statements like “The penultimate word in this sentence is” (where a correct continuation is “is”). In verification, models judge the truth of statements like “The penultimate word in this sentence is sentence.” (false). We also provide minimally different metalinguistic non-self-reference examples to complement the main dataset by probing for whether models can handle metalinguistic language at all. The dataset is hand-crafted by experts and validated by non-expert annotators. We test a variety of open-source LLMs (7B to 70B parameters) as well as closed-source LLMs through APIs. All models perform close to chance across both subtasks and even on the non-self-referential metalinguistic control data, though we find some steady improvement with model scale. GPT 4 is the only model to consistently do significantly better than chance, and it is still only in the 60% range, while our untrained human annotators score well in the 89-93% range.",
    "IBSEN: Director-Actor Agent Collaboration for Controllable and Interactive Drama Script Generation": "Large language models have demonstrated their capabilities in storyline creation and human-like character role-playing. Current language model agents mainly focus on reasonable behaviors from the level of individuals, and their behaviors might be hard to constraint on the level of the whole storyline. In this paper we introduce IBSEN, a director-actor coordinate agent framework that generates drama scripts and makes the plot played by agents more controllable. The director agent writes plot outlines that the user desires to see, instructs the actor agents to role-play their characters, and reschedules the plot when human players participate in the scenario to ensure the plot is progressing towards the objective. To evaluate the framework, we create a novel drama plot that involves several actor agents and check the interactions between them under the instruction of the director agent. Evaluation results show that our framework could generate complete, diverse drama scripts from only a rough outline of plot objectives, meanwhile maintaining the characteristics of characters in the drama. Our codes and prompts are available at https://github.com/OpenDFM/ibsen.",
    "ICLEF: In-Context Learning with Expert Feedback for Explainable Style Transfer": "While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) can excel at adapting text from one style to another, current work does not address the explainability of style transfer models. Recent work has explored generating textual explanations from larger teacher models and distilling them into smaller student models. One challenge with such approach is that LLM outputs may contain errors that require expertise to correct, but gathering and incorporating expert feedback is difficult due to cost and availability. To address this challenge, we propose ICLEF, a novel human-AI collaboration approach to model distillation that incorporates scarce expert human feedback by combining in-context learning and model self-critique. We show that our method leads to generation of high-quality synthetic explainable style transfer datasets for formality (E-GYAFC) and subjective bias (E-WNC). Via automatic and human evaluation, we show that specialized student models fine-tuned on our datasets outperform generalist teacher models on the explainable style transfer task in one-shot settings, and perform competitively compared to few-shot teacher models, highlighting the quality of the data and the role of expert feedback. In an extrinsic task of authorship attribution, we show that explanations generated by smaller models fine-tuned on E-GYAFC are more predictive of authorship than explanations generated by few-shot teacher models.",
    "Identifying Semantic Induction Heads to Understand In-Context Learning": "Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, the lack of transparency in their inference logic raises concerns about their trustworthiness. To gain a better understanding of LLMs, we conduct a detailed analysis of the operations of attention heads and aim to better understand the in-context learning of LLMs. Specifically, we investigate whether attention heads encode two types of relationships between tokens in natural languages: the syntactic dependency parsed from sentences and the relation within knowledge graphs. We find that certain attention heads exhibit a pattern where, when attending to head tokens, they recall tail tokens and increase the output logits of those tail tokens. More crucially, the formulation of such semantic induction heads has a close correlation with the emergence of the in-context learning ability of language models. The study of semantic attention heads advances our understanding of the intricate operations of attention heads in transformers, and further provides new insights into the in-context learning of LLMs.",
    "IEPILE: Unearthing Large-Scale Schema-Based Information Extraction Corpus": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential across various domains; however, they exhibit a significant performance gap in Information Extraction (IE). Note that high-quality instruction data is the vital key for enhancing the specific capabilities of LLMs, while current IE datasets tend to be small in scale, fragmented, and lack standardized schema. To this end, we introduce IEPILE, a comprehensive bilingual (English and Chinese) IE instruction corpus, which contains approximately 0.32B tokens. We construct IEPILE by collecting and cleaning 33 existing IE datasets, and introduce schema-based instruction generation to unearth a large-scale corpus. Experimentally, IEPILE enhance the performance of LLMs for IE, with notable improvements in zero-shot generalization. We open-source the resource and pre-trained models, hoping to provide valuable support to the NLP community.",
    "IgnitionInnovators at Discharge Me!: Chain-of-Thought Instruction Finetuning Large Language Models for Discharge Summaries": "This paper presents our proposed approach to the Discharge Me! shared task, collocated with the 23th Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP). In this work, we develop an LLM-based framework for solving the Discharge Summary Documentation (DSD) task, i.e., generating the two critical target sections 'Brief Hospital Course' and 'Discharge Instructions' in the discharge summary. By streamlining the recent instruction-finetuning process on LLMs, we explore several prompting strategies for optimally adapting LLMs to specific generation task of DSD. Experimental results show that providing a clear output structure, complimented by a set of comprehensive Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) questions, effectively improves the model's reasoning capability, and thereby, enhancing the structural correctness and faithfulness of clinical information in the generated text.",
    "iHealth-Chile-1 at RRG24: In-context Learning and Finetuning of a Large Multimodal Model for Radiology Report Generation": "This paper presents the approach of the iHealth-Chile-1 team for the shared task of Large-Scale Radiology Report Generation at the BioNLP workshop, inspired by progress in large multimodal models for processing images and text. In this work, we leverage LLaVA, a Visual-Language Model (VLM), composed of a vision-encoder, a vision-language connector or adapter, and a large language model able to process text and visual embeddings. We achieve our best result by enriching the input prompt of LLaVA with the text output of a simpler report generation model. With this enriched-prompt technique, we improve our results in 4 of 5 metrics (BLEU-4, Rouge-L, BertScore, and F1-RadGraph,), only doing in-context learning. Moreover, we provide details about different architecture settings, fine-tuning strategies, and dataset configurations. Models parameters can be found in HuggingFace 1.",
    "IL-TUR: Benchmark for Indian Legal Text Understanding and Reasoning": "Legal systems worldwide are inundated with exponential growth in cases and documents. There is an imminent need to develop NLP and ML techniques for automatically processing and understanding legal documents to streamline the legal system. However, evaluating and comparing various NLP models designed specifically for the legal domain is challenging. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing IL-TUR: Benchmark for Indian Legal Text Understanding and Reasoning. IL-TUR contains monolingual (English, Hindi) and multi-lingual (9 Indian languages) domain-specific tasks that address different aspects of the legal system from the point of view of understanding and reasoning over Indian legal documents. We present baseline models (including LLM-based) for each task, outlining the gap between models and the ground truth. To foster further research in the legal domain, we create a leaderboard (available at: https://exploration-lab.github.io/IL-TUR/) where the research community can upload and compare legal text understanding systems.",
    "imapScore: Medical Fact Evaluation Made Easy": "Automatic evaluation of natural language generation (NLG) tasks has gained extensive research interests, since it can rapidly assess the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, automatic NLG evaluation struggles with medical QA because it fails to focus on the crucial correctness of medical facts throughout the generated text. To address this, this paper introduces a new data structure, imap, designed to capture key information in questions and answers, enabling evaluators to focus on essential details. The imap comprises three components: Query, Constraint, and Inform, each of which is in the form of term-value pairs to represent medical facts in a structural manner. We then introduce imapScore, which compares the corresponding medical term-value pairs in the imap to score generated texts. We utilize GPT-4 to extract imap from questions, human-annotated answers, and generated responses. To mitigate the diversity in medical terminology for fair term-value pairs comparison, we use a medical knowledge graph to assist GPT-4 in determining matches. To compare imapScore with existing NLG metrics, we establish a new benchmark dataset. The experimental results show that imapScore consistently outperforms state-of-the-art metrics, demonstrating an average improvement of 79.8% in correlation with human scores. Furthermore, incorporating imap into n-gram, embedding, and LLM metrics boosts the base versions, increasing correlation with human scores by averages of 89.9%, 81.7%, and 32.6%, respectively.",
    "IMBUE: Improving Interpersonal Effectiveness through Simulation and Just-in-time Feedback with Human-Language Model Interaction": "Navigating certain communication situations can be challenging due to individuals' lack of skills and the interference of strong emotions. However, effective learning opportunities are rarely accessible. In this work, we conduct a human-centered study that uses language models to simulate bespoke communication training and provide just-in-time feedback to support the practice and learning of interpersonal effectiveness skills. We apply the interpersonal effectiveness framework from Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), DEAR MAN, which focuses on both conversational and emotional skills. We present IMBUE, an interactive training system that provides feedback 25% more similar to experts' feedback, compared to that generated by GPT-4. IMBUE is the first to focus on communication skills and emotion management simultaneously, incorporate experts' domain knowledge in providing feedback, and be grounded in psychology theory. Through a randomized trial of 86 participants, we find that IMBUE's simulation-only variant significantly improves participants' self-efficacy (up to 17%) and reduces negative emotions (up to 25%). With IMBUE's additional just-in-time feedback, participants demonstrate 17% improvement in skill mastery, along with greater enhancements in self-efficacy (27% more) and reduction of negative emotions (16% more) compared to simulation-only. The improvement in skill mastery is the only measure that is transferred to new and more difficult situations; situation-specific training is necessary for improving self-efficacy and emotion reduction.",
    "Impact of Decoding Methods on Human Alignment of Conversational LLMs": "To be included into chatbot systems, Large language models (LLMs) must be aligned with human conversational conventions. However, being trained mainly on web-scraped data gives existing LLMs a voice closer to informational text than actual human speech. In this paper, we examine the effect of decoding methods on the alignment between LLM-generated and human conversations, including Beam Search, Top K Sampling, and Nucleus Sampling. We present new measures of alignment in substance, style, and psychometric orientation, and experiment with two conversation datasets. Our results provide subtle insights: better alignment is attributed to fewer beams in Beam Search and lower values of P in Nucleus Sampling. We also find that task-oriented and open-ended datasets perform differently in terms of alignment, indicating the significance of taking into account the context of the interaction.",
    "Implanting LLM's Knowledge via Reading Comprehension Tree for Toxicity Detection": "Warning: This paper contains several toxic and offensive statements. Toxicity detection plays a crucial role in maintaining the peace of the society. Existing methods can be roughly categorized as small language model (SLM) based and large language model (LLM) based. However, due to the limitation of SLMs on general knowledge and the potential embedded bias in LLMs despite their large amount of knowledge, it is not a good idea to detect toxicity only with either SLM or LLM based method. In this work, we propose to implant LLM's knowledge into SLM based methods such that we can stick to both types of models' strengths. To this end, we develop a reading comprehension (RC) tree to transfer knowledge between two models. Specifically, we first construct the RC tree, from an extensive to intensive reading perspective, to capture the local and global information in the text. We then model samples encoded by SLM and knowledge extracted from LLM as two distributions using the constructed RT tree. We finally transfer knowledge via optimal transportation between two distributions. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of our method on real-world and machine-generated datasets. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/khk-abc/toxic-detection.",
    "ImplicaTR: A Granular Dataset for Natural Language Inference and Pragmatic Reasoning in Turkish": "We introduce ImplicaTR, a linguistically informed diagnostic dataset designed to evaluate semantic and pragmatic reasoning capabilities of Natural Language Inference (NLI) models in Turkish. Existing Turkish NLI datasets treat NLI as determining whether a sentence pair represents entailment, contradiction, or a neutral relation. Such datasets do not distinguish between semantic entailment and pragmatic implicature, which linguists have long recognized as separate inferences types. ImplicaTR addresses this by testing NLI models' ability to differentiate between entailment and implicature, thus assessing their pragmatic reasoning skills. The dataset consists of 19,350 semi-automatically generated sentence pairs covering implicature, entailment, contradiction, and neutral relations. We evaluated various models (BERT, Gemma, Llama-2, and Mistral) on ImplicaTR and found out that these models can reach up to 98% accuracy on semantic and pragmatic reasoning. We also fine-tuned various models on subsets of ImplicaTR to test the abilities of NLI models to generalize across unseen implicature contexts. Our results indicate that model performance is highly dependent on the diversity of linguistic expressions within each subset, highlighting a weakness in the abstract generalization capabilities of large language models regarding pragmatic reasoning.",
    "ImplicitAVE: An Open-Source Dataset and Multimodal LLMs Benchmark for Implicit Attribute Value Extraction": "Existing datasets for attribute value extraction (AVE) predominantly focus on explicit attribute values while neglecting the implicit ones, lack product images, are often not publicly available, and lack an in-depth human inspection across diverse domains. To address these limitations, we present ImplicitAVE, the first, publicly available multimodal dataset for implicit attribute value extraction. ImplicitAVE, sourced from the MAVE dataset, is carefully curated and expanded to include implicit AVE and multimodality, resulting in a refined dataset of 68k training and 1.6k testing data across five domains. We also explore the application of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to implicit AVE, establishing a comprehensive benchmark for MLLMs on the ImplicitAVE dataset. Six recent MLLMs with eleven variants are evaluated across diverse settings, revealing that implicit value extraction remains a challenging task for MLLMs. The contributions of this work include the development and release of ImplicitAVE, and the exploration and benchmarking of various MLLMs for implicit AVE, providing valuable insights and potential future research directions. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/HenryPengZou/ImplicitAVE.",
    "Improving Attributed Text Generation of Large Language Models via Preference Learning": "Large language models have been widely adopted in natural language processing, yet they face the challenge of generating unreliable content. Recent works aim to reduce misinformation and hallucinations by resorting to attribution as a means to provide evidence (i.e., citations). However, current attribution methods usually focus on the retrieval stage and automatic evaluation that neglect mirroring the citation mechanisms in human scholarly writing to bolster credibility. In this paper, we address these challenges by modeling the attribution task as preference learning and introducing an Automatic Preference Optimization (APO) framework. First, we create a curated collection for post-training with 6,330 examples by collecting and filtering from existing datasets. Second, considering the high cost of labeling preference data, we further propose an automatic method to synthesize attribution preference data resulting in 95,263 pairs. Moreover, inspired by the human citation process, we further propose a progressive preference optimization method by leveraging fine-grained information. Extensive experiments on three datasets (i.e., ASQA, StrategyQA, and ELI5) demonstrate that APO achieves state-of-the-art citation F1 with higher answer quality.",
    "Improving Conversational Abilities of Quantized Large Language Models via Direct Preference Alignment": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has facilitated their transformation into conversational chatbots that can grasp contextual nuances and generate pertinent sentences, closely mirroring human values through advanced techniques such as instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, the computational efficiency required for LLMs, achieved through techniques like post-training quantization (PTQ), presents challenges such as token-flipping that can impair chatbot performance. In response, we propose a novel preference alignment approach, quantization-aware direct preference optimization (QDPO), that aligns quantized LLMs with their full-precision counterparts, improving conversational abilities. Evaluated on two instruction-tuned LLMs in various languages, QDPO demonstrated superior performance in improving conversational abilities compared to established PTQ and knowledge-distillation fine-tuning techniques, marking a significant step forward in the development of efficient and effective conversational LLMs.",
    "Improving Event Definition Following For Zero-Shot Event Detection": "Existing approaches on zero-shot event detection usually train models on datasets annotated with known event types, and prompt them with unseen event definitions. These approaches yield sporadic successes, yet generally fall short of expectations. In this work, we aim to improve zero-shot event detection by training models to better follow event definitions. We hypothesize that a diverse set of event types and definitions are the key for models to learn to follow event definitions while existing event extraction datasets focus on annotating many high-quality examples for a few event types. To verify our hypothesis, we construct an automatically generated Diverse Event Definition (DivED) dataset and conduct comparative studies. Our experiments reveal that a large number of event types (200) and diverse event definitions can significantly boost event extraction performance; on the other hand, the performance does not scale with over ten examples per event type. Beyond scaling, we incorporate event ontology information and hard-negative samples during training, further boosting the performance. Based on these findings, we fine-tuned a LLaMA-2-7B model on our DivED dataset, yielding performance that surpasses SOTA large language models like GPT-3.5 across three open benchmarks on zero-shot event detection. Our code and data can be found at https://github.com/PlusLabNLP/ZeroED",
    "Improving Graph-based Generative Capability of LLMs": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown great abilities of solving various natural language tasks in different domains. Due to the training objective of LLMs and their pre-training data, LLMs are not very well equipped for tasks involving structured data generation. We propose a framework, Prompting with Iterative Verification (PiVe), to improve graph-based generative capability of LLMs. We show how a small language model could be trained to act as a verifier module for the output of an LLM (i.e., ChatGPT, GPT-4), and to iteratively improve its performance via fine-grained corrective instructions. We also show how the verifier module could apply iterative corrections offline for a more cost-effective solution to the text-to-graph generation task. Experiments on three graph-based datasets show consistent improvement gained via PiVe. Additionally, we create GenWiki-HIQ and highlight that the verifier module can be used as a data augmentation tool to help improve the quality of automatically generated parallel text-graph datasets.",
    "Improving In-Context Learning with Prediction Feedback for Sentiment Analysis": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved promising results in sentiment analysis through the in-context learning (ICL) paradigm. However, their ability to distinguish subtle sentiments still remains a challenge. Inspired by the human ability to adjust understanding via feedback, this paper enhances ICL by incorporating prior predictions and feedback, aiming to rectify sentiment misinterpretation of LLMs. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of three steps: (1) acquiring prior predictions of LLMs, (2) devising predictive feedback based on correctness, and (3) leveraging a feedback-driven prompt to refine sentiment understanding. Experimental results across nine sentiment analysis datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework over conventional ICL methods, with an average F1 improvement of 5.95%.",
    "Improving Language Models Trained on Translated Data with Continual Pre-Training and Dictionary Learning Analysis": "Training LLMs in low resources languages usually utilizes machine translation (MT) data augmentation from English language. However, translation brings a number of challenges: there are large costs attached to translating and curating huge amounts of content with high-end machine translation solutions; the translated content carries over cultural biases; and if the translation is not faithful and accurate, the quality of the data degrades causing issues in the trained model. In this work, we investigate the role of translation and synthetic data in training language models. We translate TinyStories, a dataset of 2.2M short stories for 3-4 year old children, from English to Arabic using the open NLLB-3B MT model. We train a number of story generation models of size 1M-33M parameters using this data. We identify a number of quality and task-specific issues in the resulting models. To rectify these issues, we further pre-train the models with a small dataset of synthesized high-quality stories generated by a capable LLM in Arabic, representing 1% of the original training data. We show, using GPT-4 as a judge and dictionary learning analysis from mechanistic interpretability, that the suggested approach is a practical means to resolve some of the translation pitfalls. We illustrate the improvement through case studies of linguistic and cultural bias issues.",
    "Improving Large Language Models in Event Relation Logical Prediction": "Event relations are crucial for narrative understanding and reasoning. Governed by nuanced logic, event relation extraction (ERE) is a challenging task that demands thorough semantic understanding and rigorous logical reasoning. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation to systematically explore the capability of LLMs in understanding and applying event relation logic. More in detail, we first investigate the deficiencies of LLMs in logical reasoning across different tasks. Our study reveals that LLMs are not logically consistent reasoners, which results in their suboptimal performance on tasks that need rigorous reasoning. To address this, we explore three different approaches to endow LLMs with event relation logic, and thus enable them to generate more coherent answers across various scenarios. Based on our approach, we also contribute a synthesized dataset (LLM-ERL) involving high-order reasoning for evaluation and fine-tuning. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on different tasks also validate the effectiveness of our approaches and provide insights for solving practical tasks with LLMs in future work.",
    "Improving Large Language Models via Fine-grained Reinforcement Learning with Minimum Editing Constraint": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely used in training large language models (LLMs) for preventing unexpected outputs, e.g., reducing harmfulness and errors. However, existing RL methods mainly adopt instance-level reward, which cannot provide fine-grained supervision for complex reasoning tasks. As a result, the RL training cannot be fully aware of the specific part or step that actually leads to the incorrectness in model response. To address it, we propose a new RL method named RLMEC that incorporates a generative model as the reward model, which is trained by the erroneous solution rewriting task under the minimum editing constraint, which can produce token-level supervision for RL training. Based on the generative reward model, we design the token-level RL objective for training and an imitation-based regularization for stabilizing RL process. And these two objectives focus on the revision of the key tokens for the erroneous solution, reducing the effect of other unimportant tokens. Experiment results on 8 tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. Our code and data will be publicly released.",
    "Improving LLM Generations via Fine-Grained Self-Endorsement": "This work studies mitigating fact-conflicting hallucinations for large language model (LLM) at inference time. Particularly, we propose a self-endorsement framework that leverages the fine-grained fact-level comparisons across multiple sampled responses. Compared with prior ensemble methods (e.g., self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023)) that perform response-level selection, our approach can better alleviate hallucinations for knowledge-intensive tasks. Our approach can broadly benefit smaller and open-source LLMs as it mainly conducts simple content-based comparisons. Experiments on Biographies show that our method can effectively improve the factuality of generations with simple and intuitive prompts across different scales of LLMs. Besides, comprehensive analyses on TriviaQA and GSM8K demonstrate the potential of self-endorsement for broader application.",
    "Improving LLM-based KGQA for multi-hop Question Answering with implicit reasoning in few-shot examples": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generating natural language texts for various tasks. However, using LLMs for question answering on knowledge graphs still remains a challenge, especially for questions requiring multi-hop reasoning. In this paper, we present a novel planned query guidance approach that improves large language model (LLM) performance in multi-hop question answering on knowledge graphs (KGQA). We do this by designing few-shot examples that implicitly demonstrate a systematic reasoning methodology to answer multi-hop questions. We evaluate our approach for two graph query languages, Cypher and SPARQL, and show that the queries generated using our strategy outperform the queries generated using a baseline LLM and typical few-shot examples by up to 24.66% and 7.7% in execution match accuracy for the MetaQA and the Spider benchmarks respectively. We also conduct an ablation study to analyze the incremental effects of the different techniques of designing few-shot examples. Our results suggest that our approach enables the LLM to effectively leverage the few-shot examples to generate queries for multi-hop KGQA.",
    "Improving Machine Translation with Large Language Models: A Preliminary Study with Cooperative Decoding": "Contemporary translation engines based on the encoder-decoder framework have made significant strides in development. However, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has disrupted their position by presenting the potential for achieving superior translation quality. To uncover the circumstances in which LLMs excel and explore how their strengths can be harnessed to enhance translation quality, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis to assess the strengths and limitations of various commercial NMT systems and MT-oriented LLMs. Our findings indicate that neither NMT nor MT-oriented LLMs alone can effectively address all the translation issues, but MT-oriented LLMs show promise as a complementary solution to NMT systems. Building upon these insights, we propose Cooperative Decoding (CoDec), which treats NMT systems as a pretranslation model and MT-oriented LLMs as a supplemental solution to handle complex scenarios beyond the capability of NMT alone. Experimental results on the WMT22 test sets and a newly collected test set WebCrawl demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CoDec, highlighting its potential as a robust solution for combining NMT systems with MT-oriented LLMs in the field of machine translation.",
    "Improving Retrieval Augmented Open-Domain Question-Answering with Vectorized Contexts": "In the era of large language models, applying techniques such as Retrieval Augmented Generation can better address Open-Domain Question-Answering problems. Due to constraints including model sizes and computing resources, the length of context is often limited, and it becomes challenging to empower the model to cover overlong contexts while answering questions from open domains. This paper proposes a general and convenient method to cover longer contexts in Open-Domain Question-Answering tasks. It leverages a small encoder and cross-attention mechanism and effectively encodes contexts. With our method, the original language models can cover several times longer contexts while keeping the computing requirements close to the baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that after fine-tuning, there is improved performance across two held-in datasets, four held-out datasets, and also in two In Context Learning settings. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/Vec-RA-ODQA.",
    "Improving Sentence Embeddings with Automatic Generation of Training Data Using Few-shot Examples": "Decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have shown high performance on many tasks in natural language processing. This is also true for sentence embedding learning, where a decoder-based model, PromptEOL, has achieved the best performance on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. However, PromptEOL requires a manually annotated natural language inference (NLI) dataset for fine-tuning. We aim to improve sentence embeddings without using large manually annotated datasets by automatically generating an NLI dataset with an LLM and using it for fine-tuning of PromptEOL. To achieve this, we explore methods of data generation suitable for sentence embedding learning in this study. Specifically, we will focus on automatic dataset generation through few-shot learning and explore the appropriate methods to leverage few-shot examples. Experimental results on the STS tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing models in settings without large manually annotated datasets.",
    "Improving Text Embeddings with Large Language Models": "In this paper, we introduce a novel and simple method for obtaining high-quality text embeddings using only synthetic data and less than 1k training steps. Unlike existing methods that often depend on multi-stage intermediate pre-training with billions of weakly-supervised text pairs, followed by fine-tuning with a few labeled datasets, our method does not require building complex training pipelines or relying on manually collected datasets that are often constrained by task diversity and language coverage. We leverage proprietary LLMs to generate diverse synthetic data for hundreds of thousands of text embedding tasks across 93 languages. We then fine-tune open-source decoder-only LLMs on the synthetic data using standard contrastive loss. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong performance on highly competitive text embedding benchmarks without using any labeled data. Furthermore, when fine-tuned with a mixture of synthetic and labeled data, our model sets new state-of-the-art results on the BEIR and MTEB benchmarks.",
    "Improving the Quality of IWLST 2024 Cascade Offline Speech Translation and Speech-to-Speech Translation via Translation Hypothesis Ensembling with NMT models and Large Language Models": "This paper presents HW-TSC's submission to the IWSLT 2024 Offline Speech Translation Task and Speech-to-Speech Translation Task. The former includes three translation directions: English to German, English to Chinese, and English to Japanese, while the latter only includes the translation direction of English to Chinese. We attend all three tracks (Constraint training, Constrained with Large Language Models training, and Unconstrained training) of offline speech translation task, using the cascade model architecture. Under the constrained training track, we train an ASR model from scratch, and then employ R-Drop and domain data selection to train the NMT model. In the constrained with Large Language Models training track, we use Wav2vec 2.0 and mBART50 for ASR model training initialization, and then train the LLama2-7B-based MT model using continuous training with sentence-aligned parallel data, supervised fine-tuning, and contrastive preference optimization. In the unconstrained training track, we fine-tune the whisper model for speech recognition, and then ensemble the translation results of NMT models and LLMs to produce superior translation output. For the speech-to-speech translation Task, we initially employ the offline speech translation system described above to generate the translated text. Then, we utilize the VITS model to generate the corresponding speech and employ the OpenVoice model for timbre cloning.",
    "IMS_medicALY at #SMM4H 2024: Detecting Impacts of Outdoor Spaces on Social Anxiety with Data Augmented Ensembling": "Many individuals affected by Social Anxiety Disorder turn to social media platforms to share their experiences and seek advice. This includes discussing the potential benefits of engaging with outdoor environments. As part of #SMM4H 2024, Shared Task 3 focuses on classifying the effects of outdoor spaces on social anxiety symptoms in Reddit posts. In our contribution to the task, we explore the effectiveness of domain-specific models (trained on social media data - SocBERT) against general domain models (trained on diverse datasets - BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-3.5) in predicting the sentiment related to outdoor spaces. Further, we assess the benefits of augmenting sparse human-labeled data with synthetic training instances and evaluate the complementary strengths of domain-specific and general classifiers using an ensemble model. Our results show that (1) fine-tuning small, domain-specific models generally outperforms large general language models in most cases. Only one large language model (GPT-4) exhibits performance comparable to the fine-tuned models (52% F1). Further, we find that (2) synthetic data does improve the performance of fine-tuned models in some cases, and (3) models do not appear to complement each other in our ensemble setup.",
    "In-Context Symbolic Regression: Leveraging Large Language Models for Function Discovery": "State of the art Symbolic Regression (SR) methods currently build specialized models, while the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce the first comprehensive framework that utilizes LLMs for the task of SR. We propose In-Context Symbolic Regression (ICSR), an SR method which iteratively refines a functional form with an LLM and determines its coefficients with an external optimizer. ICSR leverages LLMs' strong mathematical prior both to propose an initial set of possible functions given the observations and to refine them based on their errors. Our findings reveal that LLMs are able to successfully find symbolic equations that fit the given data, matching or outperforming the overall performance of the best SR baselines on four popular benchmarks, while yielding simpler equations with better out of distribution generalization.",
    "INCHARACTER: Evaluating Personality Fidelity in Role-Playing Agents through Psychological Interviews": "Role-playing agents (RPAs), powered by large language models, have emerged as a flourishing field of applications. However, a key challenge lies in assessing whether RPAs accurately reproduce the personas of target characters, namely their character fidelity. Existing methods mainly focus on the knowledge and linguistic patterns of characters. This paper, instead, introduces a novel perspective to evaluate the personality fidelity of RPAs with psychological scales. Overcoming drawbacks of previous self-report assessments on RPAs, we propose INCHARACTER, namely Interviewing Character agents for personality tests. Experiments include various types of RPAs and LLMs, covering 32 distinct characters on 14 widely used psychological scales. The results validate the effectiveness of INCHARACTER in measuring RPA personalities. Then, with INCHARACTER, we show that state-of-the-art RPAs exhibit personalities highly aligned with the human-perceived personalities of the characters, achieving an accuracy up to 80.7%.",
    "Incorporating Syntax and Lexical Knowledge to Multilingual Sentiment Classification on Large Language Models": "This paper exploits a sentiment extractor supported by syntactic and lexical resources to enhance multilingual sentiment classification solved through the generative approach, without retraining LLMs. By adding external information of words and phrases that have positive/negative polarities, the multilingual sentiment classification error was reduced by up to 33 points, and the combination of two approaches performed best especially in high-performing pairs of LLMs and languages.",
    "Incremental pre-training from smaller language models": "Large language models have recently become a new learning paradigm and led to state-of-the-art performance across a range of tasks. As explosive open-source pre-trained models are available, it is worth investigating how to better utilize existing models. We propose a simple yet effective method, Incr-Pretrain, for incrementally pre-training language models from smaller well-trained source models. Different layer-wise transfer strategies were introduced for model augmentation including parameter copying, initial value padding, and model distillation. Experiments on multiple zero-shot learning tasks demonstrate satisfying inference performance upon transferring and promising training efficiency during continuing pre-training. Compared to training from scratch, Incr-Pretrain can save up to half the training time to get a similar testing loss.",
    "INDICGENBENCH: A Multilingual Benchmark to Evaluate Generation Capabilities of LLMs on Indic Languages": "As large language models (LLMs) see increasing adoption across the globe, it is imperative for LLMs to be representative of the linguistic diversity of the world. India is a linguistically diverse country of 1.4 Billion people. To facilitate research on multilingual LLM evaluation, we release INDICGENBENCH — the largest benchmark for evaluating LLMs on user-facing generation tasks across a diverse set 29 of Indic languages covering 13 scripts and 4 language families. INDICGENBENCH is composed of diverse generation tasks like cross-lingual summarization, machine translation, and cross-lingual question answering. INDICGENBENCH extends existing benchmarks to many Indic languages through human curation providing multi-way parallel evaluation data for many under-represented Indic languages for the first time. We evaluate a wide range of proprietary and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM-2, mT5, Gemma, BLOOM and LLaMA on INDICGENBENCH in a variety of settings. The largest PaLM-2 models performs the best on most tasks, however, there is a significant performance gap in all languages compared to English showing that further research is needed for the development of more inclusive multilingual language models. INDICGENBENCH is available at www.github.com/google-research-datasets/indic-gen-bench",
    "INDICLLMSUITE: A Blueprint for Creating Pre-training and Fine-Tuning Datasets for Indian Languages": "Despite the considerable advancements in English LLMs, the progress in building comparable models for other languages has been hindered due to the scarcity of tailored resources. Our work aims to bridge this divide by introducing an expansive suite of resources specifically designed for the development of Indic LLMs, covering 22 languages, containing a total of 251B tokens and 74.8M instruction-response pairs. Recognizing the importance of both data quality and quantity, our approach combines highly curated manually verified data, unverified yet valuable data, and synthetic data. We build a clean, open-source pipeline for curating pre-training data from diverse sources, including websites, PDFs, and videos, incorporating best practices for crawling, cleaning, flagging, and deduplication. For instruction-fine tuning, we amalgamate existing Indic datasets, translate/transliterate English datasets into Indian languages, and utilize LLaMa2 and Mixtral models to create conversations grounded in articles from Indian Wikipedia and Wikihow. Additionally, we address toxicity alignment by generating toxic prompts for multiple scenarios and then generate non-toxic responses by feeding these toxic prompts to an aligned LLaMa2 model. We hope that the datasets, tools, and resources released as a part of this work will not only propel the research and development of Indic LLMs but also establish an open-source blueprint for extending such efforts to other languages. The data and other artifacts created as part of this work are released with permissive licenses at https://github.com/AI4Bharat/IndicLLMSuite.",
    "Inference to the Best Explanation in Large Language Models": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have found success in real-world applications, their underlying explanatory process is still poorly understood. This paper proposes IBE-Eval, a framework inspired by philosophical accounts on Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE) to advance the interpretation and evaluation of LLM explanations. IBE-Eval estimates the plausibility of natural language explanations through a combination of explicit logical and linguistic features including: consistency, parsimony, coherence, and uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on Causal Question Answering (CQA), where IBE-Eval is tasked to select the most plausible causal explanation amongst competing ones generated by the LLM (e.g. GPT 3.5 or LLaMA 2). The experiments reveal that IBE-Eval can successfully identify the best explanation with up to 77% accuracy (≈27% above random), improving upon a GPT 3.5-as-a-judge baseline (≈+17%) while being intrinsically more efficient and interpretable. Additional analysis suggests that, despite LLM-specific variances, generated explanations tend to conform to IBE criteria and that IBE-Eval is significantly correlated with human judgment, opening up opportunities for future development of automated explanation verification tools.",

InfiMM, inspired by the Flamingo architecture, distinguishes itself through the utilization of large-scale training data, three-stage training strategies, and diverse large language models. This approach ensures the preservation of Flamingo's foundational strengths while simultaneously introducing augmented capabilities. Empirical evaluations across a variety of benchmarks underscore InfiMM's remarkable capability in multimodal understanding.",
    "INFOBENCH: Evaluating Instruction Following Ability in Large Language Models": "This paper introduces the Decomposed Requirements Following Ratio (DRFR), a new metric for evaluating Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to follow instructions. Addressing a gap in current methodologies, DRFR breaks down complex instructions into simpler criteria, facilitating a detailed analysis of LLMs' compliance with various aspects of tasks. Alongside this metric, we present INFOBENCH, a benchmark comprising 500 diverse instructions and 2,250 decomposed questions across multiple constraint categories. Our experiments compare DRFR with traditional scoring methods and explore annotation sources, including human experts, crowd-sourced workers, and GPT-4. The findings demonstrate DRFR's higher reliability and the effectiveness of using GPT-4 as a cost-efficient annotator. The evaluation of several advanced LLMs using this framework reveals their strengths and areas needing improvement, particularly in complex instruction-following. This study contributes a novel metric and benchmark, offering insights for future LLM development and evaluation.",
    "INFOLOSSQA: Characterizing and Recovering Information Loss in Text Simplification": "Text simplification aims to make technical texts more accessible to laypeople but often results in deletion of information and vagueness. This work proposes INFOLOSSQA, a framework to characterize and recover simplification-induced information loss in form of question-and-answer (QA) pairs. Building on the theory of Questions Under Discussion, the QA pairs are designed to help readers deepen their knowledge of a text. First, we collect a dataset of 1,000 linguist-curated QA pairs derived from 104 LLM simplifications of English medical study abstracts. Our analyses of this data reveal that information loss occurs frequently, and that the QA pairs give a high-level overview of what information was lost. Second, we devise two methods for this task: end-to-end prompting of open-source and commercial language models, and a natural language inference pipeline. With a novel evaluation framework considering the correctness of QA pairs and their linguistic suitability, our expert evaluation reveals that models struggle to reliably identify information loss and applying similar standards as humans at what constitutes information loss.",
    "Informing climate risk analysis using textual information - A research agenda": "We present a research agenda focused on efficiently extracting, assuring quality, and consolidating textual company sustainability information to address urgent climate change decision-making needs. Starting from the goal to create integrated FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) climate-related data, we identify research needs pertaining to the technical aspects of information extraction as well as to the design of the integrated sustainability datasets that we seek to compile. Regarding extraction, we leverage technological advancements, particularly in large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, to unlock the underutilized potential of unstructured textual information contained in corporate sustainability reports. In applying these techniques, we review key challenges, which include the retrieval and extraction of CO2 emission values from PDF documents, especially from unstructured tables and graphs therein, and the validation of automatically extracted data through comparisons with human-annotated values. We also review how existing use cases and practices in climate risk analytics relate to choices of what textual information should be extracted and how it could be linked to existing structured data.",
    "INJECAGENT: Benchmarking Indirect Prompt Injections in Tool-Integrated Large Language Model Agents": "Recent work has embodied LLMs as agents, allowing them to access tools, perform actions, and interact with external content (e.g., emails or websites). However, external content introduces the risk of indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious instructions are embedded within the content processed by LLMs, aiming to manipulate these agents into executing detrimental actions against users. Given the potentially severe consequences of such attacks, establishing benchmarks to assess and mitigate these risks is imperative.  In this work, we introduce INJECAGENT, a benchmark designed to assess the vulnerability of tool-integrated LLM agents to IPI attacks. INJECAGENT comprises 1,054 test cases covering 17 different user tools and 62 attacker tools. We categorize attack intentions into two primary types: direct harm to users and exfiltration of private data. We evaluate 30 different LLM agents and show that agents are vulnerable to IPI attacks, with ReAct-prompted GPT-4 vulnerable to attacks 24% of the time. Further investigation into an enhanced setting, where the attacker instructions are reinforced with a hacking prompt, shows additional increases in success rates, nearly doubling the attack success rate on the ReAct-prompted GPT-4. Our findings raise questions about the widespread deployment of LLM Agents.",
    "Injecting Salesperson's Dialogue Strategies in Large Language Models with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning": "Recent research in dialogue systems focuses on two main categories: task-oriented (TOD) and open-domain (chit-chat) dialogues. TOD systems help users complete specific tasks, while open-domain systems aim to create engaging conversations. However, user intents often emerge during interactions. A recent study introduced SalesBot, simulating dialogues that transition from chit-chat to task-oriented scenarios to train sales agents. Unfortunately, the initial data lacked smooth transitions and coherent long dialogues, resulting in unnatural interactions. This paper presents SalesBot 2.0, an improved dataset leveraging common-sense knowledge from large language models (LLMs) through strategic prompting. Additionally, we introduce SALESAGENT, a novel model trained on salesperson interactions using chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This model excels in transitioning topics, understanding user intents, and selecting appropriate strategies. Experiments with diverse user simulations validate our method's effectiveness in controlling dialogue strategies in LLMs. SalesBot 2.0 enhances coherence and reduces aggression, improving model learning for sales-customer interactions.",
    "Instances Need More Care: Rewriting Prompts for Instances with LLMs in the Loop Yields Better Zero-Shot Performance": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized zero-shot task performance, mitigating the need for task-specific annotations while enhancing task generalizability. Despite its advancements, current methods using trigger phrases such as “Let's think step by step” remain limited. This study introduces PROMPTED, an approach that optimizes the zero-shot prompts for individual task instances following an innovative manner of “LLMs in the loop”. Our comprehensive evaluation across 13 datasets and 10 task types based on GPT-4 reveals that PROMPTED significantly outperforms both the naive zero-shot approaches and a strong baseline (i.e., “Output Refinement”) which refines the task output instead of the input prompt. Our experimental results also confirmed the generalization of this advantage to the relatively weaker GPT-3.5. Even more intriguingly, we found that leveraging GPT-3.5 to rewrite prompts for the stronger GPT-4 not only matches but occasionally exceeds the efficacy of using GPT-4 as the prompt rewriter. Our research thus presents a huge value in not only enhancing zero-shot LLM performance but also potentially enabling supervising LLMs with their weaker counterparts, a capability attracting much interest recently. Finally, our additional experiments confirm the generalization of the advantages to open-source LLMs such as Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B.",
    "Instruct Once, Chat Consistently in Multiple Rounds: An Efficient Tuning Framework for Dialogue": "Tuning language models for dialogue generation has been a prevalent paradigm for building capable dialogue agents. Yet, traditional tuning narrowly views dialogue generation as resembling other language generation tasks, ignoring the role disparities between two speakers and the multi-round interactive process that dialogues ought to be. Such a manner often leads to unsatisfactory chat consistency for the built agent. In this work, we emphasize the interactive, communicative nature of dialogue and argue that it is more feasible to model the speaker roles of agent and user separately, enabling the agent to adhere to its role consistently. With this in mind, we propose an efficient Multi-round Interactive Dialogue Tuning (MIDI-Tuning) framework. It models the agent and user individually with two adapters built upon large language models. The adapters make use of respective utterances round by round in alternating order and they are tuned via a round-level memory caching mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework performs superior to traditional fine-tuning and harbors the tremendous potential for improving dialogue consistency.",
    "InstructCMP: Length Control in Sentence Compression through Instruction-based Large Language Models": "Extractive summarization can produce faithful summaries but often requires additional constraints such as a desired summary length. Traditional sentence compression models do not typically consider the constraints because of their restricted model abilities, which require model modifications for coping with them. To bridge this gap, we propose Instruction-based Compression (InstructCMP), an approach to the sentence compression task that can consider the length constraint through instructions by leveraging the zero-shot task-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). For this purpose, we created new evaluation datasets by transforming traditional sentence compression datasets into an instruction format. By using the datasets, we first reveal that the current LLMs still face challenges in accurately controlling the length for a compressed text. To address this issue, we propose an approach named “length priming,” that incorporates additional length information into the instructions without external resources. While the length priming effectively works in a zero-shot setting, a training dataset with the instructions would further improve the ability of length control. Thus, we additionally created a training dataset in an instruction format to fine-tune the model on it. Experimental results and analysis show that applying the length priming significantly improves performances of InstructCMP in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings without the need of any model modifications.",
    "InstructCoder: Instruction Tuning Large Language Models for Code Editing": "Code editing encompasses a variety of pragmatic tasks that developers deal with daily. Despite its relevance and practical usefulness, automatic code editing remains an underexplored area in the evolution of deep learning models, partly due to data scarcity. In this work, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to edit code based on user instructions. Evaluated on a novel human-written execution-based benchmark dubbed EditEval, we found current models often struggle to fulfill the instructions. In light of this, we contribute InstructCoder, the first instruction-tuning dataset designed to adapt LLMs for general-purpose code editing, containing high-diversity code-editing tasks such as comment insertion, code optimization, and code refactoring. It consists of over 114,000 instruction-input-output triplets and covers multiple distinct code editing scenarios. The collection process starts with filtered commit data sourced from GitHub Python repositories as seeds. Subsequently, the dataset is systematically expanded through an iterative process, where both seed and generated tasks are used to prompt ChatGPT for more data. Our findings reveal that open-source LLMs fine-tuned on InstructCoder can significantly enhance the accuracy of code edits, exhibiting superior code-editing performance matching advanced proprietary LLMs.",
    "InstructEd: Soft-Instruction Tuning for Model Editing with Hops": "The task of model editing becomes popular for correcting inaccurate or outdated parametric knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there are major limitations of state of the art (SOTA) model editing methods, including the excessive memorization issue caused by the direct editing methods, as well as the error propagation and knowledge conflict issues from the memory enhancement methods, resulting in hindering models' portability, e.g., the ability to transfer the new knowledge to related one-hop or multi-hop content. To address these issues, we propose the InstructEd method, the idea of which is to insert soft instructions into the attention module so as to facilitate interactions between instructions and questions and to understand and utilize new facts. Our main findings are: (i) InstructEd has achieved SOTA performance on three datasets for one-hop/multi-hop evaluation with LLaMAs and GPT2, achieving 10% (5%) improvement in one-hop (multi-hop) model editing. (ii) Different from earlier methods on editing parameters in FFN, we show that editing attention can also help. (iii) Model editing is highly related to retrieval augmented methods, which can help improve the locality of model editing while slightly decrease the editing performance with hops. Our code is available at https://github.com/sev777/InstructED.",
    "InstructEval: Instruction-Tuned Text Evaluator from Human Preference": "This paper explores to construct a general text evaluator based on open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), a domain predominantly occupied by commercial counterparts such as GPT-4. Recognizing the limitations of open-source models like Llama in evaluative tasks, we introduce InstructEval, a general multi-aspect text evaluator developed through instruction tuning of open-source LLMs. To overcome the shortage of annotated resources for multi-aspect evaluations, InstructEval combines extensive open Human Preference Modeling (HPM) datasets with a small set of multi-aspect annotated data. This approach not only enhances effectiveness in overall evaluation tasks but also exhibits improved performance in multi-aspect evaluation tasks. As demonstrated by our extensive experiments, InstructEval achieves comparable or superior performance to commercial LLMs like ChatGPT or GPT-4 in terms of both overall and multi-aspect evaluation.",
    "InstructGraph: Boosting Large Language Models via Graph-centric Instruction Tuning and Preference Alignment": "Do current large language models (LLMs) better solve graph reasoning and generation tasks with parameter updates? In this paper, we propose InstructGraph, a framework that empowers LLMs with the abilities of graph reasoning and generation by instruction tuning and preference alignment. Specifically, we first propose a structured format verbalizer to unify all graph data into a universal code-like format, which can simply represent the graph without any external graph-specific encoders. Furthermore, a graph instruction tuning stage is introduced to guide LLMs in solving graph reasoning and generation tasks. Finally, we identify potential hallucination problems in graph tasks and sample negative instances for preference alignment, the target of which is to enhance the output's reliability of the model. Extensive experiments across multiple graph-centric tasks exhibit that InstructGraph can achieve the best performance and outperform GPT-4 and LLaMA2 by more than 13% and 38%, respectively.",
    "Instruction Fusion: Advancing Prompt Evolution through Hybridization": "The fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) specialized in code generation has seen notable advancements through the use of open-domain coding queries. Despite the successes, existing methodologies like Evol-Instruct encounter performance limitations, impeding further enhancements in code generation tasks. This paper examines the constraints of existing prompt evolution techniques and introduces a novel approach, Instruction Fusion (IF). IF innovatively combines two distinct prompts through a hybridization process, thereby enhancing the evolution of training prompts for code LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed novel method effectively addresses the shortcomings of prior methods, significantly improving the performance of Code LLMs across five code generation benchmarks, namely HumanEval, HumanEval+, MBPP, MBPP+ and MultiPL-E, which underscore the effectiveness of Instruction Fusion in advancing the capabilities of LLMs in code generation.",
    "Instruction Position Matters in Sequence Generation with Large Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) are capable of performing conditional sequence generation tasks, such as translation or summarization, through instruction fine-tuning. The fine-tuning data is generally a sequential concatenation of a specific task instruction, an input sentence, and the corresponding response. Considering the locality of self-attention modeling in LLMs, these models face the risk of instruction forgetting when generating responses for long input sentences. To mitigate this issue, we propose to enhance the instruction-following capability of LLMs by relocating the position of task instructions after the input sentences. Theoretical analysis suggests that our straightforward method can alter the model's learning focus, thereby emphasizing the training of instruction-following capabilities. Concurrently, experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms traditional settings across various model scales (1B / 7B / 13B) and different sequence generation tasks (translation and summarization), without any additional data or annotation costs. Notably, our method significantly improves the zero-shot performance on conditional sequence generation, e.g., up to 9.7 BLEU points on WMT zero-shot translation tasks. Further analysis reveals that our method can substantially enhance the model's instruction-following ability by 1x compared to the traditional approach.",
    "Instruction Tuning with Retrieval-based Examples Ranking for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis": "Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) identifies sentiment information related to specific aspects and provides deeper market insights to businesses and organizations. With the emergence of large language models (LMs), recent studies have proposed using fixed examples for instruction tuning to reformulate ABSA as a generation task. However, the performance is sensitive to the selection of in-context examples; several retrieval methods are based on surface similarity and are independent of the LM generative objective. This study proposes an instruction learning method with retrieval-based example ranking for ABSA tasks. For each target sample, an LM was applied as a scorer to estimate the likelihood of the output given the input and a candidate example as the prompt, and training examples were labeled as positive or negative by ranking the scores. An alternating training schema is proposed to train both the retriever and LM. Instructional prompts can be constructed using high-quality examples. The LM is used for both scoring and inference, improving the generation efficiency without incurring additional computational costs or training difficulties. Extensive experiments on three ABSA subtasks verified the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its superiority over various strong baseline models. Code and data are released at https://github.com/zgMin/IT-RER-ABSA.",
    "Instruction-Aware Prompt Tuning for Large Language Models": "Soft prompt tuning is a widely studied parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, it has a clear drawback: many soft tokens must be inserted into the input sequences to guarantee downstream performance. As a result, soft prompt tuning is less considered than Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) in the large language modeling (LLM) era. In this work, we propose a novel prompt tuning method, Instruction-Aware Prompt Tuning (IAPT), that requires only four soft tokens. First, we install a parameter-efficient soft prompt generator at each Transformer layer to generate idiosyncratic soft prompts for each input instruction. The generated soft prompts can be seen as a semantic summary of the input instructions and can effectively guide the output generation. Second, the soft prompt generators are modules with a bottleneck architecture consisting of a self-attention pooling operation, two linear projections, and an activation function. Pilot experiments show that prompt generators at different Transformer layers require different activation functions. Thus, we propose to learn the idiosyncratic activation functions for prompt generators automatically with the help of rational functions. We have conducted experiments on various tasks, and the experimental results demonstrate that (a) our IAPT method can outperform the recent baselines with comparable tunable parameters. (b) Our IAPT method is more efficient than LoRA under the single-backbone multi-tenant setting.",
    "Instruction-tuned Language Models are Better Knowledge Learners": "In order for large language model (LLM)-based assistants to effectively adapt to evolving information needs, it must be possible to update their factual knowledge through continued training on new data. The standard recipe for doing so involves continued pre-training on new documents followed by instruction-tuning on question-answer (QA) pairs. However, we find that LLMs trained with this recipe struggle to answer questions, even though the perplexity of documents is minimized. We found that QA pairs are generally straightforward, while documents are more complex, weaving many factual statements together in an intricate manner. Therefore, we hypothesize that it is beneficial to expose LLMs to QA pairs before continued pre-training on documents so that the process of encoding knowledge from complex documents takes into account how this knowledge is accessed through questions. Based on this, we propose pre-instruction-tuning (PIT), a method that instruction-tunes on questions prior to training on documents. This contrasts with standard instruction-tuning, which learns how to extract knowledge after training on documents. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that PIT significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to absorb knowledge from new documents, outperforming standard instruction-tuning by 17.8%.",
    "InstructProtein: Aligning Human and Protein Language via Knowledge Instruction": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, but they fall short in comprehending biological sequences such as proteins. To address this challenge, we propose InstructProtein, an innovative LLM that possesses bidirectional generation capabilities in both human and protein languages: (i) taking a protein sequence as input to predict its textual function description and (ii) using natural language to prompt protein sequence generation. To achieve this, we first pre-train an LLM on both protein and natural language corpora, enabling it to comprehend individual languages. Then supervised instruction tuning is employed to facilitate the alignment of these two distinct languages. Herein, we introduce a knowledge graph-based instruction generation framework to construct a high-quality instruction dataset, addressing the annotation imbalance and the absence of instructional signals in the existing protein-text corpus. In particular, the instructions inherit the structural relations between proteins and annotations in knowledge graphs, which empowers our model to engage in the causal modeling of protein functions, akin to the chain-of-thought processes in natural languages. Extensive experiments on bidirectional protein-text generation tasks show that InstructProtein outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs by a large margin.",
    "IntactKV: Improving Large Language Model Quantization by Keeping Pivot Tokens Intact": "Large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language processing but demand intensive computation. To mitigate this, various quantization methods have been explored, yet they compromise LLM performance. This paper unveils a previously overlooked type of outliers in LLMs. Such outliers are found to allocate most of the attention scores on initial tokens of input, termed as pivot tokens, which are crucial to the performance of quantized LLMs. Given that, we propose IntactKV to generate the KV cache of pivot tokens losslessly from the full-precision model. The approach is simple and easy to combine with existing quantization solutions with no extra inference overhead. Besides, INTACTKV can be calibrated as additional LLM parameters to boost the quantized LLMs further with minimal training costs. Mathematical analysis also proves that INTACTKV effectively reduces the upper bound of quantization error. Empirical results show that INTACTKV brings consistent improvement over various quantization methods across different LLMs and downstream tasks, leading to the new state-of-the-art for LLM quantization. The codes are available at https://github.com/ruikangliu/IntactKV.",
    "Integrate the Essence and Eliminate the Dross: Fine-Grained Self-Consistency for Free-Form Language Generation": "Self-consistency (SC), leveraging multiple samples from LLMs, shows significant gains on various reasoning tasks but struggles with free-form generation due to the difficulty of aggregating answers. Its variants, UCS and USC, rely on sample selection or voting mechanisms to improve output quality. These methods, however, face limitations due to their inability to fully utilize the nuanced consensus knowledge present within multiple candidate samples, often resulting in suboptimal outputs. We propose Fine-Grained Self-Consistency (FSC) to address these limitations by extracting and integrating segment-level commonalities from candidate samples, enhancing the performance of LLMs both in open-ended and reasoning tasks. Based on this, we present two additional strategies: candidate filtering, which enhances overall quality by identifying highly similar candidate sets, and merging, which reduces input token requirements by combining similar samples. The effectiveness of FSC is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various tasks, including summarization, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, using GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. The results indicate significant improvements over baseline methods, showcasing the potential of FSC to optimize output quality by effectively synthesizing fine-grained consensus knowledge from multiple samples.",
    "Integrating Physician Diagnostic Logic into Large Language Models: Preference Learning from Process Feedback": "The utilization of large language models for medical dialogue generation has attracted considerable attention due to its potential to enhance response richness and coherence. While previous studies have made strides in optimizing model performance, there is a pressing need to bolster the model's capacity for diagnostic logic to ensure patient safety. In response to this need, we propose an approach termed preference learning from process feedback (PLPF), which involves integrating the doctor's diagnostic logic into LLMs. PLPF encompasses three key components: rule modeling, preference data generation, and preference alignment. These components collectively serve to train the model to adhere to the diagnostic process. Our experimental results, utilizing Standardized Patient Testing, demonstrate that PLPF enhances the diagnostic accuracy of the baseline model in medical conversations by 17.6%, surpassing the performance of traditional approaches. Moreover, PLPF exhibits effectiveness in both multi-round and single-round dialogue tasks, thereby highlighting its potential in improving medical dialogue generation. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/Chengfeng-Dou/SpTesting",
    "Integrating Pre-Trained Speech and Language Models for End-to-End Speech Recognition": "Advances in machine learning have made it possible to perform various text and speech processing tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), in an end-to-end (E2E) manner. E2E approaches utilizing pre-trained models are gaining attention for conserving training data and resources. However, most of their applications in ASR involve only one of either a pre-trained speech or a language model. This paper proposes integrating a pre-trained speech representation model and a large language model (LLM) for E2E ASR. The proposed model enables the optimization of the entire ASR process, including acoustic feature extraction and acoustic and language modeling, by combining pre-trained models with a bridge network and also enables the application of remarkable developments in LLM utilization, such as parameter-efficient domain adaptation and inference optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a performance comparable to that of modern E2E ASR models by utilizing powerful pre-training models with the proposed integrated approach.",
    "Integrating Table Representations into Large Language Models for Improved Scholarly Document Comprehension": "We address the challenge of interpreting and reasoning over scientific tables with Large Language Models (LLMs), a crucial aspect of scholarly documents. Despite significant progress in natural language processing, the integration of tabular data into scientific LLMs remains limited. We propose an innovative approach leveraging intermediate task pre-training on table question-answering datasets, followed by model adaptation to comprehend tables in computer science literature. Our findings reveal that incorporating table understanding substantially improves the performance of LLMs on scientific literature understanding tasks, which we showcase in peer-review score prediction. This improvement underscores the importance of utilizing tabular data in the training of scientific language models. The code and models are publicly available.",
    "Interactive Text-to-Image Retrieval with Large Language Models: A Plug-and-Play Approach": "In this paper, we primarily address the issue of dialogue-form context query within the interactive text-to-image retrieval task. Our methodology, PlugIR, actively utilizes the general instruction-following capability of LLMs in two ways. First, by reformulating the dialogue-form context, we eliminate the necessity of fine-tuning a retrieval model on existing visual dialogue data, thereby enabling the use of any arbitrary black-box model. Second, we construct the LLM questioner to generate non-redundant questions about the attributes of the target image, based on the information of retrieval candidate images in the current context. This approach mitigates the issues of noisiness and redundancy in the generated questions. Beyond our methodology, we propose a novel evaluation metric, Best log Rank Integral (BRI), for a comprehensive assessment of the interactive retrieval system. PlugIR demonstrates superior performance compared to both zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines in various benchmarks. Additionally, the two methodologies comprising PlugIR can be flexibly applied together or separately in various situations. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Saehyung-Lee/PlugIR.",
    "Interactive-KBQA: Multi-Turn Interactions for Knowledge Base Question Answering with Large Language Models": "This study explores the realm of knowledge base question answering (KBQA). KBQA is considered a challenging task, particularly in parsing intricate questions into executable logical forms. Traditional semantic parsing (SP)-based methods require extensive data annotations, which result in significant costs. Recently, the advent of few-shot in-context learning, powered by large language models (LLMs), has showcased promising capabilities. However, fully leveraging LLMs to parse questions into logical forms in low-resource scenarios poses a substantial challenge. To tackle these hurdles, we introduce Interactive-KBQA, a framework designed to generate logical forms through direct interaction with knowledge bases (KBs). Within this framework, we have developed three generic APIs for KB interaction. For each category of complex question, we devised exemplars to guide LLMs through the reasoning processes. Our method achieves competitive results on the WebQuestionsSP, ComplexWebQuestions, KQA Pro, and MetaQA datasets with a minimal number of examples (shots). Importantly, our approach supports manual intervention, allowing for the iterative refinement of LLM outputs. By annotating a dataset with step-wise reasoning processes, we showcase our model's adaptability and highlight its potential for contributing significant enhancements to the field.",
    "Interpretability of Language Models via Task Spaces": "The usual way to interpret language models (LMs) is to test their performance on different benchmarks and subsequently infer their internal processes. In this paper, we present an alternative approach, concentrating on the quality of LM processing, with a focus on their language abilities. To this end, we construct 'linguistic task spaces' - representations of an LM's language conceptualisation - that shed light on the connections LMs draw between language phenomena. Task spaces are based on the interactions of the learning signals from different linguistic phenomena, which we assess via a method we call 'similarity probing'. To disentangle the learning signals of linguistic phenomena, we further introduce a method called 'fine-tuning via gradient differentials' (FTGD). We apply our methods to language models of three different scales and find that larger models generalise better to overarching general concepts for linguistic tasks, making better use of their shared structure. Further, the distributedness of linguistic processing increases with pre-training through increased parameter sharing between related linguistic tasks. The overall generalisation patterns are mostly stable throughout training and not marked by incisive stages, potentially explaining the lack of successful curriculum strategies for LMs.",
    "Interpretable User Satisfaction Estimation for Conversational Systems with Large Language Models": "Accurate and interpretable user satisfaction estimation (USE) is critical for understanding, evaluating, and continuously improving conversational systems. Users express their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with diverse conversational patterns in both general-purpose (ChatGPT and Bing Copilot) and task-oriented (customer service chatbot) conversational systems. Existing approaches based on featurized ML models or text embeddings fall short in extracting generalizable patterns and are hard to interpret. In this work, we show that LLMs can extract interpretable signals of user satisfaction from their natural language utterances more effectively than embedding-based approaches. Moreover, an LLM can be tailored for USE via an iterative prompting framework using supervision from labeled examples. Our proposed method, Supervised Prompting for User satisfaction Rubrics (SPUR), not only has higher accuracy but is more interpretable as it scores user satisfaction via learned rubrics with a detailed breakdown.",
    "InterrogateLLM: Zero-Resource Hallucination Detection in LLM-Generated Answers": "Despite the many advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their unprecedented rapid evolution, their impact and integration into every facet of our daily lives is limited due to various reasons. One critical factor hindering their widespread adoption is the occurrence of hallucinations, where LLMs invent answers that sound realistic, yet drift away from factual truth. In this paper, we present a novel method for detecting hallucinations in large language models, which tackles a critical issue in the adoption of these models in various real-world scenarios. Through extensive evaluations across multiple datasets and LLMs, including Llama-2, we study the hallucination levels of various recent LLMs and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to automatically detect them. Notably, we observe up to 87% hallucinations for Llama-2 in a specific experiment, where our method achieves a Balanced Accuracy of 81%, all without relying on external knowledge.",
    "INTERS: Unlocking the Power of Large Language Models in Search with Instruction Tuning": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various natural language processing tasks. Despite this, their application to information retrieval (IR) tasks is still challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of many IR-specific concepts in natural language. While prompt-based methods can provide task descriptions to LLMs, they often fall short in facilitating a comprehensive understanding and execution of IR tasks, thereby limiting LLMs' applicability. To address this gap, in this work, we explore the potential of instruction tuning to enhance LLMs' proficiency in IR tasks. We introduce a novel instruction tuning dataset, INTERS, encompassing 20 tasks across three fundamental IR categories: query understanding, document understanding, and query-document relationship understanding. The data are derived from 43 distinct datasets with manually written templates. Our empirical results reveal that INTERS significantly boosts the performance of various publicly available LLMs, such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Falcon, in IR tasks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of instruction design, template diversity, few-shot demonstrations, and the volume of instructions on performance. We make our dataset and the fine-tuned models publicly accessible at https://github.com/DaoD/INTERS.",
    "INTERVENOR: Prompting the Coding Ability of Large Language Models with the Interactive Chain of Repair": "This paper introduces INTERVENOR (INTERactiVE chaiN Of Repair), a system designed to emulate the interactive code repair processes observed in humans, encompassing both code diagnosis and code repair. INTERVENOR prompts Large Language Models (LLMs) to play distinct roles during the code repair process, functioning as both a Code Learner and a Code Teacher. Specifically, the Code Learner is tasked with adhering to instructions to generate or repair code, while the Code Teacher is responsible for crafting a Chain-of-Repair (CoR) to serve as guidance for the Code Learner. During generating the CoR, the Code Teacher needs to check the generated codes from Code Learner and reassess how to address code bugs based on error feedback received from compilers. Experimental results demonstrate that INTERVENOR surpasses baseline models, exhibiting improvements of approximately 18% and 4.3% over GPT-3.5 in code generation and code translation tasks, respectively. Our further analyses show that CoR is effective to illuminate the reasons behind bugs and outline solution plans in natural language. With the feedback of code compilers, INTERVENOR can accurately identify syntax errors and assertion errors and provide precise instructions to repair codes.",
    "Intervention extraction in preclinical animal studies of Alzheimer's Disease: Enhancing regex performance with language model-based filtering": "We explore different information extraction tools for annotation of interventions to support automated systematic reviews of preclinical AD animal studies. We compare two PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) extraction tools and two prompting-based learning strategies based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Motivated by the high recall of a dictionary-based approach, we define a two-stage method, removing false positives obtained from regexes with a pre-trained LM. With ChatGPT-based filtering using three-shot prompting, our approach reduces almost two-thirds of False Positives compared to the dictionary approach alone, while outperforming knowledge-free instructional prompting.",
    "Into the Unknown: Generating Geospatial Descriptions for New Environments": "Similar to vision-and-language navigation (VLN) tasks that focus on bridging the gap between vision and language for embodied navigation, the new Rendezvous (RVS) task requires reasoning over allocentric spatial relationships (independent of the observer's viewpoint) using non-sequential navigation instructions and maps. However, performance substantially drops in new environments with no training data. Using opensource descriptions paired with coordinates (e.g., Wikipedia) provides training data but suffers from limited spatially-oriented text resulting in low geolocation resolution. We propose a large-scale augmentation method for generating high-quality synthetic data for new environments using readily available geospatial data. Our method constructs a grounded knowledge-graph, capturing entity relationships. Sampled entities and relations (“shop north of school”) generate navigation instructions via (i) generating numerous templates using context-free grammar (CFG) to embed specific entities and relations; (ii) feeding the entities and relation into a large language model (LLM) for instruction generation. A comprehensive evaluation on RVS showed that our approach improves the 100-meter accuracy by 45.83% on unseen environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models trained with CFG-based augmentation achieve superior performance compared with those trained with LLM-based augmentation, both in unseen and seen environments. These findings suggest that the potential advantages of explicitly structuring spatial information for text-based geospatial reasoning in previously unknown, can unlock data-scarce scenarios.",
    "Intuitive or Dependent? Investigating LLMs' Behavior Style to Conflicting Prompts": "This study investigates the behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs) when faced with conflicting prompts versus their internal memory. This will not only help to understand LLMs' decision mechanism but also benefit real-world applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Drawing on cognitive theory, we target the first scenario of decision-making styles where there is no superiority in the conflict and categorize LLMs' preference into dependent, intuitive, and rational/irrational styles. Another scenario of factual robustness considers the correctness of prompt and memory in knowledge-intensive tasks, which can also distinguish if LLMs behave rationally or irrationally in the first scenario. To quantify them, we establish a complete benchmarking framework including a dataset, a robustness evaluation pipeline, and corresponding metrics. Extensive experiments with seven LLMs reveal their varying behaviors. And, with role play intervention, we can change the styles, but different models present distinct adaptivity and upper-bound. One of our key takeaways is to optimize models or the prompts according to the identified style. For instance, RAG models with high role play adaptability may dynamically adjust the interventions according to the quality of retrieval results — being dependent to better leverage informative context; and, being intuitive when the external prompt is noisy. Our dataset can be found at https://github.com/yingjiahao14/KRE.",
    "Investigating and Mitigating the Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing in Large Vision-Language Models": "Though advanced in understanding visual information with human languages, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer from multimodal hallucinations. A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this, we propose a framework called MMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs drops by at least 31%, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported without distractions. We term this phenomenon Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing. To mitigate this, we further propose a training-free method called Residual Visual Decoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derived from the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to the visual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than 24% of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining capabilities.",
    "Investigating Cultural Alignment of Large Language Models": "The intricate relationship between language and culture has long been a subject of exploration within the realm of linguistic anthropology. Large Language Models (LLMs), promoted as repositories of collective human knowledge, raise a pivotal question: do these models genuinely encapsulate the diverse knowledge adopted by different cultures? Our study reveals that these models demonstrate greater cultural alignment along two dimensions—firstly, when prompted with the dominant language of a specific culture, and secondly, when pretrained with a refined mixture of languages employed by that culture. We quantify cultural alignment by simulating sociological surveys, comparing model responses to those of actual survey participants as references. Specifically, we replicate a survey conducted in various regions of Egypt and the United States through prompting LLMs with different pretraining data mixtures in both Arabic and English with the personas of the real respondents and the survey questions. Further analysis reveals that misalignment becomes more pronounced for underrepresented personas and for culturally sensitive topics, such as those probing social values. Finally, we introduce Anthropological Prompting, a novel method leveraging anthropological reasoning to enhance cultural alignment. Our study emphasizes the necessity for a more balanced multilingual pretraining dataset to better represent the diversity of human experience and the plurality of different cultures with many implications on the topic of cross-lingual transfer.",
    "Investigating Multi-Hop Factual Shortcuts in Knowledge Editing of Large Language Models": "Recent work has showcased the powerful capability of large language models (LLMs) in recalling knowledge and reasoning. However, the reliability of LLMs in combining these two capabilities into reasoning through multi-hop facts has not been widely explored. This paper systematically investigates the possibilities for LLMs to utilize shortcuts based on direct connections between the initial and terminal entities of multi-hop knowledge. We first explore the existence of factual shortcuts through Knowledge Neurons, revealing that: (i) the strength of factual shortcuts is highly correlated with the frequency of co-occurrence of initial and terminal entities in the pre-training corpora; (ii) few-shot prompting leverages more shortcuts in answering multi-hop questions compared to chain-of-thought prompting. Then, we analyze the risks posed by factual shortcuts from the perspective of multi-hop knowledge editing. Analysis shows that approximately 20% of the failures are attributed to shortcuts, and the initial and terminal entities in these failure instances usually have higher co-occurrences in the pre-training corpus. Finally, we propose erasing shortcut neurons to mitigate the associated risks and find that this approach significantly reduces failures in multiple-hop knowledge editing caused by shortcuts.",
    "Investigating Subtler Biases in LLMs: Ageism, Beauty, Institutional, and Nationality Bias in Generative Models": "LLMs are increasingly powerful and widely used to assist users in a variety of tasks. This use risks introducing LLM biases into consequential decisions such as job hiring, human performance evaluation, and criminal sentencing. Bias in NLP systems along the lines of gender and ethnicity has been widely studied, especially for specific stereotypes (e.g., Asians are good at math). In this paper, we investigate bias along less-studied but still consequential, dimensions, such as age and beauty, measuring subtler correlated decisions that LLMs make between social groups and unrelated positive and negative attributes. Although these subtler biases are understudied they follow people as much as gender and ethnicity do. So, we want to see whether they also follow one with LLMs. We introduce a template-generated dataset of sentence completion tasks that asks the model to select the most appropriate attribute to complete an evaluative statement about a person described as a member of a specific social group. We also reverse the completion task to select the social group based on an attribute. We report the correlations that we find for 4 cutting-edge LLMs. This dataset can be used as a benchmark to evaluate progress in more generalized biases and the templating technique can be used to expand the benchmark with minimal additional human annotation.",
    "Investigating the Impact of Data Contamination of Large Language Models in Text-to-SQL Translation": "Understanding textual description to generate code seems to be an achieved capability of instruction-following Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot scenario. However, there is a severe possibility that this translation ability may be influenced by having seen target textual descriptions and the related code. This effect is known as Data Contamination. In this study, we investigate the impact of Data Contamination on the performance of GPT-3.5 in the Text-to-SQL code-generating tasks. Hence, we introduce a novel method to detect Data Contamination in GPTs and examine GPT-3.5's Text-to-SQL performances using the known Spider Dataset and our new unfamiliar dataset Termite. Furthermore, we analyze GPT-3.5's efficacy on databases with modified information via an adversarial table disconnection (ATD) approach, complicating Text-to-SQL tasks by removing structural pieces of information from the database. Our results indicate a significant performance drop in GPT-3.5 on the unfamiliar Termite dataset, even with ATD modifications, highlighting the effect of Data Contamination on LLMs in Text-to-SQL translation tasks.",
    "In­context Mixing (ICM): Code­mixed Prompts for Multilingual LLMs": "We introduce a simple and effective prompting technique called in-context mixing (ICM) for effective in-context learning (ICL) with multilingual large language models (MLLMs). With ICM, we modify the few-shot examples within ICL prompts to be intra-sententially code-mixed by randomly swapping content words in the target languages with their English translations. We observe that ICM prompts yield superior performance in NLP tasks such as disfluency correction, grammar error correction, and text simplification that demand a close correspondence between the input and output sequences. Significant improvements are observed mainly for low-resource languages that are under-represented during the pretraining and finetuning of MLLMs. We present an extensive set of experiments to analyze when ICM is effective and what design choices contribute towards its effectiveness. ICM works consistently and significantly better than other prompting techniques across models of varying capacity such as mT0-XXL, BloomZ, and GPT-4. Code, prompts, and datasets are available here.",
    "IRCoder: Intermediate Representations Make Language Models Robust Multilingual Code Generators": "Code generation has fast become one of the most popular applications of language models (LMs). Nonetheless, research on multilingual aspects of Code-LMs, such as cross-lingual transfer between different programming languages, language-specific data augmentation, and post-hoc LM adaptation, alongside the exploitation of data sources other than the original textual content, has been much sparser than for their natural language counterparts. In particular, most mainstream Code-LMs have been pre-trained on source code files alone. In this work, we investigate the prospect of leveraging readily available compiler intermediate representations (IR)—shared across programming languages—to improve the multilingual capabilities of Code-LMs and facilitate cross-lingual transfer.  To this end, we first compile SLTrans, a parallel dataset consisting of nearly 4M self-contained source code files coupled with their respective intermediate representations. Next, starting from various base Code-LMs (ranging from 1.1B to 7.3B parameters), we carry out continued causal language modelling training on SLTrans, forcing the Code-LMs to (1) learn the IR language and (2) align the IR constructs with respective constructs of various programming languages. Our resulting models, dubbed IRCoder, display sizeable and consistent gains across various code generation tasks and metrics, including prompt robustness, multilingual code completion, code understanding, and instruction following.",
    "Irish-based Large Language Model with Extreme Low-Resource Settings in Machine Translation": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performances in a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their success does not always extend to machine translation, particularly in challenging scenarios such as translating low-resource languages. This study investigates the multilingual capability of LLMs, with a case study on Irish, an extremely low-resource language, focusing on translation tasks between English and Irish. We propose a dynamic, efficient language adaptation framework for English-centric LLMs, which involves layer-specific adjustments and subsequent fine-tuning for machine translation. Our findings highlight several key insights: (1) different layers in the LLM serve distinct functions such as language understanding and task reasoning, (2) effective translation requires extensive pre-training on both source and target languages, and (3) targeted fine-tuning for machine translation leads to significant improvements of 36.7% for English to Irish and 133.4% for Irish to English compared to the previous state-of-the-art.",
    "Is That the Right Dose? Investigating Generative Language Model Performance on Veterinary Prescription Text Analysis": "Optimizing antibiotic dosing recommendations is a vital aspect of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs aimed at combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a significant public health concern, where inappropriate dosing contributes to the selection of AMR pathogens. A key challenge is the extraction of dosing information, which is embedded in free-text clinical records and necessitates numerical transformations. This paper assesses the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in extracting essential prescription attributes such as dose, duration, active ingredient, and indication. We evaluate methods to optimize LLMs on this task against a baseline BERT-based ensemble model. Our findings reveal that LLMs can achieve exceptional accuracy by combining probabilistic predictions with deterministic calculations, enforced through functional prompting, to ensure data types and execute necessary arithmetic. This research demonstrates new prospects for automating aspects of AMS when no training data is available.",
    "Is Your Large Language Model Knowledgeable or a Choices-Only Cheater?": "Recent work shows that large language models (LLMs) can answer multiple-choice questions using only the choices, but does this mean that MCQA leaderboard rankings of LLMs are largely influenced by abilities in choices-only settings? To answer this, we use a contrast set that probes if LLMs over-rely on choices-only shortcuts in MCQA. While previous works build contrast sets via expensive human annotations or model-generated data which can be biased, we employ graph mining to extract contrast sets from existing MCQA datasets. We use our method on UnifiedQA, a group of six commonsense reasoning datasets with high choices-only accuracy, to build an 820-question contrast set. After validating our contrast set, we test 12 LLMs, finding that these models do not exhibit reliance on choice-only shortcuts when given both the question and choices. Despite the susceptibility of MCQA to high choices-only accuracy, we argue that LLMs are not obtaining high ranks on MCQA leaderboards just due to their ability to exploit choices-only shortcuts.",
    "It Is Not About What You Say, It Is About How You Say It: A Surprisingly Simple Approach for Improving Reading Comprehension": "Natural language processing has seen rapid progress over the past decade. Due to the speed of developments, some practices get established without proper evaluation. Considering one such case and focusing on reading comprehension, we ask our first research question: 1) How does the order of inputs - i.e., question and context - affect model performance? Additionally, given recent advancements in input emphasis, we ask a second research question: 2) Does emphasizing either the question, the context, or both enhance performance? Experimenting with 9 large language models across 3 datasets, we find that presenting the context before the question improves model performance, with an accuracy increase of up to 31%. Furthermore, emphasizing the context yields superior results compared to question emphasis, and in general, emphasizing parts of the input is particularly effective for addressing questions that models lack the parametric knowledge to answer. Experimenting with both prompt-based and attention-based emphasis methods, we additionally find that the best method is surprisingly simple: it only requires concatenating a few tokens to the input and results in an accuracy improvement of up to 36%, allowing smaller models to outperform their significantly larger counterparts.",
    "ITAKE: Interactive Unstructured Text Annotation and Knowledge Extraction System with LLMs and ModelOps": "Extracting structured knowledge from unstructured text data has a wide range of application prospects, and a pervasive trend is to develop text annotation tools to help extraction. However, they often encounter issues such as single scenario usage, lack of effective human-machine collaboration, insufficient model supervision, and suboptimal utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce an interactive unstructured text annotation and knowledge extraction system that synergistically integrates LLMs and ModelOps to alleviate these issues. The system leverages LLMs for enhanced performance in low-resource contexts, employs a ModelOps platform to monitor models throughout their lifecycle, and amalgamates interactive annotation methods with online machine learning and active learning. The demo video1 and website2 are now publicly available.",
    "ItD: Large Language Models Can Teach Themselves Induction through Deduction": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are showing impressive performance on a wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks, researchers have found that they still have limited ability to conduct induction. Recent works mainly adopt “post processes” paradigms to improve the performance of LLMs on induction (e.g., the hypothesis search & refinement methods), but their performance is still constrained by the inherent inductive capability of the LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Induction through Deduction (ItD), to enable the LLMs to teach themselves induction through deduction. The ItD framework is composed of two main components: a Deductive Data Generation module to generate induction data and a Naive Bayesian Induction module to optimize the fine-tuning and decoding of LLMs. Our empirical results showcase the effectiveness of ItD on two induction benchmarks, achieving relative performance improvement of 36% and 10% compared with previous state-of-the-art, respectively. Our ablation study verifies the effectiveness of two key modules of ItD. We also verify the effectiveness of ItD across different LLMs and deductors. The data and code of this paper can be found at https://github.com/forangel2014/ItD.",
    "Iterative Forward Tuning Boosts In-Context Learning in Language Models": "Despite the advancements in in-context learning (ICL) for large language models (LLMs), current research centers on specific prompt engineering, such as demonstration selection, with the expectation that a single iteration of demonstrations processing can generalize effectively to a given test sample. However, this perspective overlooks the potential benefits derived from multiple iterations involving demonstrations, a practice aligning more closely with the iterative decision-making process exhibited by humans, who often learn through analogy. In this study, we introduce a novel two-stage framework to boost ICL in LLMs. Specifically, our framework delineates the ICL process into two distinct stages: Deep-Thinking and test stages. The Deep-Thinking stage incorporates a unique attention mechanism, i.e., iterative enhanced attention, which enables multiple rounds of information accumulation. This mechanism operates by manipulating the Key-Value matrices without training, fostering enhanced understanding capabilities in LLMs by “thinking” demonstrations multiple times. We evaluated Deep-Thinking across a range of benchmarks and LLMs, showing its superior performance over vanilla ICL methods and its effectiveness in challenging tasks where demonstration selection is infeasible.",
    "Iterative Refinement of Project-Level Code Context for Precise Code Generation with Compiler Feedback": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in automated code generation. Yet, LLM-generated code may contain errors in API usage, class, data structure, or missing project-specific information. As much of this project-specific context cannot fit into the prompts of LLMs, we must find ways to allow the model to explore the project-level code context. We present COCOGEN, a new code generation approach that uses compiler feedback to improve the LLM-generated code. COCOGEN first leverages static analysis to identify mismatches between the generated code and the project's context. It then iteratively aligns and fixes the identified errors using information extracted from the code repository. We integrate COCOGEN with two representative LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo and Code Llama (13B), and apply it to Python code generation. Experimental results show that COCOGEN significantly improves the vanilla LLMs by over 80% in generating code dependent on the project context and consistently outperforms the existing retrieval-based code generation baselines.",
    "It's Not Easy Being Wrong: Large Language Models Struggle with Process of Elimination Reasoning": "Chain-of-thought (COT) prompting can help large language models (LLMs) reason toward correct answers, but its efficacy in reasoning toward incorrect answers is unexplored. This process of elimination (PoE), when used with COT, can enhance self-consistency, interpretability, and tasks such as medical diagnoses of exclusion. Thus, we propose PoE with COT, where LLMs must reason toward incorrect options on multiple-choice questions. We evaluate the ability of GPT-3.5, LLaMA-2, and Falcon to perform PoE with COT on a total of four commonsense and scientific reasoning datasets. We find that the strategy of PoE always underperforms the strategy of choosing the correct answer. The agreement of these strategies is also lower than the self-consistency of each strategy. To study these issues further, we conduct error analyses and give suggestions for future work.",
    "Ixa-Med at Discharge Me! Retrieval-Assisted Generation for Streamlining Discharge Documentation": "In this paper we present our system for the BioNLP ACL'24 Discharge Me! task on automating discharge summary section generation. Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation, we combine a Large Language Model (LLM) with external knowledge to guide the generation of the target sections. Our approach generates structured patient summaries from discharge notes using an instructed LLM, retrieves relevant Brief Hospital Course and Discharge Instructions examples via BM25 and SentenceBERT, and provides this context to a frozen LLM for generation. Our top system using SentenceBERT retrieval achieves an overall score of 0.183, outperforming zero-shot baselines. We analyze performance across different aspects, discussing limitations and future research directions.",
    "Jailbreak Open-Sourced Large Language Models via Enforced Decoding": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented performance in Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks. However, many existing studies have shown that they could be misused to generate undesired content. In response, before releasing LLMs for public access, model developers usually align those language models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). Consequently, those aligned large language models refuse to generate undesired content when facing potentially harmful/unethical requests. A natural question is “could alignment really prevent those open-sourced large language models from being misused to generate undesired content?”. In this work, we provide a negative answer to this question. In particular, we show those open-sourced, aligned large language models could be easily misguided to generate undesired content without heavy computations or careful prompt designs. Our key idea is to directly manipulate the generation process of open-sourced LLMs to misguide it to generate undesired content including harmful or biased information and even private data. We evaluate our method on 4 open-sourced LLMs accessible publicly and our finding highlights the need for more advanced mitigation strategies for open-sourced LLMs.",
    "JellyBell at TextGraphs-17 Shared Task: Fusing Large Language Models with External Knowledge for Enhanced Question Answering": "This work describes an approach to develop Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) system for TextGraphs-17 shared task. The task focuses on the fusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs). The goal is to select a KG entity (out of several candidates) which corresponds to an answer given a textual question. Our approach applies LLM to identify the correct answer among the list of possible candidates. We confirm that integrating external information is particularly beneficial when the subject entities are not well-known, and using RAG can negatively impact the performance of LLM on questions related to popular entities, as the retrieved context might be misleading. With our result, we achieved 2nd place in the post-evaluation phase.",
    "JHU IWSLT 2024 Dialectal and Low-resource System Description": "Johns Hopkins University (JHU) submitted systems for all eight language pairs in the 2024 Low-Resource Language Track. The main effort of this work revolves around fine-tuning large and publicly available models in three proposed systems: i) end-to-end speech translation (ST) fine-tuning of SEAMLESSM4T v2; ii) ST fine-tuning of Whisper; iii) a cascaded system involving automatic speech recognition with fine-tuned Whisper and machine translation with NLLB. On top of systems above, we conduct a comparative analysis of different training paradigms, such as intra-distillation of NLLB, joint training and curriculum learning of SEAMLESSM4T v2, and multi-task learning and pseudo-translation with Whisper. Our results show that the best-performing approach differs by language pairs, but that i) fine-tuned SEAMLESSM4T v2 tends to perform best for source languages on which it was pre-trained, ii) multi-task training helps Whisper fine-tuning, iii) cascaded systems with Whisper and NLLB tend to outperform Whisper alone, and iv) intra-distillation helps NLLB fine-tuning.",
    "John vs. Ahmed: Debate-Induced Bias in Multilingual LLMs": "Large language models (LLMs) play a crucial role in a wide range of real world applications. However, concerns about their safety and ethical implications are growing. While research on LLM safety is expanding, there is a noticeable gap in evaluating safety across multiple languages, especially in Arabic and Russian. We address this gap by exploring biases in LLMs across different languages and contexts, focusing on GPT-3.5 and Gemini. Through carefully designed argument-based prompts and scenarios in Arabic, English, and Russian, we examine biases in cultural, political, racial, religious, and gender domains. Our findings reveal biases in these domains. In particular, our investigation uncovers subtle biases where each model tends to present winners as those speaking the primary language the model is prompted with. Our study contributes to ongoing efforts to ensure justice and equality in LLM development and emphasizes the importance of further research towards responsible progress in this field.",
    "JORA: JAX Tensor-Parallel LoRA Library for Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning": "The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) for retrieval-based tasks, particularly in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), faces significant memory constraints, especially when fine-tuning extensive prompt sequences. Current open-source libraries support full-model inference and fine-tuning across multiple GPUs but fall short of accommodating the efficient parameter distribution required for retrieved context. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel framework for PEFT-compatible fine-tuning of GPT models, leveraging distributed training. Our framework uniquely utilizes JAX's just-in-time (JIT) compilation and tensor-sharding for efficient resource management, thereby enabling accelerated fine-tuning with reduced memory requirements. This advancement significantly improves the scalability and feasibility of fine-tuning LLMs for complex RAG applications, even on systems with limited GPU resources. Our experiments show more than 12x improvement in runtime compared to Hugging Face/DeepSpeed implementation with four GPUs while consuming less than half the VRAM per GPU.",
    "JUMPCODER: Go Beyond Autoregressive Coder via Online Modification": "While existing code large language models (code LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities in code generation, their autoregressive sequential generation inherently lacks reversibility. This limitation hinders them from timely correcting previous missing statements during coding as humans do, often leading to error propagation and suboptimal performance. We introduce JUMPCODER, a novel model-agnostic framework that enables human-like online modification and non-sequential generation to augment code LLMs. The key idea behind JUMPCODER is to insert new code into the currently generated code when necessary during generation, which is achieved through an auxiliary infilling model that works in tandem with the code LLM. Since identifying the best infill position beforehand is intractable, we adopt an infill-first, judge-later strategy, which experiments with filling at the k most critical positions following the generation of each line, and uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser alongside the Generation Model Scoring to effectively judge the validity of each potential infill. Extensive experiments using six state-of-the-art code LLMs across multiple and multilingual benchmarks consistently indicate significant improvements over all baselines. Our code is public at https://github.com/Keytoyze/JumpCoder.",
    "K-QA: A Real-World Medical Q&A Benchmark": "Ensuring the accuracy of responses provided by large language models (LLMs) is crucial, particularly in clinical settings where incorrect information may directly impact patient health. To address this challenge, we construct K-QA, a dataset containing 1,212 patient questions originating from real-world conversations held on K Health (an AI-driven clinical platform). We employ a panel of in-house physicians to answer and manually decompose a subset of K-QA into self-contained statements. Additionally, we formulate two NLI-based evaluation metrics approximating recall and precision: (1) comprehensiveness, measuring the percentage of essential clinical information in the generated answer and (2) hallucination rate, measuring the number of statements from the physician-curated response contradicted by the LLM answer. Finally, we use K-QA along with these metrics to evaluate several state-of-the-art models, as well as the effect of in-context learning and medically-oriented augmented retrieval schemes developed by the authors. Our findings indicate that in-context learning improves the comprehensiveness of the models, and augmented retrieval is effective in reducing hallucinations. We will make K-QA available to the community to spur research into medically accurate NLP applications.",
    "KEEP CHATTING! An Attractive Dataset for Continuous Conversation Agents": "Ongoing conversation is crucial for conversational agents to build long-term connections with users. However, users tend to quickly lose interest if the conversational agent's responses are not engaging enough. In this paper, we introduce a novel task aimed at increasing users' willingness to continue interacting with the agent. We create a dataset named CONTINUOUSCHAT by: (i) collecting and revising personas, then expanding them into detailed personas through experiences, daily life, future plans, or interesting stories; (ii) transforming detailed personas into dialogues infused with emotions and feelings; (iii) rewriting the dialogues in specific styles using few-shot prompts, conditioned on handwritten style-specific examples. We benchmark Large Language Models (LLMs) on the CONTINUOUSCHAT dataset using both fine-tuning and in-context learning settings. Experiments with publicly available models show that while there is substantial room for improvement in generating style-specific dialogues, our CONTINUOUSCHAT dataset is valuable for guiding conversational agents to produce more engaging dialogues and increase users' willingness to continue conversations.",
    "KG-Adapter: Enabling Knowledge Graph Integration in Large Language Models through Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning": "Although large language models (LLMs) show remarkable capabilities and generalizability across various tasks, they are criticized for lack of expertise. One promising solution is to combine knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs, and recent studies focus on integrating KGs into LLMs through prompt-based methods. However, these approaches fail to use the structural information of the KGs, suffer from the problem of knowledge conflict, and over-reliance on super LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose KG-Adapter, a parameter-level KG integration method based on parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Specifically, we introduce a novel adapter structure designed for decoder-only LLMs, which can encode KGs from both node-centered and relation-centered perspectives, and then perform joint reasoning with LLMs to generate responses end-to-end. Experiments with diverse models on four datasets for two different tasks all demonstrate significant improvements. With only 28M parameters trained, we make the 7B-parameter LLM outperform the previous full-parameter fine-tuned state-of-the-art method and comparable to the prompt-based ChatGPT methods.",
    "KG-Rank: Enhancing Large Language Models for Medical QA with Knowledge Graphs and Ranking Techniques": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative capabilities with the potential to innovate in medicine. However, the application of LLMs in real clinical settings remains challenging due to the lack of factual consistency in the generated content. In this work, we develop an augmented LLM framework, KG-Rank, which leverages a medical knowledge graph (KG) along with ranking and re-ranking techniques, to improve the factuality of long-form question answering (QA) in the medical domain. Specifically, when receiving a question, KG-Rank automatically identifies medical entities within the question and retrieves the related triples from the medical KG to gather factual information. Subsequently, KG-Rank innovatively applies multiple ranking techniques to refine the ordering of these triples, providing more relevant and precise information for LLM inference. To the best of our knowledge, KG-Rank is the first application of KG combined with ranking models in medical QA specifically for generating long answers. Evaluation on four selected medical QA datasets demonstrates that KG-Rank achieves an improvement of over 18% in ROUGE-L score. Additionally, we extend KG-Rank to open domains, including law, business, music, and history, where it realizes a 14% improvement in ROUGE-L score, indicating the effectiveness and great potential of KG-Rank.",
    "KGAST: From Knowledge Graphs to Annotated Synthetic Texts": "In recent years, the use of synthetic data, either as a complement or a substitute for original data, has emerged as a solution to challenges such as data scarcity and security risks. This paper is an initial attempt to automatically generate such data for Information Extraction tasks. We accomplished this by developing a novel synthetic data generation framework called KGAST, which leverages Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models. In our preliminary study, we conducted simple experiments to generate synthetic versions of two datasets—a French security defense dataset and an English general domain dataset, after which we evaluated them both intrinsically and extrinsically. The results indicated that synthetic data can effectively complement original data, improving the performance of models on classes with limited training samples. This highlights KGAST's potential as a tool for generating synthetic data for Information Extraction tasks.",
    "KIEval: A Knowledge-grounded Interactive Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models": "Automatic evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) are hindered by data contamination, leading to inflated assessments of their effectiveness. Existing strategies, which aim to detect contaminated texts, focus on quantifying contamination status instead of accurately gauging model performance. In this paper, we introduce KIEval, a Knowledge-grounded Interactive Evaluation framework, which incorporates an LLM-powered interactor role for the first time to accomplish a dynamic contamination-resilient evaluation. Starting with a question in a conventional LLM benchmark involving domain-specific knowledge, KIEval utilizes dynamically generated, multi-round, and knowledge-focused dialogues to determine whether a model's response is merely a recall of benchmark answers or demonstrates a deep comprehension to apply knowledge in more complex conversations. Extensive experiments on seven leading LLMs across five datasets validate KIEval's effectiveness and generalization. We also reveal that data contamination brings no contribution or even negative effect to models' real-world applicability and understanding, and existing contamination detection methods for LLMs can only identify contamination in pre-training but not during supervised fine-tuning.",
    "KIWI: A Dataset of Knowledge-Intensive Writing Instructions for Answering Research Questions": "Large language models (LLMs) adapted to follow user instructions are now widely deployed as conversational agents. In this work, we examine one increasingly common instruction-following task: providing writing assistance to compose a long-form answer. To evaluate the capabilities of current LLMs on this task, we construct KIWI, a dataset of knowledge-intensive writing instructions in the NLP research domain. Given a question, an initial model-generated answer and a set of relevant papers, an expert annotator iteratively issues instructions for the model to revise and improve its answer. We collect 1,260 interaction turns from 234 interaction sessions with three state-of-the-art LLMs. Each turn includes a user instruction, a model response, and a human evaluation of the model response. Through a detailed analysis of the collected responses, we find that all models struggle to incorporate new information into an existing answer, and to perform precise and unambiguous edits. Further, we find that models struggle to judge whether their outputs successfully followed user instructions, with accuracy at least 10 points short of human agreement. Our findings indicate that KIWI will be a valuable resource to measure progress and improve LLMs' instruction-following capabilities for knowledge intensive writing tasks.",
    "Know Thine Enemy: Adaptive Attacks on Misinformation Detection Using Reinforcement Learning": "We present XARELLO: a generator of adversarial examples for testing the robustness of text classifiers based on reinforcement learning. Our solution is adaptive, it learns from previous successes and failures in order to better adjust to the vulnerabilities of the attacked model. This reflects the behaviour of a persistent and experienced attacker, which are common in the misinformation-spreading environment. We evaluate our approach using several victim classifiers and credibility-assessment tasks, showing it generates better-quality examples with less queries, and is especially effective against the modern LLMs. We also perform a qualitative analysis to understand the language patterns in the misinformation text that play a role in the attacks.",
    "KnowCoder: Coding Structured Knowledge into LLMs for Universal Information Extraction": "In this paper, we propose KnowCoder, a Large Language Model (LLM) to conduct Universal Information Extraction (UIE) via code generation. KnowCoder aims to develop a kind of unified schema representation that LLMs can easily understand and an effective learning framework that encourages LLMs to follow schemas and extract structured knowledge accurately. To achieve these, KnowCoder introduces a code-style schema representation method to uniformly transform different schemas into Python classes, with which complex schema information, such as constraints among tasks in UIE, can be captured in an LLM-friendly manner. We further construct a code-style schema library covering over 30,000 types of knowledge, which is the largest one for UIE, to the best of our knowledge. To ease the learning process of LLMs, KnowCoder contains a two-phase learning framework that enhances its schema understanding ability via code pretraining and its schema following ability via instruction tuning. After code pretraining on around 1.5B automatically constructed data, KnowCoder already attains remarkable generalization ability and achieves relative improvements by 49.8% F1, compared to LLaMA2, under the few-shot setting. After instruction tuning, KnowCoder further exhibits strong generalization ability on unseen schemas and achieves up to 12.5% and 21.9%, compared to sota baselines, under the zero-shot setting and the low resource setting, respectively. Additionally, based on our unified schema representations, various human-annotated datasets can simultaneously be utilized to refine KnowCoder, which achieves significant improvements up to 7.5% under the supervised setting.",
    "Knowledge Acquisition through Continued Pretraining is Difficult: A Case Study on r/AskHistorians": "Powerful LLMs such as ChatGPT master a wide array of tasks, but have notable limitations in domain-specific areas, especially when prompted to recite facts. This is of particular importance for knowledge workers who are increasingly adopting LLM-based tools. While there are various techniques that can help ingest knowledge into LLMs, such as instruction tuning and alignment, most have disadvantages. We examine the impact of prominent training techniques on LLMs' knowledge accuracy using a knowledge-dense dataset that we curate from r/AskHistorians, a rich source of historical knowledge. We evaluate the impact of different model sizes from 1.3B to 7B parameters and other factors such as LoRA adapters, quantization, overfitting, and the inclusion of Reddit data in pretraining. In addition, we measure linguistic metrics and human and LLM-based preferences. Our results suggest that pretraining and model size have a much stronger effect on knowledge accuracy than continued pretraining - except in cases of overfitting to the tested knowledge. Fine-tuning on our Reddit dataset introduces less complex, but slightly more toxic language. Our study explores the challenges of injecting domain-specific datasets into LLMs and has implications for practitioners, e.g., when LLMs are to be fine-tuned with company-specific datasets.",
    "Knowledge Context Modeling with Pre-trained Language Models for Contrastive Knowledge Graph Completion": "Text-based knowledge graph completion (KGC) methods utilize pre-trained language models for triple encoding and further fine-tune the model to achieve completion. Despite their excellent performance, they neglect the knowledge context in inferring process. Intuitively, knowledge contexts, which refer to the neighboring triples around the target triples, are important information for triple inferring, since they provide additional detailed information about the entities. To this end, we propose a novel framework named KnowC, which models the knowledge context as additional prompts with pre-trained language models for knowledge graph completion. Given the substantial number of neighbors typically associated with entities, along with the constrained input token capacity of language models, we further devise several strategies to sample the neighbors. We conduct extensive experiments on common datasets FB15k-237, WN18RR and Wikidata5M, experiments show that KnowC achieves state-of-the-art performance.",
    "KNOWLEDGE CROSSWORDS: Geometric Knowledge Reasoning with Large Language Models": "We propose KNOWLEDGE CROSSWORDS, a geometric knowledge reasoning benchmark consisting of incomplete knowledge networks bounded by structured factual constraints, where LLMs are tasked with inferring the missing facts to meet all constraints. The novel setting of geometric knowledge reasoning necessitates new LM abilities beyond existing atomic/linear multi-hop QA, such as backtracking, verifying facts and constraints, reasoning with uncertainty, and more. KNOWLEDGE CROSSWORDS contains 2,101 individual problems, covering diverse knowledge domains, and is further divided into three difficulty levels. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate existing LLMs and approaches on KNOWLEDGE CROSSWORDS. Results demonstrate that baseline approaches struggle with larger knowledge networks and semantically-equivalent entity distractors. In light of their limitations, we propose two new approaches, STAGED PROMPTING and VERIFY-ALL, to augment LLMs' abilities for error-aware backtracking and constraint verification. Our VERIFY-ALL significantly outperforms prior methods and is more robust towards problems in the hard subset. Further analysis shows that geometric knowledge reasoning poses new challenges to LLMs' knowledge abilities, particularly in robustness towards varying option orders, complex structural constraints in knowledge networks, “none of the above” scenarios, and more.",
    "Knowledge Editing of Large Language Models Unconstrained by Word Order": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are considered to have potentially extensive knowledge, but because their internal processing is black-boxed, it has been difficult to directly edit the knowledge held by the LLMs themselves. To address this issue, a method called local modification-based knowledge editing has been developed. This method identifies the knowledge neurons that encode the target knowledge and adjusts the parameters associated with these neurons to update the knowledge. Knowledge neurons are identified by masking the o part from sentences representing relational triplets (s, r, o), having the LLM predict the masked part, and observing the LLM's activation during the prediction. When the architecture is decoder-based, the predicted o needs to be located at the end of the sentence. Previous local modification-based knowledge editing methods for decoder-based models have assumed SVO languages and faced challenges when applied to SOV languages such as Japanese. In this study, we propose a knowledge editing method that eliminates the need for word order constraints by converting the input for identifying knowledge neurons into a question where o is the answer. We conducted validation experiments on 500 examples and confirmed that the proposed method is effective for Japanese, a non-SVO language. We also applied this method to English, an SVO language, and demonstrated that it outperforms conventional methods.",
    "Knowledge Fusion By Evolving Weights of Language Models": "Fine-tuning pre-trained language models, particularly large language models, demands extensive computing resources and can result in varying performance outcomes across different domains and datasets. This paper examines the approach of integrating multiple models from diverse training scenarios into a unified model. This unified model excels across various data domains and exhibits the ability to generalize well on out-of-domain data. We propose a knowledge fusion method named Evolver, inspired by evolutionary algorithms, which does not need further training or additional training data. Specifically, our method involves aggregating the weights of different language models into a population and subsequently generating offspring models through mutation and crossover operations. These offspring models are then evaluated against their parents, allowing for the preservation of those models that show enhanced performance on development datasets. Importantly, our model evolving strategy can be seamlessly integrated with existing model merging frameworks, offering a versatile tool for model enhancement. Experimental results on mainstream language models (i.e., encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder) reveal that Evolver outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by large margins. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/duguodong7/model-evolution.",
    "Knowledge Graph Extraction from Total Synthesis Documents": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a powerful tool for organizing and integrating complex information, making it a suitable format for scientific knowledge. However, translating scientific knowledge into KGs is challenging as a wide variety of styles and elements to present data and ideas is used. Although efforts for KG extraction (KGE) from scientific documents exist, evaluation remains challenging and field-dependent; and existing benchmarks do not focus on scientific information. Furthermore, establishing a general benchmark for this task is challenging as not all scientific knowledge has a ground-truth KG representation, making any benchmark prone to ambiguity. Here we propose Graph of Organic Synthesis Benchmark (GOSyBench), a benchmark for KG extraction from scientific documents in chemistry, that leverages the native KG-like structure of synthetic routes in organic chemistry. We develop KG-extraction algorithms based on LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Mistral) and VLMs (GPT-4o), the best of which reaches 73% recovery accuracy and 59% precision, leaving a lot of room for improvement. We expect GOSyBench can serve as a valuable resource for evaluating and advancing KGE methods in the scientific domain, ultimately facilitating better organization, integration, and discovery of scientific knowledge.",
    "Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Large Language Models via Path Selection": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown unprecedented performance in various real-world applications. However, they are known to generate factually inaccurate outputs, a.k.a. the hallucination problem. Incorporating external knowledge extracted from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) has become a promising strategy to improve the factual accuracy of LLM-generated outputs. Nevertheless, most existing explorations rely on LLMs themselves to perform KG knowledge extraction, which is highly inflexible as LLMs can only provide binary judgment on whether a certain knowledge (e.g., a knowledge path in KG) should be used. In addition, LLMs tend to pick only knowledge with direct semantic relationship with the input text, while potentially useful knowledge with indirect semantics can be ignored. In this work, we propose a principled framework KELP with three stages to handle the above problems. Specifically, KELP is able to achieve finer granularity of flexible knowledge extraction by generating scores for knowledge paths with input texts via latent semantic matching. Meanwhile, knowledge paths with indirect semantic relationships with the input text can also be considered via trained encoding between the selected paths in KG and the input text. Experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of KELP.",
    "Knowledge of Knowledge: Exploring Known-Unknowns Uncertainty with Large Language Models": "This paper investigates the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of understanding their knowledge and uncertainty over questions. Specifically, we focus on addressing known-unknown questions, characterized by high uncertainty due to the absence of definitive answers. To facilitate our study, we collect a new dataset with Known-Unknown Questions (KUQ) and establish a categorization framework to clarify the origins of uncertainty in such queries. Subsequently, we examine the performance of open-source LLMs, fine-tuned using this dataset, in distinguishing between known and unknown queries within open-ended question-answering scenarios. The fine-tuned models demonstrated a significant improvement, achieving a considerable increase in F1-score relative to their pre-fine-tuning state. Through a comprehensive analysis, we reveal insights into the models' improved uncertainty articulation and their consequent efficacy in multi-agent debates. These findings help us understand how LLMs can be trained to identify and express uncertainty, improving our knowledge of how they understand and express complex or unclear information.",
    "Knowledge-Infused Legal Wisdom: Navigating LLM Consultation through the Lens of Diagnostics and Positive-Unlabeled Reinforcement Learning": "The integration of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications, including the legal domain, has been accelerated by their expansive and versatile nature. However, when facing a legal case, users without a legal background often struggle to formulate professional queries and may inadvertently overlook critical legal factors when presenting their case narrative to LLMs. To address this issue, we propose the Diagnostic Legal Large Language Model (D3LM), which utilizes adaptive lawyer-like diagnostic questions to collect additional case information and then provides high-quality feedback. D3LM incorporates an innovative graph-based Positive-Unlabeled Reinforcement Learning (PURL) algorithm, enabling the generation of critical questions and enhancing user-LLM interactions. Moreover, an integrated LLM-based stopping criterion facilitates precise Court Views Generation (CVG). Our research also introduces a new English-language CVG dataset based on the US case law database, enriching the realm of LLM research and deployment with a vital dimension. D3LM surpasses classical LLMs by delivering outstanding performance and a remarkable user experience in the legal domain.",
    "Knowledge-Infused Prompting: Assessing and Advancing Clinical Text Data Generation with Large Language Models": "Clinical natural language processing faces challenges like complex medical terminology and clinical contexts. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in this domain. Yet, their direct deployment can lead to privacy issues and are constrained by resources. To address this challenge, we delve into synthetic clinical text generation with LLMs for clinical NLP tasks. We propose an innovative, resource-efficient approach, CLINGEN, which infuses knowledge into the process. Our model involves clinical knowledge extraction and context-informed LLM prompting. Both clinical topics and writing styles are drawn from external domain-specific knowledge graphs and LLMs to guide data generation. Our extensive empirical study across 8 clinical NLP tasks and 18 datasets reveals that CLINGEN consistently enhances performance across various tasks by 7.7%-8.7% on average, effectively aligning the distribution of real datasets and enriching the diversity of generated training instances. Our code is available at https://github.com/ritaranx/ClinGen.",
    "Knowledge-to-SQL: Enhancing SQL Generation with Data Expert LLM": "Generating accurate SQL queries for user questions (text-to-SQL) has been a long-standing challenge since it requires a deep understanding of both the user's question and the corresponding database schema in order to retrieve the desired content accurately. Existing methods rely on the comprehensive capability of large language models (LLMs) to generate the SQL. However, some necessary knowledge is not explicitly included in the database schema and user question or has been learned by LLMs. Thus, the generated SQL of the knowledge-insufficient questions may be inaccurate, negatively influencing the text-to-SQL models' performance and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge-to-SQL framework, which employs tailored Data Expert LLM (DELLM) to provide helpful knowledge for all text-to-SQL models. Specifically, we introduce the detailed implementation of DELLM regarding table reading and the basic fine-tuning process. We further propose a Preference Learning via Database Feedback (PLDBF) strategy, refining the DELLM to generate more helpful knowledge for LLMs. Extensive experiments verify that DELLM can enhance the state-of-the-art approaches for text-to-SQL tasks.",
    "Knowledgeable Preference Alignment for LLMs in Domain-specific Question Answering": "Deploying large language models (LLMs) to real scenarios for domain-specific question answering (QA) is a key thrust for LLM applications, which poses numerous challenges, especially in ensuring that responses are both accommodating to user requirements and appropriately leveraging domain-specific knowledge bases. They are the two major difficulties for LLM application as vanilla fine-tuning falls short of addressing. Combining these requirements, we conceive of them as the requirement for the model's preference to be harmoniously aligned with humans'. Thus, we introduce Knowledgeable Preference AlignmenT (KnowPAT), which constructs two kinds of preference sets to tackle the two issues. Besides, we design a new alignment objective to align the LLM preference with different human preferences uniformly, aiming to optimize LLM performance in real-world, domain-specific QA settings. Adequate experiments and comprehensive comparisons with 15 baseline methods illustrate that our KnowPAT is a superior pipeline for real-scenario domain-specific QA with LLMs.",
    "KoCommonGEN v2: A Benchmark for Navigating Korean Commonsense Reasoning Challenges in Large Language Models": "The evolution of large language models (LLMs) has culminated in a multitask model paradigm where prompts drive the generation of user-specific outputs. However, this advancement has revealed a challenge: LLMs frequently produce outputs against socially acceptable commonsense standards in various scenarios. To address this gap in commonsense reasoning, we present KoCommonGEN v2, a fine-grained benchmark dataset focused on Korean commonsense reasoning. This dataset, enriched with human annotations, comprises multiple-choice questions across seven error categories. These categories include commonsense memorization, numerical commonsense, toxic speech, and more, which are vulnerable to undermining the reliability of LLMs' commonsense reasoning capabilities. The empirical results present that LLMs struggle with Korean commonsense reasoning. With human accuracy benchmarked at approximately 85%, GPT-4's performance lags at about 74%, and other LLMs demonstrate an average accuracy of around 42%. Our findings emphasize the need for targeted improvements in Korean commonsense reasoning within LLMs, paving the way for more socially and contextually sensitive AI models. KoCommonGEN v2 is one of the benchmark datasets for the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard.",
    "KorNAT: LLM Alignment Benchmark for Korean Social Values and Common Knowledge": "For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be effectively deployed in a specific country, they must possess an understanding of the nation's culture and basic knowledge. To this end, we introduce National Alignment, which measures an alignment between an LLM and a targeted country from two aspects: social value alignment and common knowledge alignment. Social value alignment evaluates how well the model understands nation-specific social values, while common knowledge alignment examines how well the model captures basic knowledge related to the nation. We constructed KorNAT, the first benchmark that measures national alignment with South Korea. For the social value dataset, we obtained ground truth labels from a large-scale survey involving 6,174 unique Korean participants. For the common knowledge dataset, we constructed samples based on Korean textbooks and GED reference materials. KorNAT contains 4K and 6K multiple-choice questions for social value and common knowledge, respectively. Our dataset creation process is meticulously designed and based on statistical sampling theory and was refined through multiple rounds of human review. The experiment results of seven LLMs reveal that only a few models met our reference score, indicating a potential for further enhancement. KorNAT has received government approval after passing an assessment conducted by a government-affiliated organization dedicated to evaluating dataset quality. Samples and detailed evaluation protocols of our dataset can be found in https://huggingface.co/datasets/datumo/KorNAT.",
    "KPEVAL: Towards Fine-Grained Semantic-Based Keyphrase Evaluation": "Despite the significant advancements in keyphrase extraction and keyphrase generation methods, the predominant approach for evaluation mainly relies on exact matching with human references. This scheme fails to recognize systems that generate keyphrases semantically equivalent to the references or diverse keyphrases that carry practical utility. To better assess the capability of keyphrase systems, we propose KPEVAL, a comprehensive evaluation framework consisting of four critical aspects: reference agreement, faithfulness, diversity, and utility. For each aspect, we design semantic-based metrics to reflect the evaluation objectives. Meta-evaluation studies demonstrate that our evaluation strategy correlates better with human preferences compared to a range of previously proposed metrics. Using KPEVAL, we re-evaluate 23 keyphrase systems and discover that (1) established model comparison results have blind-spots especially when considering reference-free evaluation; (2) large language models are underestimated by prior evaluation works; and (3) there is no single best model that can excel in all the aspects.",
    "KpopMT: Translation Dataset with Terminology for Kpop Fandom": "While machines learn from existing corpora, humans have the unique capability to establish and accept new language systems. This makes human form unique language systems within social groups. Aligning with this, we focus on a gap remaining in addressing translation challenges within social groups, where in-group members utilize unique terminologies. We propose KpopMT dataset, which aims to fill this gap by enabling precise terminology translation, choosing Kpop fandom as an initiative for social groups given its global popularity. Expert translators provide 1k English translations for Korean posts and comments, each annotated with specific terminology within social groups' language systems. We evaluate existing translation systems including GPT models on KpopMT to identify their failure cases. Results show overall low scores, underscoring the challenges of reflecting group-specific terminologies and styles in translation. We make KpopMT publicly available.",
    "L-Eval: Instituting Standardized Evaluation for Long Context Language Models": "Recently, there has been growing interest in long-context scaling of large language models (LLMs). To facilitate research in this field, we propose L-Eval to institute a more standardized evaluation for Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) addressing two key aspects: dataset construction and evaluation metrics. On the one hand, we build a new evaluation suite containing 20 sub-tasks, 508 long documents, and more than 2,000 human-labeled query-response pairs including diverse task types, domains, and input length (3k∼200k tokens). On the other hand, we investigate the effectiveness of evaluation metrics for LCLMs and we show that Length-instruction-enhanced (LIE) evaluation and LLM judges can better correlate with human judgments. We conducted a comprehensive study of 4 popular commercial LLMs and 12 open-source counterparts using the L-Eval benchmark. Our empirical findings offer useful insights into the study of LCLMs and lay the groundwork for the development of a more principled evaluation of these models.",
    "Label Augmentation for Zero-Shot Hierarchical Text Classification": "Hierarchical Text Classification poses the difficult challenge of classifying documents into multiple labels organized in a hierarchy. The vast majority of works aimed to address this problem relies on supervised methods which are difficult to implement due to the scarcity of labeled data in many real world applications. This paper focuses on strict Zero-Shot Classification, the setting in which the system lacks both labeled instances and training data. We propose a novel approach that uses a Large Language Model to augment the deepest layer of the labels hierarchy in order to enhance its specificity. We achieve this by generating semantically relevant labels as children connected to the existing branches, creating a deeper taxonomy that better overlaps with the input texts. We leverage the enriched hierarchy to perform Zero-Shot Hierarchical Classification by using the Upward score Propagation technique. We test our method on four public datasets, obtaining new state-of-the art results on three of them. We introduce two cosine similarity-based metrics to quantify the density and granularity of a label taxonomy and we show a strong correlation between the metric values and the classification performance of our method on the datasets.",
    "LAMA at SMM4H 2024: Experimenting with Transformer-based and Large Language Models for Classifying Effects of Outdoor Spaces on Social Anxiety in Social Media Data": "Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is a common condition, affecting a significant portion of the population. While research suggests spending time in nature can alleviate anxiety, the specific impact on SAD remains unclear. This study explores the relationship between discussions of outdoor spaces and social anxiety on social media. We leverage transformer-based and large language models (LLMs) to analyze a social media dataset focused on SAD. We developed three methods for the task of predicting the effects of outdoor spaces on SAD in social media. A two-stage pipeline classifier achieved the best performance of our submissions with results exceeding baseline performance.",
    "LaMP: When Large Language Models Meet Personalization": "This paper highlights the importance of personalization in large language models and introduces the LaMP benchmark — a novel benchmark for training and evaluating language models for producing personalized outputs. LaMP offers a comprehensive evaluation framework with diverse language tasks and multiple entries for each user profile. It consists of seven personalized tasks, spanning three text classification and four text generation tasks. We additionally propose two retrieval augmentation approaches that retrieve personal items from each user profile for personalizing language model outputs. To this aim, we study various retrieval models, including term matching, semantic matching, and time-aware methods. Extensive experiments on LaMP for zero-shot and fine-tuned language models demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed retrieval augmentation approach and highlight the impact of personalization in various natural language tasks.",
    "LANDeRMT: Dectecting and Routing Language-Aware Neurons for Selectively Finetuning LLMs to Machine Translation": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results in multilingual translation even with limited bilingual supervision. The major challenges are catastrophic forgetting and parameter interference for finetuning LLMs when provided parallel training data. To address these challenges, we propose LANDeRMT, a Language-Aware Neuron Detecting and Routing framework that selectively finetunes LLMs to Machine Translation with diverse translation training data. In LANDeRMT, we evaluate the awareness of neurons to MT tasks and categorize them into language-general and language-specific neurons. This categorization enables selective parameter updates during finetuning, mitigating parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting issues. For the detected neurons, we further propose a conditional awareness-based routing mechanism to dynamically adjust language-general and language-specific capacity within LLMs, guided by translation signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LANDeRMT is very effective in learning translation knowledge, significantly improving translation quality over various strong baselines for multiple language pairs.",
    "Landmark Embedding: A Chunking-Free Embedding Method For Retrieval Augmented Long-Context Large Language Models": "Retrieval augmentation is a promising approach to handle long-context language modeling. However, the existing retrieval methods usually work with the chunked context, which is prone to inferior quality of semantic representation and incomplete retrieval of useful information. In this work, we propose a new method for the retrieval augmentation of long-context language modeling, called Landmark Embedding. Our method is characterized by threefold technical contributions. Firstly, we introduce a chunking-free architecture, which keeps the long context coherent such that high-quality embeddings can be generated for the fine-grained units within the context. Secondly, we present a position-aware objective function, which prioritizes the ultimate boundary for a consecutive span of information. By learning to discriminate such a special position, the useful information can be comprehensively retrieved for the query. Thirdly, we design a novel multi-stage learning algorithm, which makes the best use of readily available data and synthetic data for cost-effective training of the landmark embedding. In our experimental study, landmark embedding is able to substantially improve the performance for both LLaMA-2 and ChatGPT in a variety of long-context tasks; meanwhile, it also outperforms the existing retrieval methods with a notable advantage. Our model and code will be made publicly available.",
    "LANGBRIDGE: Multilingual Reasoning Without Multilingual Supervision": "We introduce LANGBRIDGE, a zero-shot approach to adapt language models for multilingual reasoning tasks without multilingual supervision. LANGBRIDGE operates by “bridging” two models, each specialized in different aspects: (1) one specialized in understanding multiple languages (e.g., mT5 encoder) and (2) one specialized in reasoning (e.g., Orca 2). LANGBRIDGE connects the two models by introducing minimal trainable parameters between them. Despite utilizing only English data for training, LANGBRIDGE considerably enhances the performance of language models on low-resource languages across mathematical reasoning, code completion, logical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. Our analysis suggests that the efficacy of LANGBRIDGE stems from the language-agnostic characteristics of multilingual representations. We publicly release our code and models.",
    "LangSuit·E: Planning, Controlling and Interacting with Large Language Models in Embodied Text Environments": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown inspiring achievements in constructing autonomous agents that rely on language descriptions as inputs. However, it remains unclear how well LLMs can function as few-shot or zero-shot embodied agents in dynamic interactive environments. To address this gap, we introduce LangSuit·E, a versatile and simulation-free testbed featuring 6 representative embodied tasks in textual embodied worlds. Compared with previous LLM-based testbeds, LangSuit·E (i) offers adaptability to diverse environments without multiple simulation engines, (ii) evaluates agents' capacity to develop “internalized world knowledge” with embodied observations, and (iii) allows easy customization of communication and action strategies. To address the embodiment challenge, we devise a novel chain-of-thought (CoT) schema, EmMem, which summarizes embodied states w.r.t. history information. Comprehensive benchmark results illustrate challenges and insights of embodied planning. LangSuit·E represents a significant step toward building embodied generalists in the context of language models.",
    "Language Model Adaption for Reinforcement Learning with Natural Language Action Space": "Reinforcement learning with natural language action space often suffers from the curse of dimensionality due to the combinatorial nature of the natural language. Previous research leverages pretrained language models to capture action semantics and reduce the size of the action space. However, since pretrained models are typically trained on general corpora, there can be an unpredictable mismatch between the priors encoded in pretrained models and the characteristics of the specific RL environment. To address this issue, we propose Mutual-Information Regularized Policy Optimization, MIPO. MIPO enables implicit and dynamic reduction of the action space. Starting from the prior provided by the pretrained language model, our method dynamically adjusts the prior during the learning process based on the guidance of mutual information regularization. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this policy optimization process leads to the monotonic improvement on the mutual-information regularized RL objective. Empirically, we conduct experiments in various environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of MIPO.",
    "LANGUAGE MODELS ARE HOMER SIMPSON! Safety Re-Alignment of Fine-tuned Language Models through Task Arithmetic": "Aligned language models face a significant limitation as their fine-tuning often results in compromised safety. To tackle this, we propose a simple method RESTA that performs LLM safety realignment. RESTA stands for RESToring Safety through Task Arithmetic. At its core, it involves a simple arithmetic addition of a safety vector to the weights of the compromised model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RESTA in both parameter-efficient and full fine-tuning, covering a wide range of downstream tasks, including instruction following in Chinese, English, and Hindi, as well as problem-solving capabilities in Code and Math. We also showcase the generalizability of RESTA on three existing safety evaluation benchmarks and a multilingual benchmark dataset proposed as a part of this work, consisting of 550 harmful questions covering 11 categories, each with 5 sub-categories of harm. Overall, RESTA decreases the harmfulness of the compromised model from 18.6% to 5.1% and from 9.2% to 1.5% in parameter-efficient and full fine-tuning, respectively, while maintaining most of the model's performance on the task. We release the source code at: https://github.com/declare-lab/resta.",
    "Language Models can Evaluate Themselves via Probability Discrepancy": "In this paper, we initiate our discussion by demonstrating how Large Language Models (LLMs), when tasked with responding to queries, display a more even probability distribution in their answers if they are more adept, as opposed to their less skilled counterparts. Expanding on this foundational insight, we propose a new self-evaluation method ProbDiff for assessing the efficacy of various LLMs. This approach obviates the necessity for an additional evaluation model or the dependence on external, proprietary models like GPT-4 for judgment. It uniquely utilizes the LLMs being tested to compute the probability discrepancy between the initial response and its revised versions. A higher discrepancy for a given query between two LLMs indicates a relatively weaker capability. Our findings reveal that ProbDiff achieves results on par with those obtained from evaluations based on GPT-4, spanning a range of scenarios that include natural language generation (NLG) tasks such as translation, summarization, and our proposed Xiaohongshu blog writing task, and benchmarks for LLM evaluation like AlignBench, MT-Bench, and AlpacaEval, across LLMs of varying magnitudes.",
    "Language Models can Exploit Cross-Task In-context Learning for Data-Scarce Novel Tasks": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed NLP with their remarkable In-context Learning (ICL) capabilities. Automated assistants based on LLMs are gaining popularity; however, adapting them to novel tasks is still challenging. While colossal models excel in zero-shot performance, their computational demands limit widespread use, and smaller language models struggle without context. This paper investigates whether LLMs can generalize from labeled examples of predefined tasks to novel tasks. Drawing inspiration from biological neurons and the mechanistic interpretation of the Transformer architecture, we explore the potential for information sharing across tasks. We design a cross-task prompting setup with three LLMs and show that LLMs achieve significant performance improvements despite no examples from the target task in the context. Cross-task prompting leads to a remarkable performance boost of 107% for LLaMA-2 7B, 18.6% for LLaMA-2 13B, and 3.2% for GPT 3.5 on average over zero-shot prompting, and performs comparable to standard in-context learning. The effectiveness of generating pseudo-labels for in-task examples is demonstrated, and our analyses reveal a strong correlation between the effect of cross-task examples and model activation similarities in source and target input tokens. This paper offers a first-of-its-kind exploration of LLMs' ability to solve novel tasks based on contextual signals from different task examples.",
    "Language Models Do Hard Arithmetic Tasks Easily and Hardly Do Easy Arithmetic Tasks": "The ability (and inability) of large language models (LLMs) to perform arithmetic tasks has been the subject of much theoretical and practical debate. We show that LLMs are frequently able to correctly and confidently predict the first digit of n-digit by m-digit multiplication tasks without using chain of thought reasoning, despite these tasks require compounding operations to solve. Simultaneously, LLMs in practice often fail to correctly or confidently predict the last digit of an n-digit by m-digit multiplication, a task equivalent to 1-digit by 1-digit multiplication which can be easily learned or memorized. We show that the latter task can be solved more robustly when the LLM is conditioned on all of the correct higher-order digits, which on average increases the confidence of the correct last digit on 5-digit by 5-digit multiplication tasks using Llama 2-13B by over 230% (0.13→0.43) and Mistral-7B by 150% (0.22→0.55).",
    "Language Models Don't Learn the Physical Manifestation of Language": "We argue that language-only models don't learn the physical manifestation of language. We present an empirical investigation of visual-auditory properties of language through a series of tasks, termed H-TEST. These tasks highlight a fundamental gap between human linguistic understanding and the sensory-deprived linguistic understanding of LLMs. In support of our hypothesis, 1. deliberate reasoning (Chain-of-Thought), 2. few-shot examples, or 3. stronger LLM from the same model family (LLaMA 2 13B →LLaMA 2 70B) has no significant effect on H-TEST performance. We bring in the philosophical case of Mary, who learns about the world in a sensory-deprived environment as a useful conceptual framework to understand how language-only models learn about the world (Jackson, 1986). Our experiments show that some of the strongest proprietary LLMs stay near random chance baseline accuracy of 50%, highlighting the limitations of linguistic knowledge acquired in the absence of sensory experience. Our code and data are available at <github.com/brucewlee/h-test>.",
    "Language models emulate certain cognitive profiles: An investigation of how predictability measures interact with individual differences": "To date, most investigations on surprisal and entropy effects in reading have been conducted on the group level, disregarding individual differences. In this work, we revisit the predictive power of surprisal and entropy measures estimated from a range of language models (LMs) on data of human reading times as a measure of processing effort by incorporating information of language users' cognitive capacities. To do so, we assess the predictive power of surprisal and entropy estimated from generative LMs on reading data obtained from individuals who also completed a wide range of psychometric tests. Specifically, we investigate if modulating surprisal and entropy relative to cognitive scores increases prediction accuracy of reading times, and we examine whether LMs exhibit systematic biases in the prediction of reading times for cognitively high- or low-performing groups, revealing what type of psycholinguistic subject a given LM emulates. Our study finds that in most cases, incorporating cognitive capacities increases predictive power of surprisal and entropy on reading times, and that generally, high performance in the psychometric tests is associated with lower sensitivity to predictability effects. Finally, our results suggest that the analyzed LMs emulate readers with lower verbal intelligence, suggesting that for a given target group (i.e., individuals with high verbal intelligence), these LMs provide less accurate predictability estimates.",
    "Language-Specific Neurons: The Key to Multilingual Capabilities in Large Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable multilingual capabilities without being pre-trained on specially curated multilingual parallel corpora. It remains a challenging problem to explain the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs process multilingual texts. In this paper, we delve into the composition of Transformer architectures in LLMs to pinpoint language-specific regions. Specially, we propose a novel detection method, language activation probability entropy (LAPE), to identify language-specific neurons within LLMs. Based on LAPE, we conduct comprehensive experiments on several representative LLMs, such as LLaMA-2, BLOOM, and Mistral. Our findings indicate that LLMs' proficiency in processing a particular language is predominantly due to a small subset of neurons, primarily situated in the models' top and bottom layers. Furthermore, we showcase the feasibility to “steer” the output language of LLMs by selectively activating or deactivating language-specific neurons. Our research provides important evidence to the understanding and exploration of the multilingual capabilities of LLMs.",
    "Large Language Models are Few-Shot Training Example Generators: A Case Study in Fallacy Recognition": "Recognizing fallacies is crucial for ensuring the quality and validity of arguments across various domains. However, computational fallacy recognition faces challenges due to the diverse genres, domains, and types of fallacies found in datasets. This leads to a highly multi-class, and even multi-label, setup with substantial class imbalance. In this study, we aim to enhance existing models for fallacy recognition by incorporating additional context and by leveraging large language models to generate synthetic data, thus increasing the representation of the infrequent classes. We experiment with GPT-3.5 to generate synthetic examples and we examine the impact of prompt settings for this. Moreover, we explore zero-shot and few-shot scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of using the generated examples for training smaller models within a unified fallacy recognition framework. Furthermore, we analyze the overlap between the synthetic data and existing fallacy datasets. Finally, we investigate the usefulness of providing supplementary context for detecting fallacy types that need such context, e.g., diversion fallacies. Our evaluation results demonstrate consistent improvements across fallacy types, datasets, and generators. The code and the synthetic datasets are all publicly available.",
    "Large Language Models Are No Longer Shallow Parsers": "The development of large language models (LLMs) brings significant changes to the field of natural language processing (NLP), enabling remarkable performance in various high-level tasks, such as machine translation, question-answering, dialogue generation, etc., under end-to-end settings without requiring much training data. Meanwhile, fundamental NLP tasks, particularly syntactic parsing, are also essential for language study as well as evaluating the capability of LLMs for instruction understanding and usage. In this paper, we focus on analyzing and improving the capability of current state-of-the-art LLMs on a classic fundamental task, namely constituency parsing, which is the representative syntactic task in both linguistics and natural language processing. We observe that these LLMs are effective in shallow parsing but struggle with creating correct full parse trees. To improve the performance of LLMs on deep syntactic parsing, we propose a three-step approach that firstly prompts LLMs for chunking, then filters out low-quality chunks, and finally adds the remaining chunks to prompts to instruct LLMs for parsing, with later enhancement by chain-of-thought prompting. Experimental results on English and Chinese benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on improving LLMs' performance on constituency parsing.",
    "Large Language Models are not Fair Evaluators": "In this paper, we uncover a positional bias in the evaluation paradigm of adopting large language models (LLMs), e.g., GPT-4, as a referee to score and compare the quality of responses generated by candidate models. We find that the quality ranking of candidate responses can be easily hacked by simply altering their order of appearance in the context. This manipulation allows us to skew the evaluation result, making one model appear considerably superior to the other, e.g., Vicuna-13B could beat ChatGPT on 66 over 80 tested queries with ChatGPT as an evaluator. We propose a simple yet effective calibration framework to address our discovered positional bias. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we manually annotate the “win/tie/lose” outcomes of responses from ChatGPT and Vicuna-13B in the Vicuna Benchmark's question prompt. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach successfully alleviates evaluation bias, resulting in closer alignment with human judgments. To facilitate future research on more robust large language model comparison, we integrate the techniques in the paper into an easy-to-use toolkit FairEval, along with the human annotations.",
    "Large Language Models are Superpositions of All Characters: Attaining Arbitrary Role-play via Self-Alignment": "Considerable efforts have been invested in augmenting the role-playing proficiency of open-source large language models (LLMs) by emulating proprietary counterparts. Nevertheless, we posit that LLMs inherently harbor role-play capabilities, owing to the extensive knowledge of characters and potential dialogues ingrained in their vast training corpora. Thus, in this study, we introduce DITTO, a self-alignment method for role-play. DITTO capitalizes on character knowledge, encouraging an instruction-following LLM to simulate role-play dialogues as a variant of reading comprehension. This method creates a role-play training set comprising 4000 characters, surpassing the scale of currently available datasets by tenfold regarding the number of roles. Subsequently, we fine-tune the LLM using this self-generated dataset to augment its role-playing capabilities. Upon evaluating our meticulously constructed and reproducible role-play benchmark and the roleplay subset of MT-Bench, DITTO in various parameter scales consistently maintains a consistent role identity and provides accurate role-specific knowledge in multi-turn role-play conversations. Notably, it outperforms all open-source role-play baselines, showcasing performance levels comparable to advanced proprietary chatbots. Furthermore, we present the first comprehensive cross-supervision alignment experiment in the role-play domain, revealing that the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs confine the knowledge within role-play. Meanwhile, the role-play styles can be easily acquired with the guidance of smaller models. We open-source related resources in https://github.com/OFA-Sys/Ditto.",
    "Large Language Models as Legal Translators of Arabic Legislation: Do ChatGPT and Gemini Care for Context and Terminology?": "Accurate translation of terminology and adaptation to in-context information is a pillar to high quality translation. Recently, there is a remarkable interest towards the use and the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) particularly for Machine Translation tasks. Nevertheless, despite their recent advancement and ability to understand and generate human-like language, these LLMs have not been thoroughly investigated and are still far from perfect, especially in domain-specific scenarios. This is particularly evident in automatically translating legal terminology from Arabic into English and French, where, beyond the inherent complexities of legal language and specialised translations, technical limitations of LLMs further hinder accurate generation of text. In this paper, we present a preliminary evaluation of two evolving LLMs 'Generative Pre-trained Transformer' and 'Gemini' as legal translators of Arabic legislation to test their accuracy and the extent to which they care for context and terminology across two language pairs (AR→EN / AR→FR). The study targets the evaluation of Zero-Shot prompting for in-context and out-of-context scenarios of both models relying on a gold standard dataset, verified by professional translators who are also experts in the field. We evaluate the results applying the Multidimensional Quality Metrics to classify translation errors. Moreover, we also evaluate the general LLMs outputs to verify their correctness, consistency, and completeness. In general, our results show that the models are far from perfect and recalls for more fine-tuning efforts using specialised terminological data in the legal domain from Arabic into English and French.",
    "Large Language Models as Zero-shot Dialogue State Tracker through Function Calling": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in conversational systems due to their advanced understanding and generative capabilities in general contexts. However, their effectiveness in task-oriented dialogues (TOD), which requires not only response generation but also effective dialogue state tracking (DST) within specific tasks and domains, remains less satisfying. In this work, we propose a novel approach FNCTOD for solving DST with LLMs through function calling. This method improves zero-shot DST, allowing adaptation to diverse domains without extensive data collection or model tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves exceptional performance with both modestly sized open-source and also proprietary LLMs: with in-context prompting it enables various 7B or 13B parameter models to surpass the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) achieved by ChatGPT, and improves ChatGPT's performance beating the SOTA by 5.6% average joint goal accuracy (JGA). Individual model results for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are boosted by 4.8% and 14%, respectively. We also show that by fine-tuning on a small collection of diverse task-oriented dialogues, we can equip modestly sized models, specifically a 13B parameter LLaMA2-Chat model, with function-calling capabilities and DST performance comparable to ChatGPT while maintaining their chat capabilities. We have made the code publicly available.",
    "Large Language Models Can Learn Representation in Natural Language": "One major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) is completing complex tasks involving multiple entities, such as tool APIs. To tackle this, one approach is to retrieve relevant entities to enhance LLMs in task completion. A crucial issue here is obtaining accurate natural language representations for each entity to aid in retriever precision. In this paper, we propose the Natural Language Representation Optimization Problem, which aims to refine entity descriptions for improved retrieval and LLM utilization. We introduce the Learning to Represent with Natural Language method, which utilizes LLMs to optimize entity representations consisting of text patterns based on environmental feedback. We iteratively prompt LLMs to enhance or adjust patterns based on entity samples and evaluate their effectiveness through environmental feedback. Our method successfully learns human-understandable representations for classification tasks (e.g., instructions and documents) and API call tasks (e.g., APIbench and Virtual Home), significantly improving GPT-4's task performance.",
    "Large Language Models Can Learn Temporal Reasoning": "While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, they are not without their flaws and inaccuracies. Recent studies have introduced various methods to mitigate these limitations. Temporal reasoning (TR), in particular, presents a significant challenge for LLMs due to its reliance on diverse temporal concepts and intricate temporal logic. In this paper, we propose TG-LLM, a novel framework towards language-based TR. Instead of reasoning over the original context, we adopt a latent representation, temporal graph (TG) that enhances the learning of TR. A synthetic dataset (TGQA), which is fully controllable and requires minimal supervision, is constructed for fine-tuning LLMs on this text-to-TG translation task. We confirmed in experiments that the capability of TG translation learned on our dataset can be transferred to other TR tasks and benchmarks. On top of that, we teach LLM to perform deliberate reasoning over the TGs via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) bootstrapping and graph data augmentation. We observed that those strategies, which maintain a balance between usefulness and diversity, bring more reliable CoTs and final results than the vanilla CoT distillation.",
    "Large Language Models can Share Images, Too!": "This paper explores the image-sharing capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and LLaMA 2, in a zero-shot setting. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs, we introduce the PHOTOCHAT++ dataset, which includes enriched annotations (i.e., intent, triggering sentence, image description, and salient information). Furthermore, we present the gradient-free and extensible Decide, Describe, and Retrieve (DRIBER) framework. With extensive experiments, we unlock the image-sharing capability of DRIBER equipped with LLMs in zero-shot prompting, with ChatGPT achieving the best performance. Our findings also reveal the emergent image-sharing ability in LLMs under zero-shot conditions, validating the effectiveness of DRIBER. We use this framework to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness in two real-world scenarios: (1) human-bot interaction and (2) dataset augmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the image-sharing ability of various LLMs in a zero-shot setting. We make our source code and dataset publicly available.",
    "Large language models fail to derive atypicality inferences in a human-like manner": "Recent studies have claimed that large language models (LLMs) are capable of drawing pragmatic inferences (Qiu et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2022; Barattieri di San Pietro et al., 2023). The present paper sets out to test LLM's abilities on atypicality inferences, a type of pragmatic inference that is triggered through informational redundancy. We test several state-of-the-art LLMs in a zero-shot setting and find that LLMs fail to systematically fail to derive atypicality inferences. Our robustness analysis indicates that when inferences are seemingly derived in a few-shot settings, these results can be attributed to shallow pattern matching and not pragmatic inferencing. We also analyse the performance of the LLMs at the different derivation steps required for drawing atypicality inferences - our results show that models have access to script knowledge and can use it to identify redundancies and accommodate the atypicality inference. The failure instead seems to stem from not reacting to the subtle maxim of quantity violations introduced by the informationally redundant utterances.",
    "Large Language Models Fall Short: Understanding Complex Relationships in Detective Narratives": "Existing datasets for narrative understanding often fail to represent the complexity and uncertainty of relationships in real-life social scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, Conan, designed for extracting and analysing intricate character relation graphs from detective narratives. Specifically, we designed hierarchical relationship categories and manually extracted and annotated role-oriented relationships from the perspectives of various characters, incorporating both public relationships known to most characters and secret ones known to only a few. Our experiments with advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama2 reveal their limitations in inferencing complex relationships and handling longer narratives. The combination of the Conan dataset and our pipeline strategy is geared towards understanding the ability of LLMs to comprehend nuanced relational dynamics in narrative contexts.",
    "Large Language Models for Automated Open-domain Scientific Hypotheses Discovery": "Hypothetical induction is recognized as the main reasoning type when scientists make observations about the world and try to propose hypotheses to explain those observations. Past research on hypothetical induction is under a constrained setting: (1) the observation annotations in the dataset are carefully manually hand-picked sentences (resulting in a close-domain setting); and (2) the ground truth hypotheses are mostly commonsense knowledge, making the task less challenging. In this work, we tackle these problems by proposing the first dataset for social science academic hypotheses discovery, with the final goal to create systems that automatically generate valid, novel, and helpful scientific hypotheses, given only a pile of raw web corpus. Unlike previous settings, the new dataset requires (1) using open-domain data (raw web corpus) as observations; and (2) proposing hypotheses even new to humanity. A multi-module framework is developed for the task, including three different feedback mechanisms to boost performance, which exhibits superior performance in terms of both GPT-4 based and expert-based evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work showing that LLMs are able to generate novel (“not existing in literature”) and valid (“reflecting reality”) scientific hypotheses.",
    "Large Language Models for Biomedical Knowledge Graph Construction: Information extraction from EMR notes": "The automatic construction of knowledge graphs (KGs) is an important research area in medicine, with far-reaching applications spanning drug discovery and clinical trial design. These applications hinge on the accurate identification of interactions among medical and biological entities. In this study, we propose an end-to-end machine learning solution based on large language models (LLMs) that utilize electronic medical record notes to construct KGs. The entities used in the KG construction process are diseases, factors, treatments, as well as manifestations that coexist with the patient while experiencing the disease. Given the critical need for high-quality performance in medical applications, we embark on a comprehensive assessment of 12 LLMs of various architectures, evaluating their performance and safety attributes. To gauge the quantitative efficacy of our approach by assessing both precision and recall, we manually annotate a dataset provided by the Macula and Retina Institute. We also assess the qualitative performance of LLMs, such as the ability to generate structured outputs or the tendency to hallucinate. The results illustrate that in contrast to encoder-only and encoder-decoder, decoder-only LLMs require further investigation. Additionally, we provide guided prompt design to utilize such LLMs. The application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on age-related macular degeneration.",
    "Large Language Models Relearn Removed Concepts": "Advances in model editing through neuron pruning hold promise for removing undesirable concepts from large language models. However, it remains unclear whether models have the capacity to reacquire pruned concepts after editing. To investigate this, we evaluate concept relearning in models by tracking concept saliency and similarity in pruned neurons during retraining for named entity recognition tasks. Our findings reveal that models can quickly regain performance post-pruning by relocating advanced concepts to earlier layers and reallocating pruned concepts to primed neurons with similar semantics. This demonstrates that models exhibit polysemantic capacities and can blend old and new concepts in individual neurons. While neuron pruning provides interpretability into model concepts, our results highlight the challenges of permanent concept removal for improved model safety. Monitoring concept reemergence and developing techniques to mitigate relearning of unsafe concepts will be important directions for more robust model editing. Overall, our work strongly demonstrates the resilience and fluidity of concept representations in LLMs post concept removal.",
    "Large Scale Narrative Messaging around Climate Change: A Cross-Cultural Comparison": "In this study, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 to extract and analyze the latent narrative messaging in climate change-related news articles from North American and Chinese media. By defining “narrative messaging” as the intrinsic moral or lesson of a story, we apply our model to a dataset of approximately 15,000 news articles in English and Mandarin, categorized by climate-related topics and ideological groupings. Our findings reveal distinct differences in the narrative values emphasized by different cultural and ideological contexts, with North American sources often focusing on individualistic and crisis-driven themes, while Chinese sources emphasize developmental and cooperative narratives. This work demonstrates the potential of LLMs in understanding and influencing climate communication, offering new insights into the collective belief systems that shape public discourse on climate change across different cultures.",
    "Latent Learningscape Guided In-context Learning": "The growing interest in leveraging large language models is driven by their exceptional imitation and reasoning capabilities. In-context learning (ICL), a streamlined method, has shown potential in boosting these models' performance without modifying their underlying parameters, especially when supplied with suitable demonstrations. However, existing methods mainly choose demonstrations by comparing surface-level semantic similarities (e.g., based on embedding) and fall short of identifying the most fitting ones. This paper introduces the concept of a “latent learningscape”, a more nuanced representation that describes the characteristic of the demonstrations. Building on this concept, we develop a results-driven approach to characterize the latent learningscape features of demonstrations, which then inform the creation of more effective prompts. Through comprehensive testing across datasets in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks, our approach outperforms leading models, showing an average increase in scores by 7.4 percentage points. The code and data will be made available here1.",
    "Latxa: An Open Language Model and Evaluation Suite for Basque": "We introduce Latxa, a family of large language models for Basque ranging from 7 to 70 billion parameters. Latxa is based on Llama 2, which we continue pretraining on a new Basque corpus comprising 4.3M documents and 4.2B tokens. Addressing the scarcity of high-quality benchmarks for Basque, we further introduce 4 multiple choice evaluation datasets: EusProficiency, comprising 5,169 questions from official language proficiency exams; EusReading, comprising 352 reading comprehension questions; EusTrivia, comprising 1,715 trivia questions from 5 knowledge areas; and EusExams, comprising 16,774 questions from public examinations. In our extensive evaluation, Latxa outperforms all previous open models we compare to by a large margin. In addition, it is competitive with GPT-4 Turbo in language proficiency and understanding, despite lagging behind in reading comprehension and knowledge-intensive tasks. Both the Latxa family of models, as well as our new pretraining corpora and evaluation datasets, are publicly available under open licenses. Our suite enables reproducible research on methods to build LLMs for low-resource languages.",
    "Layer-Condensed KV Cache for Efficient Inference of Large Language Models": "Huge memory consumption has been a major bottleneck for deploying high-throughput large language models in real-world applications. In addition to the large number of parameters, the key-value (KV) cache for the attention mechanism in the transformer architecture consumes a significant amount of memory, especially when the number of layers is large for deep language models. In this paper, we propose a novel method that only computes and caches the KVs of a small number of layers, thus significantly saving memory consumption and improving inference throughput. Our experiments on large language models show that our method achieves up to 26× higher throughput than standard transformers and competitive performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. In addition, our method is orthogonal to existing transformer memory-saving techniques, so it is straightforward to integrate them with our model, achieving further improvement in inference efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/whyNLP/LCKV.",
    "LayerSkip: Enabling Early Exit Inference and Self-Speculative Decoding": "We present LayerSkip, an end-to-end solution to speed-up inference of large language models (LLMs). First, during training we apply layer dropout, with low dropout rates for earlier layers and higher dropout rates for later layers, and an early exit loss where all transformer layers share the same exit. Second, during inference, we show that this training recipe increases the accuracy of early exit at earlier layers, without adding any auxiliary layers or modules to the model. Third, we present a novel self-speculative decoding solution where we exit at early layers and verify and correct with remaining layers of the model. Our proposed self-speculative decoding approach has less memory footprint than other speculative decoding approaches and benefits from shared compute and activations of the draft and verification stages. We run experiments on different Llama model sizes on different types of training: pretraining from scratch, continual pretraining, finetuning on specific data domain, and finetuning on specific task. We implement our inference solution and show speedups of up to 2.16× on summarization for CNN/DM documents, 1.82× on coding, and 2.0× on TOPv2 semantic parsing task. We open source code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/LayerSkip.",
    "LC4EE: LLMs as Good Corrector for Event Extraction": "Event extraction (EE) is a critical task in natural language processing, yet deploying a practical EE system remains challenging. On one hand, powerful large language models (LLMs) currently show poor performance because EE task is more complex than other tasks. On the other hand, state-of-the-art (SOTA) small language models (SLMs) for EE tasks are typically developed through fine-tuning, lack flexibility, and have considerable room for improvement. We propose an approach, LLMs-as-Corrector for Event Extraction (LC4EE), aiming to leverage the superior extraction capability of SLMs and the instruction-following ability of LLMs to construct a robust and highly available EE system. By utilizing LLMs to identify and correct errors of SLMs predictions based on automatically generated feedback information, EE performances can be improved significantly. Experimental results on the representative datasets ACE2005 and MAVEN-Arg for Event Detection (ED) and EE tasks validated the effectiveness of our method.",
    "Learn from Failure: Fine-Tuning LLMs with Trial-and-Error Data for Intuitionistic Propositional Logic Proving": "Recent advances in Automated Theorem Proving have shown the effectiveness of leveraging a (large) language model that generates tactics (i.e., proof steps) to search through proof states. The current model, while trained solely on successful proof paths, faces a discrepancy at the inference stage, as it must sample and try various tactics at each proof state until finding success, unlike its training which does not incorporate learning from failed attempts. Intuitively, a tactic that leads to a failed search path would indicate that similar tactics should receive less attention during the following trials. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefit of training models that additionally learn from failed search paths. Facing the lack of such trial-and-error data in existing open-source theorem-proving datasets, we curate a dataset on intuitionistic propositional logic theorems and formalize it in Lean, such that we can reliably check the correctness of proofs. We compare our model trained on relatively short trial-and-error information (TRIALMASTER) with models trained only on the correct paths and discover that the former solves more unseen theorems with lower trial searches.",
    "Learn or Recall? Revisiting Incremental Learning with Pre-trained Language Models": "Incremental Learning (IL) has been a long-standing problem in both vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) communities. In recent years, as Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various NLP downstream tasks, utilizing PLMs as backbones has become a common practice in recent research of IL in NLP. Most assume that catastrophic forgetting is the biggest obstacle to achieving superior IL performance and propose various techniques to overcome this issue. However, we find that this assumption is problematic. Specifically, we revisit more than 20 methods on four classification tasks (Text Classification, Intent Classification, Relation Extraction, and Named Entity Recognition) under the two most popular IL settings (Class-Incremental and Task-Incremental) and reveal that most of them severely underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting ability of PLMs. Based on the observation, we propose a frustratingly easy method called SEQ* for IL with PLMs. The results show that SEQ* has competitive or superior performance compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) IL methods yet requires considerably less trainable parameters and training time. These findings urge us to revisit the IL with PLMs and encourage future studies to have a fundamental understanding of the catastrophic forgetting in PLMs. The data, code and scripts are publicly available.",
    "Learnable Privacy Neurons Localization in Language Models": "Concerns regarding Large Language Models (LLMs) to memorize and disclose private information, particularly Personally Identifiable Information (PII), become prominent within the community. Many efforts have been made to mitigate the privacy risks. However, the mechanism through which LLMs memorize PII remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we introduce a pioneering method for pinpointing PII-sensitive neurons (privacy neurons) within LLMs. Our method employs learnable binary weight masks to localize specific neurons that account for the memorization of PII in LLMs through adversarial training. Our investigations discover that PII is memorized by a small subset of neurons across all layers, which shows the property of PII specificity. Furthermore, we propose to validate the potential in PII risk mitigation by deactivating the localized privacy neurons. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our neuron localization algorithm.",
    "Learning Fine-Grained Grounded Citations for Attributed Large Language Models": "Despite the impressive performance on information-seeking tasks, large language models (LLMs) still struggle with hallucinations. Attributed LLMs, which augment generated text with in-line citations, demonstrate potential in mitigating hallucinations and improving verifiability. However, current approaches suffer from suboptimal citation quality due to their reliance on in-context learning. Furthermore, the practice of merely citing document identifiers complicates the process for users to pinpoint specific supporting evidence. In this work, we introduce FRONT, a training framework that teaches LLMs to generate Fine-gRained grOuNded ciTations. By initially grounding fine-grained supporting quotes, which then guide the generation process, these quotes not only provide supervision signals to improve citation quality but also serve as fine-grained attributions. Experiments on the ALCE benchmark demonstrate the efficacy of FRONT in generating superior grounded responses and highly supportive citations. With LLaMA-2-7B, the framework significantly outperforms all the baselines, achieving an average of 14.21% improvement in citation quality across all datasets, even surpassing ChatGPT.",
    "Learning Geometry-Aware Representations for New Intent Discovery": "New intent discovery (NID) is an important problem for deploying practical dialogue systems, which trains intent classifiers on a semi-supervised corpus where unlabeled user utterances contain both known and novel intents. Most existing NID algorithms place hope on the sample similarity to cluster unlabeled corpus to known or new samples. Lacking supervision on new intents, we experimentally find the intent classifier fails to fully distinguish new intents since they tend to assemble into intertwined centers. To address this problem, we propose a novel GeoID framework that learns geometry-aware representations to maximally separate all intents. Specifically, we are motivated by the recent findings on Neural Collapse (NC) in classification tasks to derive optimal intent center structure. Meanwhile, we devise a dual pseudo-labeling strategy based on optimal transport assignments and semi-supervised clustering, ensuring proper utterances-to-center arrangement. Extensive results show that our GeoID method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance, achieving a +3.49% average accuracy improvement on three standardized benchmarking datasets. We also verify its usefulness in assisting large language models for improved in-context performance. The code is available at https://github.com/zjutangk/GeoID.",
    "Learning Global Controller in Latent Space for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning": "While large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable prowess in various natural language processing tasks, their training costs are exorbitant. Consequently, a plethora of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have emerged to tailor large models for downstream tasks, including low-rank training. Recent approaches either amalgamate existing fine-tuning methods or dynamically adjust rank allocation. Nonetheless, these methods continue to grapple with issues like local optimization, inability to train with full rank and lack of focus on specific tasks. In this paper, we introduce an innovative parameter-efficient method for exploring optimal solutions within latent space. More specifically, we introduce a set of latent units designed to iteratively extract input representations from LLMs, continuously refining informative features that enhance downstream task performance. Due to the small and independent nature of the latent units in relation to input size, this significantly reduces training memory requirements. Additionally, we employ an asymmetric attention mechanism to facilitate bidirectional interaction between latent units and freezed LLM representations, thereby mitigating issues associated with non-full-rank training. Furthermore, we apply distillation over hidden states during the interaction, which guarantees a trimmed number of trainable parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of natural language understanding, generation and reasoning tasks.",
    "Learning Multimodal Contrast with Cross-modal Memory and Reinforced Contrast Recognition": "In many practical scenarios, contents from different modalities are not semantically aligned; for instance, visual and textual information may conflict with each other, resulting in non-compositional expression effects such as irony or humor. Effective modeling and smooth integration of multimodal information are crucial for achieving good understanding of the contrast across modalities. Being focusing on image-text matching, most current studies face challenges in identifying such contrast, leading to limitations in exploring the extended semantics when images and texts do not match. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach for learning multimodal contrast following the encoding-decoding paradigm, enhanced by a memory module with reinforced contrast recognition, and use a series of tasks that have the nature of multimodal contrast to verify our approach. The memory module learns the integration between visual and textual features with trainable memory vectors and the reinforced contrast recognition uses self-rejection sampling to optimize the memory to further enhance learning multimodal contrast. The resulted information, accompanied with visual and text features, is finally fed into the LLM to predict corresponding labels. We experiment our approach on four English and Chinese benchmark datasets, where it outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art studies.",
    "Learning or Self-aligning? Rethinking Instruction Fine-tuning": "Instruction Fine-tuning (IFT) is a crucial phase in building large language models (LLMs). Previous works mainly focus on the IFT's role in the transfer of behavioral norms and the learning of additional world knowledge. However, the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of IFT remains significantly limited. In this paper, we design a knowledge intervention framework to decouple the potential underlying factors of IFT, thereby enabling individual analysis of different factors. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that attempting to learn additional world knowledge through IFT often struggles to yield positive impacts and can even lead to markedly negative effects. Further, we discover that maintaining internal knowledge consistency before and after IFT is a critical factor for achieving successful IFT. Our findings reveal the underlying mechanisms of IFT and provide robust support for some very recent and potential future works. We release our experimental dataset and codes to facilitate future work.",
    "Learning Task Decomposition to Assist Humans in Competitive Programming": "When using language models (LMs) to solve complex problems, humans might struggle to understand the LM-generated solutions and repair the flawed ones. To assist humans in repairing them, we propose to automatically decompose complex solutions into multiple simpler pieces that correspond to specific subtasks. We introduce a novel objective for learning task decomposition, termed assistive value (AssistV), which measures the feasibility and speed for humans to repair the decomposed solution. We collect a dataset of human repair experiences on different decomposed solutions. Utilizing the collected data as in-context examples, we then learn to critique, refine, and rank decomposed solutions to improve AssistV. We validate our method under competitive programming problems: under 177 hours of human study, our method enables non-experts to solve 33.3% more problems, speeds them up by 3.3x, and empowers them to match unassisted experts.",
    "Learning to Decode Collaboratively with Multiple Language Models": "We propose a method to teach multiple large language models (LLM) to collaborate by interleaving their generations at the token level. We model the decision of which LLM generates the next token as a latent variable. By optimizing the marginal likelihood of a training set under our latent variable model, the base LLM automatically learns when to generate itself and when to call on one of the “assistant” language models to generate, all without direct supervision. Token-level collaboration during decoding allows for a fusion of each model's expertise in a manner tailored to the specific task at hand. Our collaborative decoding is especially useful in cross-domain settings where a generalist base LLM learns to invoke domain expert models. On instruction-following, domain-specific QA, and reasoning tasks, we show that the performance of the joint system exceeds that of the individual models. Through qualitative analysis of the learned latent decisions, we show models trained with our method exhibit several interesting collaboration patterns, e.g., template-filling.",
    "Learning to Edit: Aligning LLMs with Knowledge Editing": "Knowledge editing techniques, aiming to efficiently modify a minor proportion of knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without negatively impacting performance across other inputs, have garnered widespread attention. However, existing methods predominantly rely on memorizing the updated knowledge, impeding LLMs from effectively combining the new knowledge with their inherent knowledge when answering questions. To this end, we propose a Learning to Edit (LTE) framework, focusing on teaching LLMs to apply updated knowledge into input questions, inspired by the philosophy of “Teach a man to fish.” LTE features a two-phase process: (i) the Alignment Phase, which fine-tunes LLMs on a meticulously curated parallel dataset to make reliable, in-scope edits while preserving out-of-scope information and linguistic proficiency; and (ii) the Inference Phase, which employs a retrieval-based mechanism for real-time and mass knowledge editing. By comparing our approach with seven advanced baselines across four popular knowledge editing benchmarks and two LLM architectures, we demonstrate LTE's superiority in knowledge editing performance, robustness in both batch and sequential editing, minimal interference on general tasks, and rapid editing speeds.",
    "Learning to Generate Answers with Citations via Factual Consistency Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate, impeding their reliability in mission-critical situations. One approach to address this issue is to provide citations to relevant sources alongside generated content, enhancing the verifiability of generations. However, citing passages accurately in answers remains a substantial challenge. This paper proposes a weakly-supervised fine-tuning method leveraging factual consistency models (FCMs). Our approach alternates between generating texts with citations and supervised fine-tuning with FCM-filtered citation data. Focused learning is integrated into the objective, directing the fine-tuning process to emphasise the factual unit tokens, as measured by an FCM. Results on the ALCE few-shot citation benchmark with various instruction-tuned LLMs demonstrate superior performance compared to in-context learning, vanilla supervised fine-tuning, and state-of-the-art methods, with an average improvement of 34.1, 15.5, and 10.5 citation F1 points, respectively. Moreover, in a domain transfer setting we show that the obtained citation generation ability robustly transfers to unseen datasets. Notably, our citation improvements contribute to the lowest factual error rate across baselines.",
    "Learning to Generate Instruction Tuning Datasets for Zero-Shot Task Adaptation": "We introduce Bonito, an open-source model for conditional task generation that converts unannotated text into task-specific training datasets for instruction tuning. We aim to enable zero-shot task adaptation of large language models on users' specialized, private data. We train Bonito by fine-tuning a pretrained large language model on a new large-scale dataset with 1.65M examples created by remixing existing instruction tuning datasets into meta-templates. The meta-templates for a dataset produce training examples where the input is the unannotated text and the task attribute and the output consists of the instruction and the response. We use Bonito to generate synthetic tasks for seven datasets from specialized domains with unannotated text across three task types—yes-no question answering, extractive question answering, and natural language inference—and adapt language models. We show that Bonito significantly improves the average performance of pretrained and instruction tuned models over the de facto self supervised baseline. For example, adapting Mistral-Instruct-v2 and instruction tuned variants of Mistral and Llama2 with Bonito improves the strong zero-shot performance by 22.1 F1 points whereas the next word prediction objective undoes some of the benefits of instruction tuning and reduces the average performance by 0.8 F1 points. We conduct additional experiments with Bonito to understand the effects of the domain, the size of the training set, and the choice of alternative synthetic task generators. Overall, we show that learning with synthetic instruction tuning datasets is an effective way to adapt language models to new domains.",
    "Learning to Plan and Generate Text with Citations": "The increasing demand for the deployment of LLMs in information-seeking scenarios has spurred efforts in creating verifiable systems, which generate responses to queries along with supporting evidence. In this paper, we explore the attribution capabilities of plan-based models which have been recently shown to improve the faithfulness, grounding, and controllability of generated text. We conceptualize plans as a sequence of questions which serve as blueprints of the generated content and its organization. We propose two attribution models that utilize different variants of blueprints, an abstractive model where questions are generated from scratch, and an extractive model where questions are copied from the input. Experiments on long-form question-answering show that planning consistently improves attribution quality. Moreover, the citations generated by blueprint models are more accurate compared to those obtained from LLM-based pipelines lacking a planning component.",
    "Learning to Trust Your Feelings: Leveraging Self-awareness in LLMs for Hallucination Mitigation": "We evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discern and express their internal knowledge state, a key factor in countering factual hallucination and ensuring reliable application of LLMs. We observe a robust self-awareness of internal knowledge state in LLMs, evidenced by over 85% accuracy in knowledge state probing. However, LLMs often fail to faithfully express their internal knowledge during generation, leading to factual hallucinations. We develop an automated hallucination annotation tool, DreamCatcher, which merges knowledge probing and consistency checking methods to rank factual preference data. Using knowledge preference as reward, we propose a Reinforcement Learning from Knowledge Feedback (RLKF) training framework, leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance the factuality and honesty of LLMs. Our experiments across multiple models show that RLKF training effectively enhances the ability of models to utilize their internal knowledge state, boosting performance in a variety of knowledge-based and honesty-related tasks.",
    "Learning-From-Mistakes Prompting for Indigenous Language Translation": "Using large language models, this paper presents techniques to improve extremely low-resourced indigenous language translations. Our approaches are grounded in the use of (1) the presence of a datastore consisting of a limited number of parallel translation examples, (2) the inherent capabilities of LLMs like GPT-3.5, and (3) a word-level translation dictionary. We harness the potential of LLMs and in-context learning techniques in such a setting for using LLM as universal translators for extremely low-resourced languages. Our methodology hinges on utilizing LLMs as language compilers for selected language pairs, hypothesizing that they could internalize syntactic structures to facilitate accurate translation. We introduce three techniques: KNN-Prompting with Retrieved Prompting Context, Chain-of-Thought Prompting, and Learning-from-Mistakes Prompting, with the last method addressing past errors. The evaluation results suggest that, even with limited corpora, LLMs, when paired with proper prompting, can effectively translate extremely low-resource languages.",
    "Legal Judgment Reimagined: PredEx and the Rise of Intelligent AI Interpretation in Indian Courts": "In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), predicting judicial outcomes poses significant challenges due to the complexity of legal proceedings and the scarcity of expert-annotated datasets. Addressing this, we introduce Prediction with Explanation (PredEx), the largest expert-annotated dataset for legal judgment prediction and explanation in the Indian context, featuring over 15,000 annotations. This groundbreaking corpus significantly enhances the training and evaluation of AI models in legal analysis, with innovations including the application of instruction tuning to LLMs. This method has markedly improved the predictive accuracy and explanatory depth of these models for legal judgments. We employed various transformer-based models, tailored for both general and Indian legal contexts. Through rigorous lexical, semantic, and expert assessments, our models effectively leverage PredEx to provide precise predictions and meaningful explanations, establishing it as a valuable benchmark for both the legal profession and the NLP community.",
    "LEGENT: Open Platform for Embodied Agents": "Despite advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), their integration into language-grounded, human-like embodied agents remains incomplete, hindering complex real-life task performance in physical environments. Existing integrations often feature limited open sourcing, challenging collective progress in this field. We introduce LEGENT, an open, scalable platform for developing embodied agents using LLMs and LMMs. LEGENT offers a dual approach: a rich, interactive 3D environment with communicable and actionable agents, paired with a user-friendly interface, and a sophisticated data generation pipeline utilizing advanced algorithms to exploit supervision from simulated worlds at scale. In our experiments, an embryonic vision-language-action model trained on LEGENT-generated data surpasses GPT-4V in embodied tasks, showcasing promising generalization capabilities.

    "LEIA: Facilitating Cross-lingual Knowledge Transfer in Language Models with Entity-based Data Augmentation": "Adapting English-based large language models (LLMs) to other languages has become increasingly popular due to the efficiency and potential of cross-lingual transfer. However, existing language adaptation methods often overlook the benefits of cross-lingual supervision. In this study, we introduce LEIA, a language adaptation tuning method that utilizes Wikipedia entity names aligned across languages. This method involves augmenting the target language corpus with English entity names and training the model using left-to-right language modeling. We assess LEIA on diverse question answering datasets using 7B-parameter LLMs, demonstrating significant performance gains across various non-English languages.",
    "LEMON: Reviving Stronger and Smaller LMs from Larger LMs with Linear Parameter Fusion": "In the new era of language models, small models (with billions of parameter sizes) are receiving increasing attention due to their flexibility and cost-effectiveness in deployment. However, limited by the model size, the performance of small models trained from scratch may often be unsatisfactory. Learning a stronger and smaller model with the help of larger models is an intuitive idea. Inspired by the observing modular structures in preliminary analysis, we propose LEMON to learn competent initial points for smaller models by fusing parameters from larger models, thereby laying a solid foundation for subsequent training. Specifically, the parameter fusion process involves two operators for layer and dimension, respectively, and we also introduce controllable receptive fields to model the prior parameter characteristics. In this way, the larger model could be transformed into any specific smaller scale and architecture. Starting from LLaMA 2-7B, we revive two stronger and smaller models with 1.3B and 2.7B. Experimental results demonstrate that the fusion-based method exhibits flexibility and outperforms a series of competitive baselines in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.",
    "Less is KEN: a Universal and Simple Non-Parametric Pruning Algorithm for Large Language Models": "Neural network pruning has become increasingly crucial due to the complexity of these models and their widespread use in various fields. Existing pruning algorithms often suffer from limitations such as architecture specificity, excessive complexity, and reliance on demanding calculations, rendering them impractical for real-world applications. This paper introduces KEN: a straightforward, universal, and unstructured pruning algorithm based on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). KEN aims to construct optimized transformers by selectively preserving the most significant parameters while restoring others to their pre-training state. This strategy preserves model performance while enabling storage of only the optimized subnetwork, leading to substantial memory savings. Extensive evaluations across seven different LLMs demonstrate that KEN achieves equal or better performance than their original unpruned versions, with a minimum parameter reduction of 25%. Furthermore, in-depth comparisons with established pruning and PEFT algorithms confirm KEN effectiveness. We further introduce KENviz, an explainable tool that visualizes the optimized model composition achieved by KEN from different points of view.",
    "Less is More: Mitigating Multimodal Hallucination from an EOS Decision Perspective": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from multimodal hallucinations, wherein they may create content that is not present in the visual inputs. In this paper, we explore a new angle of this issue: overly detailed training data hinders the model's ability to timely terminate generation, leading to continued outputs beyond visual perception limits. By investigating how the model decides to terminate generation with EOS, the special end-of-sentence token, we find that the model assesses the completeness of the entire sequence by comparing the generated text with the image. This observation suggests that the model possesses an inherent potential of making proper EOS decisions based on its visual perception to avoid overly lengthy outputs. To take advantage of such potential, we explore two methods to mitigate multimodal hallucinations: a training objective that enables the model to reduce hallucinations by learning from regular instruction data, and a data filtering strategy to prevent harmful training data from exacerbating model hallucinations. Both methods significantly improve the hallucination performance of LVLMs, without requiring any additional data or knowledge.",
    "Let's Go Real Talk: Spoken Dialogue Model for Face-to-Face Conversation": "In this paper, we introduce a novel Face-to-Face spoken dialogue model. It processes audio-visual speech from user input and generates audio-visual speech as the response, marking the initial step towards creating an avatar chatbot system without relying on intermediate text. To this end, we newly introduce MultiDialog, the first large-scale multimodal (i.e., audio and visual) spoken dialogue corpus containing 340 hours of approximately 9,000 dialogues, recorded based on the open domain dialogue dataset, TopicalChat. The MultiDialog contains parallel audio-visual recordings of conversation partners acting according to the given script with emotion annotations, which we expect to open up research opportunities in multimodal synthesis. Our Face-to-Face spoken dialogue model incorporates a textually pretrained large language model and adapts it into the audio-visual spoken dialogue domain by incorporating speech-text joint pretraining. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our model in facilitating a face-to-face conversation.",
    "Leveraging Codebook Knowledge with NLI and ChatGPT for Zero-Shot Political Relation Classification": "Is it possible accurately classify political relations within evolving event ontologies without extensive annotations? This study investigates zero-shot learning methods that use expert knowledge from existing annotation codebook, and evaluates the performance of advanced ChatGPT (GPT-3.5/4) and a natural language inference (NLI)-based model called ZSP. ChatGPT uses codebook's labeled summaries as prompts, whereas ZSP breaks down the classification task into context, event mode, and class disambiguation to refine task-specific hypotheses. This decomposition enhances interpretability, efficiency, and adaptability to schema changes. The experiments reveal ChatGPT's strengths and limitations, and crucially show ZSP's outperformance of dictionary-based methods and its competitive edge over some supervised models. These findings affirm the value of ZSP for validating event records and advancing ontology development. Our study underscores the efficacy of leveraging transfer learning and existing domain expertise to enhance research efficiency and scalability. The code is publicly available.",
    "Leveraging Graph Structures to Detect Hallucinations in Large Language Models": "Large language models are extensively applied across a wide range of tasks, such as customer support, content creation, educational tutoring, and providing financial guidance. However, a well-known drawback is their predisposition to generate hallucinations. This damages the trustworthiness of the information these models provide, impacting decision-making and user confidence. We propose a method to detect hallucinations by looking at the structure of the latent space and finding associations within hallucinated and non-hallucinated generations. We create a graph structure that connects generations that lie closely in the embedding space. Moreover, we employ a Graph Attention Network which utilizes message passing to aggregate information from neighboring nodes and assigns varying degrees of importance to each neighbor based on their relevance. Our findings show that 1) there exists a structure in the latent space that differentiates between hallucinated and non-hallucinated generations, 2) Graph Attention Networks can learn this structure and generalize it to unseen generations, and 3) the robustness of our method is enhanced when incorporating contrastive learning. When evaluated against evidence-based benchmarks, our model performs similarly without access to search-based methods.",
    "Leveraging Large Language Models for Learning Complex Legal Concepts through Storytelling": "Making legal knowledge accessible to non-experts is crucial for enhancing general legal literacy and encouraging civic participation in democracy. However, legal documents are often challenging to understand for people without legal backgrounds. In this paper, we present a novel application of large language models (LLMs) in legal education to help non-experts learn intricate legal concepts through storytelling, an effective pedagogical tool in conveying complex and abstract concepts. We also introduce a new dataset LEGALSTORIES, which consists of 294 complex legal doctrines, each accompanied by a story and a set of multiple-choice questions generated by LLMs. To construct the dataset, we experiment with various LLMs to generate legal stories explaining these concepts. Furthermore, we use an expert-in-the-loop approach to iteratively design multiple-choice questions. Then, we evaluate the effectiveness of storytelling with LLMs through randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with legal novices on 10 samples from the dataset. We find that LLM-generated stories enhance comprehension of legal concepts and interest in law among non-native speakers compared to only definitions. Moreover, stories consistently help participants relate legal concepts to their lives. Finally, we find that learning with stories shows a higher retention rate for non-native speakers in the follow-up assessment. Our work has strong implications for using LLMs in promoting teaching and learning in the legal field and beyond.",
    "Leveraging LLM Reasoning Enhances Personalized Recommender Systems": "Recent advancements have showcased the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in executing reasoning tasks, particularly facilitated by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. While tasks like arithmetic reasoning involve clear, definitive answers and logical chains of thought, the application of LLM reasoning in recommendation systems (RecSys) presents a distinct challenge. RecSys tasks revolve around subjectivity and personalized preferences, an under-explored domain in utilizing LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our study explores several aspects to better understand reasoning for RecSys and demonstrate how task quality improves by utilizing LLM reasoning in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. Additionally, we propose Rec-SAVER (Recommender Systems Automatic Verification and Evaluation of Reasoning) to automatically assess the quality of LLM reasoning responses without the requirement of curated gold references or human raters. We show that our framework aligns with real human judgment on the coherence and faithfulness of reasoning responses. Overall, our work shows that incorporating reasoning into RecSys can improve personalized tasks, paving the way for further advancements in recommender system methodologies.",
    "Leveraging LLMs and Web-based Visualizations for Profiling Bacterial Host Organisms and Genetic Toolboxes": "Building genetic tools to engineer microorganisms is at the core of understanding and redesigning natural biological systems for useful purposes. Every project to build such a genetic toolbox for an organism starts with a survey of available tools. Despite a decade-long investment and advancement in the field, it is still challenging to mine information about a genetic tool published in the literature and connect that information to microbial genomics and other microbial databases. This information gap not only limits our ability to identify and adopt available tools to a new chassis but also conceals available opportunities to engineer a new microbial host. Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs), offer solutions by enabling efficient extraction of genetic terms and biological entities from a vast array of publications. This work presents a method to automate this process, using text-mining to refine models with data from bioRxiv and other databases. We evaluated various LLMs to investigate their ability to recognize bacterial host organisms and genetic toolboxes for engineering. We demonstrate our methodology with a web application that integrates a conversational LLM and visualization tool, connecting user inquiries to genetic resources and literature findings, thereby saving researchers time, money, and effort in their laboratory work.",
    "Leveraging Machine-Generated Rationales to Facilitate Social Meaning Detection in Conversations": "We present a generalizable classification approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate the detection of implicitly encoded social meaning in conversations. We design a multi-faceted prompt to extract a textual explanation of the reasoning that connects visible cues to underlying social meanings. These extracted explanations or rationales serve as augmentations to the conversational text to facilitate dialogue understanding and transfer. Our empirical results over 2,340 experimental settings demonstrate the significant positive impact of adding these rationales. Our findings hold true for in-domain classification, zero-shot, and few-shot domain transfer for two different social meaning detection tasks, each spanning two different corpora.",
    "Lexicon-Level Contrastive Visual Grounding Improves Language Modeling": "Today's most accurate language models are trained on orders of magnitude more language data than human language learners receive—but with no supervision from other sensory modalities that play a crucial role in human learning. Can we make LMs' representations and predictions more accurate (and more human-like) with more ecologically plausible supervision? This paper describes LexiContrastive Grounding (LCG), a grounded language learning procedure that leverages visual supervision to improve textual representations. LexiContrastive Grounding combines a next-token prediction strategy with a contrastive visual grounding objective, focusing on early-layer representations that encode lexical information. Across multiple word-learning and sentence-understanding benchmarks, LexiContrastive Grounding not only outperforms standard language-only models in terms of learning efficiency in small and developmentally plausible data regimes, but also improves upon vision-and-language learning procedures including CLIP, GIT, Flamingo, and Vokenization. Moreover, LexiContrastive Grounding improves perplexity by around 5% on multiple language modeling tasks compared to other models trained on the same amount of text data. This work underscores the potential of incorporating visual grounding into language models, aligning more closely with the multimodal nature of human language acquisition.",
    "LIEDER: Linguistically-Informed Evaluation for Discourse Entity Recognition": "Discourse Entity (DE) recognition is the task of identifying novel and known entities introduced within a text. While previous work has found that large language models have basic, if imperfect, DE recognition abilities (Schuster and Linzen, 2022), it remains largely unassessed which of the fundamental semantic properties that govern the introduction and subsequent reference to DEs they have knowledge of. We propose the Linguistically-Informed Evaluation for Discourse Entity Recognition (LIEDER) dataset that allows for a detailed examination of language models' knowledge of four crucial semantic properties: EXISTENCE, UNIQUENESS, PLURALITY, and NOVELTY. We find evidence that state-of-the-art large language models exhibit sensitivity to all of these properties except NOVELTY, which demonstrates that they have yet to reach human-level language understanding abilities.",
    "Light-PEFT: Lightening Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning via Early Pruning": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as the predominant technique for fine-tuning in the era of large language models. However, existing PEFT methods still have inadequate training efficiency. Firstly, the utilization of large-scale foundation models during the training process is excessively redundant for certain fine-tuning tasks. Secondly, as the model size increases, the growth in trainable parameters of empirically added PEFT modules becomes non-negligible and redundant, leading to inefficiency. To achieve task-specific efficient fine-tuning, we propose the Light-PEFT framework, which includes two methods: Masked Early Pruning of the Foundation Model and Multi-Granularity Early Pruning of PEFT. The Light-PEFT framework allows for the simultaneous estimation of redundant parameters in both the foundation model and PEFT modules during the early stage of training. These parameters can then be pruned for more efficient fine-tuning. We validate our approach on GLUE, SuperGLUE, QA tasks, and various models. With Light-PEFT, parameters of the foundation model can be pruned by up to over 40%, while still controlling trainable parameters to be only 25% of the original PEFT method. Compared to utilizing the PEFT method directly, Light-PEFT achieves training and inference speedup, reduces memory usage, and maintains comparable performance and the plug-and-play feature of PEFT.",
    "Lightweight reranking for language model generations": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can exhibit considerable variation in the quality of their sampled outputs. Reranking and selecting the best generation from the sampled set is a popular way of obtaining strong gains in generation quality. In this paper, we present a novel approach for reranking LLM generations. Unlike other techniques that might involve additional inferences or training a specialized reranker, our approach relies on easy to compute pairwise statistics between the generations that have minimal compute overhead. We show that our approach can be formalized as an extension of self-consistency and analyze its performance in that framework, theoretically as well as via simulations. We show strong improvements for selecting the best k generations for code generation tasks as well as robust improvements for the best generation for the tasks of autoformalization, summarization, and translation. While our approach only assumes black-box access to LLMs, we show that additional access to token probabilities can improve performance even further.",
    "Likelihood-based Mitigation of Evaluation Bias in Large Language Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate natural language generation tasks as automated metrics. However, the likelihood, a measure of LLM's plausibility for a sentence, can vary due to superficial differences in sentences, such as word order and sentence structure. It is therefore possible that there might be a likelihood bias if LLMs are used for evaluation: they might overrate sentences with higher likelihoods while underrating those with lower likelihoods. In this paper, we investigate the presence and impact of likelihood bias in LLM-based evaluators. We also propose a method to mitigate the likelihood bias. Our method utilizes highly biased instances as few-shot examples for in-context learning. Our experiments in evaluating the data-to-text and grammatical error correction tasks reveal that several LLMs we test display a likelihood bias. Furthermore, our proposed method successfully mitigates this bias, also improving evaluation performance (in terms of correlation of models with human scores) significantly.",
    "LinguaLinked: Distributed Large Language Model Inference on Mobile Devices": "Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) locally on mobile devices presents a significant challenge due to their extensive memory requirements. In this paper, we introduce LinguaLinked, a system for decentralized, distributed LLM inference on mobile devices. LinguaLinked enables collaborative execution of the inference task across multiple trusted devices and ensures data privacy by processing information locally. LinguaLinked uses three key strategies. First, an optimized model assignment technique segments LLMs and uses linear optimization to align segments with each device's capabilities. Second, an optimized data transmission mechanism ensures efficient and structured data flow between model segments while also maintaining the integrity of the original model structure. Finally, LinguaLinked incorporates a runtime load balancer that actively monitors and redistributes tasks among mobile devices to prevent bottlenecks, enhancing the system's overall efficiency and responsiveness. We demonstrate that LinguaLinked facilitates efficient LLM inference while maintaining consistent throughput and minimal latency through extensive testing across various mobile devices, from high-end to low-end Android devices.",
    "LinkTransformer: A Unified Package for Record Linkage with Transformer Language Models": "Many computational analyses require linking information across noisy text datasets. While large language models (LLMs) offer significant promise, approximate string matching in popular statistical softwares such as R and Stata remain predominant in academic applications. These packages have simple interfaces and can be easily extended to a diversity of languages and settings, and for academic applications, ease-of-use and extensibility are essential. In contrast, packages for record linkage with LLMs require significant familiarity with deep learning frameworks and often focus on applications of commercial value in English. The open-source package LinkTransformer aims to bridge this gap by providing an end-to-end software for performing record linkage and other data cleaning tasks with transformer LLMs, treating linkage as a text retrieval problem. At its core is an off-the-shelf toolkit for applying transformer models to record linkage. LinkTransformer contains a rich repository of pre-trained models for multiple languages and supports easy integration of any transformer language model from Hugging Face or OpenAI, providing the extensibility required for many scholarly applications. Its APIs also perform common data processing tasks, e.g., aggregation, noisy de-duplication, and translation-free cross-lingual linkage. LinkTransformer contains comprehensive tools for efficient model tuning, allowing for highly customized applications, and users can easily contribute their custom-trained models to its model hub to ensure reproducibility. Using a novel benchmark dataset geared towards academic applications, we show that LinkTransformer—with both custom models and Hugging Face or OpenAI models off-the-shelf—outperforms string matching by a wide margin. By combining transformer LMs with intuitive APIs, LinkTransformer aims to democratize these performance gains for those who lack familiarity with deep learning frameworks.",
    "LIRE: Listwise Reward Enhancement for Preference Alignment": "Recently, tremendous strides have been made to align the generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values to mitigate toxic or unhelpful content. Leveraging Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) proves effective and is widely adopted by researchers. However, implementing RLHF is complex, and its sensitivity to hyperparameters renders achieving stable performance and scalability challenging. Furthermore, prevailing approaches to preference alignment primarily concentrate on pairwise comparisons, with limited exploration into multi-response scenarios, thereby overlooking the potential richness within the candidate pool. For the above reasons, we propose a new approach: Listwise Reward Enhancement for Preference Alignment (LIRE), a gradient-based reward optimization approach that incorporates the offline rewards of multiple responses into a streamlined listwise framework, thus eliminating the need for online sampling during training. LIRE is straightforward to implement, requiring minimal parameter tuning, and seamlessly aligns with the pairwise paradigm while naturally extending to multi-response scenarios. Moreover, we introduce a self-enhancement algorithm aimed at iteratively refining the reward during training. Our experiments demonstrate that LIRE consistently outperforms existing methods across several benchmarks on dialogue and summarization tasks, with good transferability to out-of-distribution data, assessed using proxy reward models and human annotators.",
    "Listen Again and Choose the Right Answer: A New Paradigm for Automatic Speech Recognition with Large Language Models": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have promoted generative error correction (GER) for automatic speech recognition (ASR), which aims to predict the ground-truth transcription from the decoded N-best hypotheses. Thanks to the strong language generation ability of LLMs and rich information in the N-best list, GER shows great effectiveness in enhancing ASR results. However, it still suffers from two limitations: 1) LLMs are unaware of the source speech during GER, which may lead to results that are grammatically correct but violate the source speech content, 2) N-best hypotheses usually only vary in a few tokens, making it redundant to send all of them for GER, which could confuse LLM about which tokens to focus on and thus lead to increased miscorrection. In this paper, we propose ClozeGER, a new paradigm for ASR generative error correction. First, we introduce a multimodal LLM (i.e., SpeechGPT) to receive source speech as extra input to improve the fidelity of correction output. Then, we reformat GER as a cloze test with logits calibration to remove the input information redundancy and simplify GER with clear instructions. Experiments show that ClozeGER achieves a new breakthrough over vanilla GER on 9 popular ASR datasets.",
    "Living in the Moment: Can Large Language Models Grasp Co-Temporal Reasoning?": "Temporal reasoning is fundamental for large language models (LLMs) to comprehend the world. Current temporal reasoning datasets are limited to questions about single or isolated events, falling short in mirroring the realistic temporal characteristics involving concurrent nature and intricate temporal interconnections. In this paper, we introduce COTEMP-QA, a comprehensive co-temporal Question Answering (QA) benchmark containing four co-temporal scenarios (Equal, Overlap, During, Mix) with 4,748 samples for evaluating the co-temporal comprehension and reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our extensive experiments reveal a significant gap between the performance of current LLMs and human-level reasoning on COTEMPQA tasks. Even when enhanced with Chain of Thought (CoT) methodologies, models consistently struggle with our task. In our preliminary exploration, we discovered that mathematical reasoning plays a significant role in handling co-temporal events and proposed a strategy to boost LLMs' co-temporal reasoning from a mathematical perspective. We hope that our COTEMPQA datasets will encourage further advancements in improving the co-temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.",
    "LLAMA PRO: Progressive LLaMA with Block Expansion": "Humans generally acquire new skills without compromising the old; however, the opposite holds for Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., from LLaMA to CodeLLaMA. To this end, we propose a new post-pretraining method for LLMs with an expansion of Transformer blocks. We tune the expanded blocks using only new corpus, efficiently and effectively improving the model's knowledge while mitigating forgetting. In this paper, we experiment on the corpus of code and math, yielding LLAMA PRO-8.3B, a versatile foundation model initialized from LLaMA2-7B, excelling in general tasks, programming, and mathematics. LLAMA PRO and its instruction-following counterpart (LLAMA PRO - INSTRUCT) achieve advanced performance among various benchmarks, demonstrating superiority over existing open models in the LLaMA family and the immense potential of reasoning and addressing diverse tasks as an intelligent agent. Our findings provide valuable insights into integrating natural and programming languages, laying a solid foundation for developing advanced language agents that operate effectively in various environments.",
    "LLaMA-Based Models for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis": "While large language models (LLMs) show promise for various tasks, their performance in compound aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) tasks lags behind fine-tuned models. However, the potential of LLMs fine-tuned for ABSA remains unexplored. This paper examines the capabilities of open-source LLMs fine-tuned for ABSA, focusing on LLaMA-based models. We evaluate the performance across four tasks and eight English datasets, finding that the fine-tuned Orca 2 model surpasses state-of-the-art results in all tasks. However, all models struggle in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios compared to fully fine-tuned ones. Additionally, we conduct error analysis to identify challenges faced by fine-tuned models.",
    "Llama2Vec: Unsupervised Adaptation of Large Language Models for Dense Retrieval": "Dense retrieval calls for discriminative embeddings to represent the semantic relationship between query and document. It may benefit from the using of large language models (LLMs), given LLMs' strong capability on semantic understanding. However, the LLMs are learned by auto-regression, whose working mechanism is completely different from representing whole text as one discriminative embedding. Thus, it is imperative to study how to adapt LLMs properly so that they can be effectively initialized as the backbone encoder for dense retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called Llama2Vec, which performs unsupervised adaptation of LLM for its dense retrieval application. Llama2Vec consists of two pretext tasks: EBAE (Embedding-Based Auto-Encoding) and EBAR (Embedding-Based Auto-Regression), where the LLM is prompted to reconstruct the input sentence and predict the next sentence based on its text embeddings. Llama2Vec is simple, lightweight, but highly effective. It is used to adapt LLaMA-2-7B on the Wikipedia corpus. With a moderate steps of adaptation, it substantially improves the model's fine-tuned performances on a variety of dense retrieval benchmarks. Notably, it results in the new state-of-the-art performances on popular benchmarks, such as passage and document retrieval on MSMARCO, and zero-shot retrieval on BEIR. The model and source code will be made publicly available to facilitate the future research. Our model is available at https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding.",
    "LLAMAFACTORY: Unified Efficient Fine-Tuning of 100+ Language Models": "Efficient fine-tuning is vital for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. However, it requires non-trivial efforts to implement these methods on different models. We present LLAMAFACTORY, a unified framework that integrates a suite of cutting-edge efficient training methods. It provides a solution for flexibly customizing the fine-tuning of 100+ LLMs without the need for coding through the built-in web UI LLAMABOARD. We empirically validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework on language modeling and text generation tasks. It has been released at https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory and received over 25,000 stars and 3,000 forks.",
    "LLaST: Improved End-to-end Speech Translation System Leveraged by Large Language Models": "We introduces LLaST, a framework for building high-performance Large Language model based Speech-to-text Translation systems. We address the limitations of end-to-end speech translation (E2E ST) models by exploring model architecture design and optimization techniques tailored for LLMs. Our approach includes LLM-based speech translation architecture design, ASR-augmented training, multilingual data augmentation, and dual-LoRA optimization. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on the CoVoST-2 benchmark and showcases exceptional scaling capabilities powered by LLMs. We believe this effective method will serve as a strong baseline for speech translation and provide insights for future improvements of the LLM-based speech translation framework.",
    "LLM as Prompter: Low-resource Inductive Reasoning on Arbitrary Knowledge Graphs": "Knowledge Graph (KG) inductive reasoning, which aims to infer missing facts from new KGs that are not seen during training, has been widely adopted in various applications. One critical challenge of KG inductive reasoning is handling low-resource scenarios with scarcity in both textual and structural aspects. In this paper, we attempt to address this challenge with Large Language Models (LLMs). Particularly, we utilize the state-of-the-art LLMs to generate a graph-structural prompt to enhance the pre-trained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which brings us new methodological insights into the KG inductive reasoning methods, as well as high generalizability in practice. On the methodological side, we introduce a novel pretraining and prompting framework PROLINK, designed for low-resource inductive reasoning across arbitrary KGs without requiring additional training. On the practical side, we experimentally evaluate our approach on 36 low-resource KG datasets and find that PROLINK outperforms previous methods in three-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot reasoning tasks, exhibiting average performance improvements by 20%, 45%, and 147%, respectively. Furthermore, PROLINK demonstrates strong robustness for various LLM promptings as well as full-shot scenarios. Our source code is available on https://github.com/KyneWang/ProLINK.",
    "LLM can Achieve Self-Regulation via Hyperparameter Aware Generation": "In the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs), users commonly employ diverse decoding strategies and adjust hyperparameters to control the generated text. However, a critical question emerges: Are LLMs conscious of the existence of these decoding strategies and capable of regulating themselves? The current decoding generation process often relies on empirical and heuristic manual adjustments to hyperparameters based on types of tasks and demands. However, this process is typically cumbersome, and the decoding hyperparameters may not always be optimal for each sample. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel text generation paradigm termed Hyperparameter Aware Generation (HAG). By leveraging hyperparameter-aware instruction tuning, the LLM autonomously determines the optimal decoding strategy and configs based on the input samples, enabling self-regulation. Our approach eliminates the need for extensive manual tuning, offering a more autonomous, self-regulate model behavior. Experimental results spanning six datasets across reasoning, creativity, translation, and mathematics tasks demonstrate that hyperparameter-aware instruction tuning empowers the LLMs to self-regulate the decoding strategy and hyperparameter. HAG extends the current paradigm in the text generation process, highlighting the feasibility of endowing the LLMs with self-regulate decoding strategies.",
    "LLM Factoscope: Uncovering LLMs' Factual Discernment through Measuring Inner States": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains with extensive knowledge and creative capabilities. However, a critical issue with LLMs is their tendency to produce outputs that diverge from factual reality. This phenomenon is particularly concerning in sensitive applications such as medical consultation and legal advice, where accuracy is paramount. Inspired by human lie detectors using physiological responses, we introduce the LLM Factoscope, a flexible and extendable pipeline that leverages the inner states of LLMs for factual detection. Our investigation reveals distinguishable patterns in LLMs' inner states when generating factual versus non-factual content. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various architectures, achieving over 96% accuracy on our custom-collected factual detection dataset. Our work opens a new avenue for utilizing LLMs' inner states for factual detection and encourages further exploration into LLMs' inner workings for enhanced reliability and transparency.",
    "LLM in a flash: Efficient Large Language Model Inference with Limited Memory": "Large language models (LLMs) are central to modern natural language processing, delivering exceptional performance in various tasks. However, their substantial computational and memory requirements present challenges, especially for devices with limited DRAM capacity. This paper tackles the challenge of efficiently running LLMs that exceed the available DRAM capacity by storing the model parameters in flash memory, but bringing them on demand to DRAM. Our method involves constructing an inference cost model that takes into account the characteristics of flash memory, guiding us to optimize in two critical areas: reducing the volume of data transferred from flash and reading data in larger, more contiguous chunks. Within this hardware-informed framework, we introduce two principal techniques. First, “windowing” strategically reduces data transfer by reusing previously activated neurons, and second, “row-column bundling”, tailored to the sequential data access strengths of flash memory, increases the size of data chunks read from flash memory. These methods collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with up to 4x and 20x increase in inference speed compared to naive loading approaches in CPU and GPU, respectively. Our integration of sparsity awareness, context-adaptive loading, and a hardware-oriented design paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory.",
    "LLM Knows Body Language, Too: Translating Speech Voices into Human Gestures": "In response to the escalating demand for digital human representations, progress has been made in the generation of realistic human gestures from given speeches. Despite the remarkable achievements of recent research, the generation process frequently includes unintended, meaningless, or non-realistic gestures. To address this challenge, we propose a gesture translation paradigm, GesTran, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to deepen the understanding of the connection between speech and gesture and sequentially generates human gestures by interpreting gestures as a unique form of body language. The primary stage of the proposed framework employs a transformer-based auto-encoder network to encode human gestures into discrete symbols. Following this, the subsequent stage utilizes a pre-trained LLM to decipher the relationship between speech and gesture, translating the speech into gesture by interpreting the gesture as unique language tokens within the LLM. Our method has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance improvement through extensive and impartial experiments conducted on public TED and TED-Expressive datasets.",
    "LLM Performance Predictors are good initializers for Architecture Search": " In this work, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for a novel use case: constructing Performance Predictors (PP) that estimate the performance of specific deep neural network architectures on downstream tasks. We create PP prompts for LLMs, comprising (i) role descriptions, (ii) instructions for the LLM, (iii) hyperparameter definitions, and (iv) demonstrations presenting sample architectures with efficiency metrics and 'training from scratch' performance. In machine translation (MT) tasks, GPT-4 with our PP prompts (LLM-PP) achieves a SoTA mean absolute error and a slight degradation in rank correlation coefficient compared to baseline predictors. Additionally, we demonstrate that predictions from LLM-PP can be distilled to a compact regression model (LLM-Distill-PP), which surprisingly retains much of the performance of LLM-PP. This presents a cost-effective alternative for resource-intensive performance estimation. Specifically, for Neural Architecture Search (NAS), we introduce a Hybrid-Search algorithm (HS-NAS) employing LLM-Distill-PP for the initial search stages and reverting to the baseline predictor later. HS-NAS performs similarly to SoTA NAS, reducing search hours by approximately 50%, and in some cases, improving latency, GFLOPs, and model size.

    "LLM-based Rewriting of Inappropriate Argumentation using Reinforcement Learning from Machine Feedback": "Ensuring that online discussions are civil and productive is a major challenge for social media platforms. Such platforms usually rely both on users and on automated detection tools to flag inappropriate arguments of other users, which moderators then review. However, this kind of post-hoc moderation is expensive and time-consuming, and moderators are often overwhelmed by the amount and severity of flagged content. Instead, a promising alternative is to prevent negative behavior during content creation. This paper studies how inappropriate language in arguments can be computationally mitigated. We propose a reinforcement learning-based rewriting approach that balances content preservation and appropriateness based on existing classifiers, prompting an instruction-finetuned large language model (LLM) as our initial policy. Unlike related style transfer tasks, rewriting inappropriate arguments allows deleting and adding content permanently. It is therefore tackled on document level rather than sentence level. We evaluate different weighting schemes for the reward function in both absolute and relative human assessment studies. Systematic experiments on non-parallel data provide evidence that our approach can mitigate the inappropriateness of arguments while largely preserving their content. It significantly outperforms competitive baselines, including few-shot learning, prompting, and humans.",
    "LLM-QAT: Data-Free Quantization Aware Training for Large Language Models": "Several post-training quantization methods have been applied to large language models (LLMs), and have been shown to perform well down to 8-bits. We find that these methods break down at lower bit precision, and investigate quantization-aware training for LLMs (LLM-QAT) to push quantization levels even further. We propose a data-free distillation method that leverages generations produced by the pre-trained model, which better preserves the original output distribution and allows quantizing any generative model independent of its training data, similar to post-training quantization methods. In addition to quantizing weights and activations, we also quantize the KV cache, which is critical for increasing throughput and supporting long sequence dependencies at current model sizes. We experiment with LLaMA models of sizes 7B, 13B, and 30B, at quantization levels down to 4-bits. We observe large improvements over training-free methods, especially in the low-bit settings.",
    "LLM-REDIAL: A Large-Scale Dataset for Conversational Recommender Systems Created from User Behaviors with LLMs": "The large-scale conversational recommendation dataset is pivotal for the development of conversational recommender systems (CRS). Most existing CRS datasets suffers from the problems of data inextensibility and semantic inconsistency. To tackle these limitations and establish a benchmark in the conversational recommendation scenario, in this paper, we introduce the LLM-REDIAL dataset to facilitate the research in CRS. LLM-REDIAL is constructed by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate the high-quality dialogues. To provide the LLMs with detailed guidance, we integrate historical user behavior data with dialogue templates that are carefully designed through the combination of multiple pre-defined goals. LLM-REDIAL has two main advantages. First, it is the largest multi-domain CRS dataset which consists of 47.6k multi-turn dialogues with 482.6k utterances across 4 domains. Second, dialogue semantics and the users' historical interaction information is highly consistent. Human evaluation are conducted to verify the quality of LLM-REDIAL. In addition, we evaluate the usability of advanced LLM-based models on LLM-REDIAL.",
    "LLM-RUBRIC: A Multidimensional, Calibrated Approach to Automated Evaluation of Natural Language Texts": "This paper introduces a framework for the automated evaluation of natural language texts. A manually constructed rubric describes how to assess multiple dimensions of interest. To evaluate a text, a large language model (LLM) is prompted with each rubric question and produces a distribution over potential responses. The LLM predictions often fail to agree well with human judges—indeed, the humans do not fully agree with one another. However, the multiple LLM distributions can be combined to predict each human judge's annotations on all questions, including a summary question that assesses overall quality or relevance. LLM-RUBRIC accomplishes this by training a small feed-forward neural network that includes both judge-specific and judge-independent parameters. When evaluating dialogue systems in a human-AI information-seeking task, we find that LLM-RUBRIC with 9 questions (assessing dimensions such as naturalness, conciseness, and citation quality) predicts human judges' assessment of overall user satisfaction, on a scale of 1-4, with RMS error ă 0.5, a 2ˆ improvement over the uncalibrated baseline.",
    "LLM2LLM: Boosting LLMs with Novel Iterative Data Enhancement": "Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are currently state-of-the-art for solving the vast majority of natural language processing tasks. While many real-world applications still require fine-tuning to reach satisfactory levels of performance, many of them are in the low-data regime, making fine-tuning challenging. To address this, we propose LLM2LLM, a targeted and iterative data augmentation strategy that uses a teacher LLM to enhance a small seed dataset by augmenting additional data that can be used for fine-tuning on a specific task. LLM2LLM (1) fine-tunes a baseline student LLM on the initial seed data, (2) evaluates and extracts data points that the model gets wrong, and (3) uses a teacher LLM to generate synthetic data based on these incorrect data points, which are then added back into the training data. This approach amplifies the signal from incorrectly predicted data points by the LLM during training and reintegrates them into the dataset to focus on more challenging examples for the LLM. Our results show that LLM2LLM significantly enhances the performance of LLMs in the low-data regime, outperforming both traditional fine-tuning and other data augmentation baselines. LLM2LLM reduces the dependence on labor-intensive data curation and paves the way for more scalable and performant LLM solutions, allowing us to tackle data-constrained domains and tasks. We achieve improvements up to 24.2% on the GSM8K dataset, 32.6% on CaseHOLD, 32.0% on SNIPS, 52.6% on TREC and 39.8% on SST-2 over regular fine-tuning in the low-data regime using a Llama-2-7B student model.

    "LLMARENA: Assessing Capabilities of Large Language Models in Dynamic Multi-Agent Environments": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revealed their potential for achieving autonomous agents possessing human-level intelligence. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM Agents either use static datasets, potentially leading to data leakage, or focus only on single-agent scenarios, overlooking the complexities of multi-agent interactions. There is a lack of a benchmark that evaluates the diverse capabilities of LLM agents in multi-agent, dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce LLMARENA, a novel and easily extensible framework for evaluating the diverse capabilities of LLM in multi-agent dynamic environments. LLMARENA encompasses seven distinct gaming environments, employing TrueSkill™ scoring to assess crucial abilities in LLM agents, including spatial reasoning, strategic planning, numerical reasoning, risk assessment, communication, opponent modeling, and team collaboration. We conduct an extensive experiment and human evaluation among different sizes and types of LLMs, showing that LLMs still have a significant journey ahead in their development towards becoming fully autonomous agents, especially in opponent modeling and team collaboration. We hope LLMARENA could guide future research towards enhancing these capabilities in LLMs, ultimately leading to more sophisticated and practical applications in dynamic, multi-agent settings. The code is available in https://github.com/THU-BPM/LLMArena.",
    "LLMBox: A Comprehensive Library for Large Language Models": "To facilitate the research on large language models (LLMs), this paper presents a comprehensive and unified library, LLMBox, to ease the development, use, and evaluation of LLMs. This library is featured with three main merits: (1) a unified data interface that supports the flexible implementation of various training strategies, (2) a comprehensive evaluation that covers extensive tasks, datasets, and models, and (3) more practical consideration, especially on user-friendliness and efficiency. With our library, users can easily reproduce existing methods, train new models, and conduct comprehensive performance comparisons.

    "LLMCRIT: Teaching Large Language Models to Use Criteria": "Humans follow criteria when they execute tasks, and these criteria are directly used to assess the quality of task completion. Therefore, having models learn to use criteria to provide feedback can help humans or models to perform tasks better. However, current research in this area tends to consider only a limited number of criteria, or only a limited number of quality assessment aspects. To fill this gap, we propose a general framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to use comprehensive criteria for a task in delivering natural language feedback on task execution. In particular, we present a model-in-the-loop framework that semi-automatically derives criteria from collected guidelines for different writing tasks and constructs in-context demonstrations for each criterion. We choose three tasks from real-world scenarios to operationalize this idea: paper introduction writing, Python code writing, and Reddit post writing, and evaluate our feedback generation framework using different LLMs. The results reveal the fine-grained effects of adding criteria and demonstrations and provide valuable guidance on how to teach LLMs to use criteria more effectively.",
    "LLMEmbed: Rethinking Lightweight LLM's Genuine Function in Text Classification": "With the booming of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt-learning has become a promising method mainly researched in various research areas. Recently, many attempts based on prompt-learning have been made to improve the performance of text classification. However, most of these methods are based on heuristic Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and tend to be more complex but less efficient. In this paper, we rethink the LLM-based text classification methodology, propose a simple and effective transfer learning strategy, namely LLMEmbed, to address this classical but challenging task. To illustrate, we first study how to properly extract and fuse the text embeddings via various lightweight LLMs at different network depths to improve their robustness and discrimination, then adapt such embeddings to train the classifier. We perform extensive experiments on publicly available datasets, and the results show that LLMEmbed achieves strong performance while enjoys low training overhead using lightweight LLM backbones compared to recent methods based on larger LLMs, i.e., GPT-3, and sophisticated prompt-based strategies. Our LLMEmbed achieves adequate accuracy on publicly available benchmarks without any fine-tuning while merely use 4% model parameters, 1.8% electricity consumption and 1.5% runtime compared to its counterparts.",
    "LLMFactor: Extracting Profitable Factors through Prompts for Explainable Stock Movement Prediction": "Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention for their exceptional performance across a broad range of tasks, particularly in text analysis. However, the finance sector presents a distinct challenge due to its dependence on time-series data for complex forecasting tasks. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called LLMFactor, which employs Sequential Knowledge-Guided Prompting (SKGP) to identify factors that influence stock movements using LLMs. Unlike previous methods that relied on keyphrases or sentiment analysis, this approach focuses on extracting factors more directly related to stock market dynamics, providing clear explanations for complex temporal changes. Our framework directs the LLMs to create background knowledge through a fill-in-the-blank strategy and then discerns potential factors affecting stock prices from related news. Guided by background knowledge and identified factors, we leverage historical stock prices in textual format to predict stock movement. An extensive evaluation of the LLMFactor framework across four benchmark datasets from both the U.S. and Chinese stock markets demonstrates its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods and its effectiveness in financial time-series forecasting.",
    "LLMLingua-2: Data Distillation for Efficient and Faithful Task-Agnostic Prompt Compression": "This paper focuses on task-agnostic prompt compression for better generalizability and efficiency. Considering the redundancy in natural language, existing approaches compress prompts by removing tokens or lexical units according to their information entropy obtained from a causal language model such as LLaMa-7B. The challenge is that information entropy may be a suboptimal compression metric: (i) it only leverages unidirectional context and may fail to capture all essential information needed for prompt compression; (ii) it is not aligned with the prompt compression objective. To address these issues, we propose a data distillation procedure to derive knowledge from an LLM to compress prompts without losing crucial information, and meantime, introduce an extractive text compression dataset. We formulate prompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee the faithfulness of the compressed prompt to the original one, and use a Transformer encoder as the base architecture to capture all essential information for prompt compression from the full bidirectional context. Our approach leads to lower latency by explicitly learning the compression objective with smaller models such as XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT. We evaluate our method on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, including Meeting-Bank, LongBench, ZeroScrolls, GSM8K, and BBH. Despite its small size, our model shows significant performance gains over strong baselines and demonstrates robust generalization ability across different LLMs. Additionally, our model is 3x-6x faster than existing prompt compression methods, while accelerating the end-to-end latency by 1.6x-2.9x with compression ratios of 2x-5x.",
    "LLMs as Narcissistic Evaluators: When Ego Inflates Evaluation Scores": "Automatic evaluation of generated textual content presents an ongoing challenge within the field of NLP. Given the impressive capabilities of modern language models (LMs) across diverse NLP tasks, there is a growing trend to employ these models in creating innovative evaluation metrics for automated assessment of generation tasks. This paper investigates a pivotal question: Do language model-driven evaluation metrics inherently exhibit bias favoring texts generated by the same underlying language model? Specifically, we assess whether prominent LM-based evaluation metrics (e.g., BARTScore, T5Score, and GPTScore) demonstrate a favorable bias toward their respective underlying LMs in the context of summarization tasks. Our findings unveil a latent bias, particularly pronounced when such evaluation metrics are used in a reference-free manner without leveraging gold summaries. These results underscore that assessments provided by generative evaluation models can be influenced by factors beyond the inherent text quality, highlighting the necessity of developing more reliable evaluation protocols in the future.",
    "LLMs Beyond English: Scaling the Multilingual Capability of LLMs with Cross-Lingual Feedback": "To democratize large language models (LLMs) to most natural languages, it is imperative to make these models capable of understanding and generating texts in many languages, in particular low-resource ones. While recent multilingual LLMs demonstrate remarkable performance in such capabilities, these LLMs still support a limited number of human languages due to the lack of training data for low-resource languages. Moreover, these LLMs are not yet aligned with human preference for downstream tasks, which is crucial for the success of LLMs in English. In this paper, we introduce xLLaMA-100 and xBLOOM-100 (collectively xLLMs-100), which scale the multilingual capabilities of LLaMA and BLOOM to 100 languages. To do so, we construct two datasets: a multilingual instruction dataset including 100 languages, which represents the largest language coverage to date, and a cross-lingual human feedback dataset encompassing 30 languages. We perform multilingual instruction tuning on the constructed instruction data and further align the LLMs with human feedback using the DPO algorithm on our cross-lingual human feedback dataset. We evaluate the multilingual understanding and generating capabilities of xLLMs-100 on five multilingual benchmarks. Experimental results show that xLLMs-100 consistently outperforms its peers across the benchmarks by considerable margins, defining a new state-of-the-art multilingual LLM that supports 100 languages.",
    "LLMs cannot find reasoning errors, but can correct them given the error location": "While self-correction has shown promise in improving LLM outputs in terms of style and quality (e.g. Chen et al., 2023b; Madaan et al., 2023), recent attempts to self-correct logical or reasoning errors often cause correct answers to become incorrect, resulting in worse performances overall (Huang et al., 2023). In this paper, we show that poor self-correction performance stems from LLMs' inability to find logical mistakes, rather than their ability to correct a known mistake. Firstly, we benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs on their mistake-finding ability and demonstrate that they generally struggle with the task, even in highly objective, unambiguous cases. Secondly, we test the correction abilities of LLMs - separately from mistake finding - using a backtracking setup that feeds ground truth mistake location information to the model. We show that this boosts downstream task performance across our 5 reasoning tasks, indicating that LLMs' correction abilities are robust. Finally, we show that it is possible to obtain mistake location information without ground truth labels or in-domain training data. We train a small classifier with out-of-domain data, which exhibits stronger mistake-finding performance than prompting a large model. We release our dataset of LLM-generated logical mistakes, BIG-Bench Mistake, to enable further research into locating LLM reasoning mistakes.",
    "LLMs for Targeted Sentiment in News Headlines: Exploring the Descriptive-Prescriptive Dilemma": "News headlines often evoke sentiment by intentionally portraying entities in particular ways, making targeted sentiment analysis (TSA) of headlines a worthwhile but difficult task. Due to its subjectivity, creating TSA datasets can involve various annotation paradigms, from descriptive to prescriptive, either encouraging or limiting subjectivity. LLMs are a good fit for TSA due to their broad linguistic and world knowledge and in-context learning abilities, yet their performance depends on prompt design. In this paper, we compare the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs and fine-tuned encoder models for TSA of news headlines using descriptive and prescriptive datasets across several languages. Exploring the descriptive-prescriptive continuum, we analyze how performance is affected by prompt prescriptiveness, ranging from plain zero-shot to elaborate few-shot prompts. Finally, we evaluate the ability of LLMs to quantify uncertainty via calibration error and comparison to human label variation. We find that LLMs outperform fine-tuned encoders on descriptive datasets, while calibration and F1-score generally improve with increased prescriptiveness, yet the optimal level varies.",
    "LLMs in the Imaginarium: Tool Learning through Simulated Trial and Error": "Tools are essential for large language models (LLMs) to acquire up-to-date information and take consequential actions in external environments. Existing work on tool-augmented LLMs primarily focuses on the broad coverage of tools and the flexibility of adding new tools. However, a critical aspect that has surprisingly been understudied is simply how accurately an LLM uses tools for which it has been trained. We find that existing LLMs, including GPT-4 and open-source LLMs specifically fine-tuned for tool use, only reach a correctness rate in the range of 30% to 60%, far from reliable use in practice. We propose a biologically inspired method for tool-augmented LLMs, simulated trial and error (STE), that orchestrates three key mechanisms for successful tool use behaviors in the biological system: trial and error, imagination, and memory. Specifically, STE leverages an LLM's 'imagination' to simulate plausible scenarios for using a tool, after which the LLM interacts with the tool to learn from its execution feedback. Both short-term and long-term memory are employed to improve the depth and breadth of the exploration, respectively. Comprehensive experiments on Tool-Bench show that STE substantially improves tool learning for LLMs under both in-context learning and fine-tuning settings, bringing a boost of 46.7% to Mistral-Instruct-7B and enabling it to outperform GPT-4. We also show effective continual learning of tools via a simple experience replay strategy.",
    "LLMs Learn Task Heuristics from Demonstrations: A Heuristic-Driven Prompting Strategy for Document-Level Event Argument Extraction": "In this study, we explore in-context learning (ICL) in document-level event argument extraction (EAE) to alleviate the dependency on large-scale labeled data for this task. We introduce the Heuristic-Driven Link-of-Analogy (HD-LoA) prompting tailored for the EAE task. Specifically, we hypothesize and validate that LLMs learn task-specific heuristics from demonstrations in ICL. Building upon this hypothesis, we introduce an explicit heuristic-driven demonstration construction approach, which transforms the haphazard example selection process into a systematic method that emphasizes task heuristics. Additionally, inspired by the analogical reasoning of human, we propose the link-of-analogy prompting, which enables LLMs to process new situations by drawing analogies to known situations, enhancing their performance on unseen classes beyond limited ICL examples. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing prompting methods and few-shot supervised learning methods on document-level EAE datasets. Additionally, the HD-LoA prompting shows effectiveness in other tasks like sentiment analysis and natural language inference, demonstrating its broad adaptability.",
    "LLMs' morphological analyses of complex FST-generated Finnish words": "Rule-based language processing systems have been overshadowed by neural systems in terms of utility, but it remains unclear whether neural NLP systems, in practice, learn the grammar rules that humans use. This work aims to shed light on the issue by evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs in a task of morphological analysis of complex Finnish noun forms. We generate the forms using an FST tool, and they are unlikely to have occurred in the training sets of the LLMs, therefore requiring morphological generalisation capacity. We find that GPT-4-turbo has some difficulties in the task while GPT-3.5-turbo struggles and smaller models Llama2-70B and Poro-34B fail nearly completely.",
    "LM Transparency Tool: Interactive Tool for Analyzing Transformer Language Models": "We present the LM Transparency Tool (LM-TT), an open-source interactive toolkit for analyzing the internal workings of Transformer-based language models. Differently from previously existing tools that focus on isolated parts of the decision-making process, our framework is designed to make the entire prediction process transparent, and allows tracing back model behavior from the top-layer representation to very fine-grained parts of the model. Specifically, it (i) shows the important part of the whole input-to-output information flow, (ii) allows attributing any changes done by a model block to individual attention heads and feed-forward neurons, (iii) allows interpreting the functions of those heads or neurons. A crucial part of this pipeline is showing the importance of specific model components at each step. As a result, we are able to look at the roles of model components only in cases where they are important for a prediction. Since knowing which components should be inspected is key for analyzing large models where the number of these components is extremely high, we believe our tool will greatly support the interpretability community both in research settings and in practical applications.",
    "LM-Cocktail: Resilient Tuning of Language Models via Model Merging": "The pre-trained language models are continually fine-tuned to better support downstream applications. However, this operation may result in significant performance degeneration on general tasks beyond the targeted domain. To overcome this problem, we propose LM-Cocktail which enables the fine-tuned model to stay resilient in general perspectives. Our method is conducted in the form of model merging, where the fine-tuned language model is merged with the pre-trained base model or the peer models from other domains through weighted average. Despite simplicity, LM-Cocktail is surprisingly effective: the resulted model is able to achieve a strong empirical performance in the whole scope of general tasks while preserving a superior capacity in its targeted domain. We conduct comprehensive experiments with LLama and BGE models on popular benchmarks, including FLAN, MMLU, MTEB, whose results validate the efficacy of our proposed method.",
    "LMDX: Language Model-based Document Information Extraction and Localization": "Large Language Models (LLM) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP), improving state-of-the-art and exhibiting emergent capabilities across various tasks. However, their application in extracting information from visually rich documents, which is at the core of many document processing workflows and involving the extraction of key entities from semi-structured documents, has not yet been successful. The main obstacles to adopting LLMs for this task include the absence of layout encoding within LLMs, which is critical for high quality extraction, and the lack of a grounding mechanism to localize the predicted entities within the document. In this paper, we introduce Language Model-based Document Information EXtraction and Localization (LMDX), a methodology to reframe the document information extraction task for a LLM. LMDX enables extraction of singular, repeated, and hierarchical entities, both with and without training data, while providing grounding guarantees and localizing the entities within the document. Finally, we apply LMDX to the PaLM 2-S and Gemini Pro LLMs and evaluate it on VRDU and CORD benchmarks, setting a new state-of-the-art and showing how LMDX enables the creation of high quality, data-efficient parsers.",
    "LOCALRQA: From Generating Data to Locally Training, Testing, and Deploying Retrieval-Augmented QA Systems": "Retrieval-augmented question-answering systems combine retrieval techniques with large language models to provide answers that are more accurate and informative. Many existing toolkits allow users to quickly build such systems using off-the-shelf models, but they fall short in supporting researchers and developers to customize the model training, testing, and deployment process. We propose LOCALRQA, an open-source toolkit that features a wide selection of model training algorithms, evaluation methods, and deployment tools curated from the latest research. As a showcase, we build QA systems using online documentation obtained from Databricks and Faire's websites. We find 7B-models trained and deployed using LOCALRQA reach a similar performance compared to using OpenAI's text-ada-002 and GPT-4-turbo.",
    "Locating and Extracting Relational Concepts in Large Language Models": "Relational concepts are indeed foundational to the structure of knowledge representation, as they facilitate the association between various entity concepts, allowing us to express and comprehend complex world knowledge. By expressing relational concepts in natural language prompts, people can effortlessly interact with large language models (LLMs) and recall desired factual knowledge. However, the process of knowledge recall lacks interpretability, and representations of relational concepts within LLMs remain unknown to us. In this paper, we identify hidden states that can express entity and relational concepts through causal mediation analysis in fact recall processes. Our finding reveals that at the last token position of the input prompt, there are hidden states that solely express the causal effects of relational concepts. Based on this finding, we assume that these hidden states can be treated as relational representations and we can successfully extract them from LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate high credibility of the relational representations: they can be flexibly transplanted into other fact recall processes, and can also be used as robust entity connectors. Moreover, we also show that the relational representations exhibit significant potential for controllable fact recall through relation rewriting.",
    "LOGIC-LM++: Multi-Step Refinement for Symbolic Formulations": "In this paper we examine the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning tasks. Although recent works have started to employ formal languages as an intermediate representation for reasoning tasks, they often face challenges in accurately generating and refining these formal specifications to ensure correctness. To address these issues, this paper proposes Logic-LM++, an improvement on Logic-LM (Pan et al., 2023). It uses the ability of LLMs to do pairwise comparisons, allowing the evaluation of the refinements suggested by the LLM. The paper demonstrates that Logic-LM++ outperforms Logic-LM and other contemporary techniques across natural language reasoning tasks on three datasets, FOLIO, ProofWriter and AR-LSAT, with an average improvement of 18.5% on standard prompting, 12.3% on chain of thought prompting and 5% on Logic-LM.",
    "Logical Closed Loop: Uncovering Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models": "Object hallucination has been an Achilles' heel which hinders the broader applications of large vision-language models (LVLMs). Object hallucination refers to the phenomenon that the LVLMs claim non-existent objects in the image. To mitigate the object hallucinations, instruction tuning and external model-based detection methods have been proposed, which either require large-scale computational resources or depend on the detection result of external models. However, there remains an under-explored field to utilize the LVLM itself to alleviate object hallucinations. In this work, we adopt the intuition that the LVLM tends to respond logically consistently for existent objects but inconsistently for hallucinated objects. Therefore, we propose a Logical Closed Loop-based framework for Object Hallucination Detection and Mitigation, namely LogicCheckGPT. In specific, we devise logical consistency probing to raise questions with logical correlations, inquiring about attributes from objects and vice versa. Whether their responses can form a logical closed loop serves as an indicator of object hallucination. As a plug-and-play method, it can be seamlessly applied to all existing LVLMs. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three benchmarks across four LVLMs have demonstrated significant improvements brought by our method, indicating its effectiveness and generality.",
    "LogicBench: Towards Systematic Evaluation of Logical Reasoning Ability of Large Language Models": "Recently developed large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform remarkably well on a wide range of language understanding tasks. But, can they really “reason” over the natural language? This question has been receiving significant research attention and many reasoning skills such as common-sense, numerical, and qualitative have been studied. However, the crucial skill pertaining to 'logical reasoning' has remained underexplored. Existing work investigating this reasoning ability of LLMs has focused only on a couple of inference rules (such as modus ponens and modus tollens) of propositional and first-order logic. Addressing the above limitation, we comprehensively evaluate the logical reasoning ability of LLMs on 25 different reasoning patterns spanning over propositional, first-order, and non-monotonic logics. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce LogicBench, a natural language question-answering dataset focusing on the use of a single inference rule. We conduct detailed analysis with a range of LLMs such as GPT-4, ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama-2, and Mistral using chain-of-thought prompting. Experimental results show that existing LLMs do not fare well on LogicBench; especially, they struggle with instances involving complex reasoning and negations. Furthermore, they sometimes overlook contextual information necessary for reasoning to arrive at the correct conclusion. We believe that our work and findings facilitate future research for evaluating and enhancing the logical reasoning ability of LLMs.",
    "Long Context is Not Long at All: A Prospector of Long-Dependency Data for Large Language Models": "Long-context modeling capabilities are important for large language models (LLMs) in various applications. However, directly training LLMs with long context windows is insufficient to enhance this capability since some training samples do not exhibit strong semantic dependencies across long contexts. In this study, we propose a data mining framework ProLong1 that can assign each training sample with a long dependency score, which can be used to rank and filter samples that are more advantageous for enhancing long-context modeling abilities in LLM training. Specifically, we first use delta perplexity scores to measure the Dependency Strength between text segments in a given document. Then, we refine this metric based on the Dependency Distance of these segments to incorporate spatial relationships across long contexts. Final results are calibrated with a Dependency Specificity metric to prevent trivial dependencies introduced by repetitive patterns. Moreover, a random sampling approach is proposed to optimize the computational efficiency of ProLong. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks indicate that ProLong effectively identifies documents that carry long dependencies, and LLMs trained on these documents exhibit significantly enhanced long-context modeling capabilities.",
    "Long Unit Word Tokenization and Bunsetsu Segmentation of Historical Japanese": "In Japanese, “bunsetsu” is the natural minimal phrase of a sentence; it serves as a natural boundary of a sentence for native speakers rather than words, and thus grammatical analysis in Japanese linguistics commonly operates on the basis of bunsetsu units. By contrast, because Japanese does not have delimiters between words, there are two major categories of word definitions: Short Unit Words (SUWs) and Long Unit Words (LUWs). SUW dictionaries are available, whereas LUW dictionaries are not. Hence, this study focuses on providing deep learning-based (or LLM-based) bunsetsu and LUWs parser for the Heian period (AD 794-1185) and evaluating its performances. We model the parser as a transformer-based joint sequential labels model that combines the bunsetsu BI tag, LUW BI tag, and LUW Part-of-Speech (POS) tag for each SUW token. We trained our models on the corpora of each period including contemporary and historical Japanese. The results ranged from 0.976 to 0.996 in the f1 value for both bunsetsu and LUW reconstruction indicating that our models achieved comparable performance with models for a contemporary Japanese corpus. Through statistical analysis and a diachronic case study, it was found that the estimation of bunsetsu could be influenced by the grammaticalization of morphemes.",
    "Long-Context Language Modeling with Parallel Context Encoding": "Extending large language models (LLMs) to process longer inputs is crucial for a wide range of applications. However, the substantial computational cost of transformers and limited generalization of positional encoding restrict the size of their context window. We introduce Context Expansion with Parallel Encoding (CEPE), a framework that can be applied to any existing decoder-only LLMs to extend their context window. CEPE employs a small encoder to process long inputs chunk by chunk, enabling the frozen decoder to utilize additional contexts via cross-attention. CEPE is efficient, generalizable, and versatile: trained with 8K-token documents, it extends the context window of LLAMA-2 to 128K tokens, offering 10× the throughput with only 1/6 of the memory. CEPE yields strong performance on language modeling and in-context learning. CEPE also excels in retrieval-augmented applications, while existing long-context models degenerate with retrieved contexts. We further introduce a CEPE variant that can extend the context window of instruction-tuned models using only unlabeled data, and showcase its effectiveness on LLAMA-2-CHAT, leading to a strong instruction-following model that can leverage very long contexts on downstream tasks.",
    "LongBench: A Bilingual, Multitask Benchmark for Long Context Understanding": "Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance for many language tasks, most of them can only handle texts a few thousand tokens long, limiting their applications on longer sequence inputs, such as books, reports, and codebases. Recent works have proposed methods to improve LLMs' long context capabilities by extending context windows and more sophisticated memory mechanisms. However, comprehensive benchmarks tailored for evaluating long context understanding are lacking. In this paper, we introduce LongBench, the first bilingual, multi-task benchmark for long context understanding, enabling a more rigorous evaluation of long context understanding. LongBench comprises 21 datasets across 6 task categories in both English and Chinese, with an average length of 6,711 words (English) and 13,386 characters (Chinese). These tasks cover key long-text application areas including single-doc QA, multi-doc QA, summarization, few-shot learning, synthetic tasks, and code completion. All datasets in LongBench are standardized into a unified format, allowing for effortless automatic evaluation of LLMs. Upon comprehensive evaluation of 8 LLMs on LongBench, we find that: (1) Commercial model (GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k) outperforms other open-sourced models, but still struggles on longer contexts. (2) Scaled position embedding and fine-tuning on longer sequences lead to substantial improvement on long context understanding. (3) Context compression technique such as retrieval brings improvement for model with weak ability on long contexts, but the performance still lags behind models that have strong long context understanding capability.",
    "LongLLMLingua: Accelerating and Enhancing LLMs in Long Context Scenarios via Prompt Compression": "In long context scenarios, large language models (LLMs) face three main challenges: higher computational cost, performance reduction, and position bias. Research indicates that LLM performance hinges on the density and position of key information in the input prompt. Inspired by these findings, we propose LongLLMLingua for prompt compression towards improving LLMs' perception of the key information to simultaneously address the three challenges. Our extensive evaluation across various long context scenarios demonstrates that LongLLMLingua not only enhances performance but also significantly reduces costs and latency. For instance, in the NaturalQuestions benchmark, LongLLMLingua boosts performance by up to 21.4% with around 4x fewer tokens in GPT-3.5-Turbo, leading to substantial cost savings. It achieves a 94.0% cost reduction in the LooGLE benchmark. Moreover, when compressing prompts of about 10k tokens at ratios of 2x-6x, LongLLMLingua can accelerate end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.6x.",
    "Looking Right is Sometimes Right: Investigating the Capabilities of Decoder-only LLMs for Sequence Labeling": "Pre-trained language models based on masked language modeling (MLM) excel in natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. While fine-tuned MLM-based encoders consistently outperform causal language modeling decoders of comparable size, recent decoder-only large language models (LLMs) perform on par with smaller MLM-based encoders. Although their performance improves with scale, LLMs fall short of achieving state-of-the-art results in information extraction (IE) tasks, many of which are formulated as sequence labeling (SL). We hypothesize that LLMs' poor SL performance stems from causal masking, which prevents the model from attending to tokens on the right of the current token. Yet, how exactly and to what extent LLMs' performance on SL can be improved remains unclear. We explore techniques for improving the SL performance of open LLMs on IE tasks by applying layer-wise removal of the causal mask (CM) during LLM fine-tuning. This approach yields performance gains competitive with state-of-the-art SL models, matching or outperforming the results of CM removal from all blocks. Our findings hold for diverse SL tasks, demonstrating that open LLMs with layer-dependent CM removal outperform strong MLM-based encoders and even instruction-tuned LLMs.",
    "LoRA Meets Dropout under a Unified Framework": "With the remarkable capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as essential elements in numerous NLP applications, while parameter-efficient finetuning, especially LoRA, has gained popularity as a lightweight approach for model customization. Meanwhile, various dropout methods, initially designed for full finetuning with all the parameters updated, alleviates overfitting associated with excessive parameter redundancy. Hence, a possible contradiction arises from negligible trainable parameters of LoRA and the effectiveness of previous dropout methods, which has been largely overlooked. To fill this gap, we first confirm that parameter-efficient LoRA is also overfitting-prone. We then revisit transformer-specific dropout methods, and establish their equivalence and distinctions mathematically and empirically. Building upon this comparative analysis, we introduce a unified framework for a comprehensive investigation, which instantiates these methods based on dropping position, structural pattern and compensation measure. Through this framework, we reveal the new preferences and performance comparisons of them when involved with limited trainable parameters. This framework also allows us to amalgamate the most favorable aspects into a novel dropout method named HiddenKey. Extensive experiments verify the remarkable superiority and sufficiency of HiddenKey across multiple models and tasks, which highlights it as the preferred approach for high-performance and parameter-efficient finetuning of LLMs.",
    "LoRA-Flow: Dynamic LoRA Fusion for Large Language Models in Generative Tasks": "LoRA employs lightweight modules to customize large language models (LLMs) for each downstream task or domain, where different learned additional modules represent diverse skills. Combining existing LoRA modules to address new tasks can enhance the reusability of learned LoRA modules, particularly beneficial for tasks with limited annotated data. Most prior works on LoRA combination primarily rely on task-level weights for each involved LoRA, making different examples and tokens share the same LoRA weights. However, in generative tasks, different tokens may necessitate diverse skills to manage. Taking the Chinese math task as an example, understanding the problem description may depend more on the Chinese LoRA, while the calculation part may rely more on the math LoRA. To this end, we propose LoRA-Flow, which utilizes dynamic weights to adjust the impact of different LoRA modules. The weights at each step are determined by a fusion gate with extremely few parameters, which can be learned with only 200 training examples. Experiments across six generative tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines with task-level fusion weights. This underscores the necessity of introducing dynamic fusion weights for LoRA combination.",
    "LoRAMoE: Alleviating World Knowledge Forgetting in Large Language Models via MoE-Style Plugin": "Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a crucial step for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to align with human instructions and enhance their capabilities in downstream tasks. Substantially increasing instruction data is a direct solution to align the model with a broader range of downstream tasks or notably improve its performance on a specific task. However, we find that large-scale increases in instruction data can damage the world knowledge previously stored in LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose LoRAMoE, a novel framework that introduces several low-rank adapters (LoRA) and integrates them by using a router network, like a plugin version of Mixture of Experts (MoE). It freezes the backbone model and forces a portion of LoRAs to focus on leveraging world knowledge to solve downstream tasks, to alleviate world knowledge forgetting. Experimental results show that, as the instruction data increases, LoRAMoE can significantly improve the ability to process downstream tasks, while maintaining the world knowledge stored in the LLM.",
    "LoRAPrune: Structured Pruning Meets Low-Rank Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as LLaMA and T5, have shown exceptional performance across various tasks through fine-tuning. Although low-rank adaption (LoRA) has emerged to cheaply fine-tune these LLMs on downstream tasks, their deployment is still hindered by the vast model scale and computational costs. Post-training model pruning offers a way to compress LLMs. However, the current pruning methods designed for LLMs are not compatible with LoRA. This is due to their utilization of unstructured pruning on LLMs, impeding the merging of LoRA weights, or their dependence on the gradients of pre-trained weights to guide pruning, which can impose significant memory overhead. To this end, we propose LoRAPrune, a new framework that delivers an accurate structured pruned model in a highly memory-efficient manner. Specifically, we first design a LoRA-guided pruning criterion, which uses the weights and gradients of LoRA, rather than the gradients of pre-trained weights for importance estimation. We subsequently integrate this criterion into an iterative pruning process, effectively removing redundant channels and heads. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our LoRAPrune over existing approaches on the LLaMA series models. At a 50% compression rate, LoRAPrune demonstrates superior performance over LLM-Pruner, achieving a reduction in perplexity by 4.81 on WikiText2 and 3.46 on PTB, while also decreasing memory usage by 52.6%. Besides, LoRAPrune also matches semi-structural pruning across multiple LLMs, proving its wide applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/LoRAPrune.",
    "LoraRetriever: Input-Aware LoRA Retrieval and Composition for Mixed Tasks in the Wild": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) provides an effective yet efficient solution for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). The modular and plug-and-play nature of LoRA enables the integration of diverse domain-specific LoRAs to enhance the capabilities of LLMs. Previous research on exploiting multiple LoRAs either focuses on specific isolated downstream tasks or fixes the selection of LoRAs during training. However, in real-world scenarios, LLMs receive diverse prompts covering different tasks, and the pool of candidate LoRAs is often dynamically updated. To bridge this gap, we propose LoraRetriever, a retrieve-then-compose framework that adaptively retrieves and composes multiple LoRAs according to the input prompts. LoraRetriever contains three main components: firstly, identifying and retrieving LoRAs relevant to the given input; secondly, formulating strategies for effectively integrating the retrieved LoRAs; and thirdly, developing efficient batch inference to accommodate heterogeneous requests. Experimental results indicate that LoraRetriever consistently outperforms the baselines, highlighting its practical effectiveness and versatility.",
    "Lost in the Source Language: How Large Language Models Evaluate the Quality of Machine Translation": "This study investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage source and reference data in machine translation evaluation task, aiming to better understand the mechanisms behind their remarkable performance in this task. We design the controlled experiments across various input modes and model types, and employ both coarse-grained and fine-grained prompts to discern the utility of source versus reference information. We find that reference information significantly enhances the evaluation accuracy, while surprisingly, source information sometimes is counterproductive, indicating LLMs' inability to fully leverage the cross-lingual capability when evaluating translations. Further analysis of the fine-grained evaluation and fine-tuning experiments show similar results. These findings also suggest a potential research direction for LLMs that fully exploits the cross-lingual capability of LLMs to achieve better performance in machine translation evaluation tasks.",
    "Low-Resource Cross-Lingual Summarization through Few-Shot Learning with Large Language Models": "Cross-lingual summarization (XLS) aims to generate a summary in a target language different from the source language document. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising zero-shot XLS performance, their few-shot capabilities on this task remain unexplored, especially for low-resource languages with limited parallel data. In this paper, we investigate the few-shot XLS performance of various models, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our experiments demonstrate that few-shot learning significantly improves the XLS performance of LLMs, particularly GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in low-resource settings. However, the open-source model Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 struggles to adapt effectively to the XLS task with limited examples. Our findings highlight the potential of few-shot learning for improving XLS performance and the need for further research in designing LLM architectures and pre-training objectives tailored for this task. We provide a future work direction to explore more effective few-shot learning strategies and to investigate the transfer learning capabilities of LLMs for cross-lingual summarization.",
    "LPNL: Scalable Link Prediction with Large Language Models": "Exploring the application of large language models (LLMs) to graph learning is an emerging endeavor. However, the vast amount of information inherent in large graphs poses significant challenges to graph learning with LLMs. This work focuses on the link prediction task and introduces LPNL (Link Prediction via Natural Language), a framework based on large language models designed for scalable link prediction on large-scale heterogeneous graphs. We design novel prompts for link prediction that articulate graph details in natural language. We propose a two-stage sampling pipeline to extract crucial information from the graphs, and a divide-and-conquer strategy to control the input tokens within predefined limits, addressing the challenge of overwhelming information. We fine-tune a T5 model based on our self-supervised learning designed for link prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LPNL outperforms multiple advanced baselines in link prediction tasks on large-scale graphs.",
    "LRQuant: Learnable and Robust Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) for large language models (LLMs) significantly accelerates model inference and relieves memory constraints, without incurring model training. A “smoothing paradigm” is commonly used in LLM quantization, which transfers the quantization difficulty of activation to weight quantization using mathematically equivalent transformations. However, existing methods face two issues: 1) Most smoothing parameters are hand-crafted defined which leads to sub-optimal results; 2) There are significant performance degradations when tested on unseen datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a robust learnable smooth-based PTQ framework, called LRQuant. Firstly, we consider a learnable paradigm to find optimal smoothing parameters which are initialized by logarithmic activation equivalent. In addition, we empirically found that only relying on MSE loss could hardly lead to optimal quantization results, and we then propose a novel loss function based on the negative logarithm of cosine similarity (NLC loss) between outputs of full-precision and quantized block. At last, we pioneeringly introduce Test-time adaptation (TTA) into LLM quantization, which allows for rapid model adaptation during testing to improve generalization performance. More surprisingly, we find that by using our TTA method, we can achieve better results on test sets than directly using test sets for calibration in some cases while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Codes are available at https://github.com/zjq0455/RLQ.",
    "LSTPrompt: Large Language Models as Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters by Long-Short-Term Prompting": "Time-series forecasting (TSF) finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Prompting off-the-shelf Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates strong zero-shot TSF capabilities while preserving computational efficiency. However, existing prompting methods oversimplify TSF as language next-token predictions, overlooking its dynamic nature and lack of integration with state-of-the-art prompt strategies such as Chain-of-Thought. Thus, we propose LSTPrompt, a novel approach for prompting LLMs in zero-shot TSF tasks. LSTPrompt decomposes TSF into short-term and long-term forecasting sub-tasks, tailoring prompts to each. LSTPrompt guides LLMs to regularly reassess forecasting mechanisms to enhance adaptability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate consistently better performance of LSTPrompt than existing prompting methods, and competitive results compared to foundation TSF models.",
    "M-QALM: A Benchmark to Assess Clinical Reading Comprehension and Knowledge Recall in Large Language Models via Question Answering": "There is vivid research on adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform a variety of tasks in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. Despite their popularity, there is a lack of understanding of the extent and contributing factors that allow LLMs to recall relevant knowledge and combine it with presented information in the clinical and biomedical domain—a fundamental pre-requisite for success on downstream tasks. Addressing this gap, we use Multiple Choice and Abstractive Question Answering to conduct a large-scale empirical study on 22 datasets in three generalist and three specialist biomedical sub-domains. Our multifaceted analysis of the performance of 15 LLMs, further broken down by sub-domain, source of knowledge and model architecture, uncovers success factors such as instruction tuning that lead to improved recall and comprehension. We further show that while recently proposed domain-adapted models may lack adequate knowledge, directly fine-tuning on our collected medical knowledge datasets shows encouraging results, even generalising to unseen specialist sub-domains. We complement the quantitative results with a skill-oriented manual error analysis, which reveals a significant gap between the models' capabilities to simply recall necessary knowledge and to integrate it with the presented context. To foster research and collaboration in this field we share M-QALM—our resources, standardised methodology, and evaluation results—with the research community to facilitate further advancements in clinical knowledge representation learning within language models.",
    "M-RAG: Reinforcing Large Language Model Performance through Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Multiple Partitions": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant memories from an external database. However, existing RAG methods typically organize all memories in a whole database, potentially limiting focus on crucial memories and introducing noise. In this paper, we introduce a multiple partition paradigm for RAG (called M-RAG), where each database partition serves as a basic unit for RAG execution. Based on this paradigm, we propose a novel framework that leverages LLMs with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning to optimize different language generation tasks explicitly. Through comprehensive experiments conducted on seven datasets, spanning three language generation tasks and involving three distinct language model architectures, we confirm that M-RAG consistently outperforms various baseline methods, achieving improvements of 11%, 8%, and 12% for text summarization, machine translation, and dialogue generation, respectively.",
    "M3CoT: A Novel Benchmark for Multi-Domain Multi-step Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought": "Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) requires models to leverage knowledge from both textual and visual modalities for step-by-step reasoning, which gains increasing attention. Nevertheless, the current MCoT benchmark still faces some challenges: (1) absence of visual modal reasoning, (2) single-step visual modal reasoning, and (3) Domain missing, thereby hindering the development of MCoT. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel benchmark (M3CoT) to address the above challenges, advancing the multi-domain, multi-step, and multi-modal CoT. Additionally, we conduct a thorough evaluation involving abundant MCoT approaches on Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). In addition, we highlight that the current VLLMs still struggle to correctly reason in M3CoT and there remains a large gap between existing VLLMs and human performance in M3CoT, despite their superior results on previous MCoT benchmarks. To our knowledge, we take the first meaningful step toward the multi-domain, multi-step, and multi-modal scenario in MCoT. We hope that M3CoT can serve as a valuable resource, providing a pioneering foundation in multi-domain, multi-step, multi-modal chain-of-thought research.",
    "M4LE: A Multi-Ability Multi-Range Multi-Task Multi-Domain Long-Context Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models": "Managing long sequences has become an important and necessary feature for large language models (LLMs). However, assessing their ability to handle long contexts remains a challenge. This paper introduces M4LE, a Multi-ability, Multi-range, Multi-task, Multi-domain benchmark for Long-context Evaluation. It encompasses 36 NLP datasets, covering 11 types of tasks and 12 domains, providing a comprehensive test bed. To address the lack of tasks featuring naturally long sequences, we propose an automatic approach to convert short-sequence tasks into long-sequence scenarios. These scenarios evaluate LLMs' long-context understanding across five key abilities: understanding of single or multiple relevant spans in long contexts based on explicit or semantic hints, and global context understanding. This automatic approach allows us to create instances evenly distributed from 1k to 8k input length. Our evaluation of 11 prominent LLMs reveals that 1) Current LLMs struggle to understand long context, particularly when tasks require multiple-span attention. 2) Semantic retrieval is more difficult for competent LLMs. 3) Models fine-tuned on longer text with position interpolation have comparable performance to those using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) aware scaling methods without fine-tuning. We make our benchmark publicly available to encourage future research in this challenging area.",
    "Machine Unlearning of Pre-trained Large Language Models": "This study investigates the concept of the 'right to be forgotten' within the context of large language models (LLMs). We explore machine unlearning as a pivotal solution, with a focus on pre-trained models-a notably under-researched area. Our research delineates a comprehensive framework for machine unlearning in pre-trained LLMs, encompassing a critical analysis of seven diverse unlearning methods. Through rigorous evaluation using curated datasets from arXiv, books, and GitHub, we establish a robust benchmark for unlearning performance, demonstrating that these methods are over 105 times more computationally efficient than retraining. Our results show that integrating gradient ascent with gradient descent on in-distribution data improves hyperparameter robustness. We also provide detailed guidelines for efficient hyperparameter tuning in the unlearning process. Our findings advance the discourse on ethical AI practices, offering substantive insights into the mechanics of machine unlearning for pre-trained LLMs and underscoring the potential for responsible AI development.",
    "MAGE: Machine-generated Text Detection in the Wild": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved human-level text generation, emphasizing the need for effective AI-generated text detection to mitigate risks like the spread of fake news and plagiarism. Existing research has been constrained by evaluating detection methods on specific domains or particular language models. In practical scenarios, however, the detector faces texts from various domains or LLMs without knowing their sources. To this end, we build a comprehensive testbed by gathering texts from diverse human writings and texts generated by different LLMs. Empirical results show challenges in distinguishing machine-generated texts from human-authored ones across various scenarios, especially out-of-distribution. These challenges are due to the decreasing linguistic distinctions between the two sources. Despite challenges, the top-performing detector can identify 86.54% out-of-domain texts generated by a new LLM, indicating the feasibility for application scenarios.",
    "MAIRA at RRG24: A specialised large multimodal model for radiology report generation": "This paper discusses the participation of the MSR MAIRA team in the Large-Scale Radiology Report Generation Shared Task Challenge, as part of the BioNLP workshop at ACL 2024. We present a radiology-specific multimodal model designed to generate radiological reports from chest X-Rays (CXRs). Our proposed model combines a CXR-specific image encoder RAD-DINO (Pérez-García et al., 2024) with a Large Language Model (LLM) based on Vicuna-7B, via a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) adapter. Both the adapter and the LLM have been fine-tuned in a single-stage training setup to generate radiology reports. Experimental results indicate that a joint training setup with findings and impression sections improves findings prediction. Additionally, incorporating lateral images alongside frontal images when available further enhances all metrics. More information and resources about MAIRA can be found on the project website: http://aka.ms/maira.",
    "Make-A-Voice: Revisiting Voice Large Language Models as Scalable Multilingual and Multitask Learners": "Large language models (LLMs) have successfully served as a general-purpose interface across multiple tasks and languages, while the adaptation of voice LLMs is mostly designed for specific purposes (either single-task or monolingual), where the advantages of LLMs especially for low-resource language processing and zero-shot task generalization are less exploited in the audio community. To bridge the gap, we introduce Make-A-Voice as a multimodal voice LLM and conduct a comprehensive study on its capability to deal with multiple tasks/languages. When trained on ∼200K hours of 6-language data for 4 voice generation applications, Make-A-Voice emerges notable advantages: 1) as scalable learners to improve performance with end-to-end local and global multiscale transformers; and 2) as multitask learners by adjusting prompts to share common knowledge across modalities (speech/singing) and present in-context learning abilities by generalizing to unseen tasks not explicitly train on; 3) as multilingual learners to alleviate data scarcity of low-resource languages by including rich-resource language training data. Experimental results demonstrate that Make-A-Voice exhibits superior audio quality and style similarity compared with competitive baseline models in monolingual/cross-lingual voice generation.",
    "Making Harmful Behaviors Unlearnable for Large Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential to empower various domains and are often customized by fine-tuning for the requirements of different applications. However, the powerful learning ability of LLMs not only enables them to learn new tasks but also makes them vulnerable to learning undesired behaviors, such as harmfulness and hallucination, as the fine-tuning data often implicitly or explicitly contains such content. Can we fine-tune LLMs on harmful data without learning harmful behaviors? This paper proposes a controllable training framework to make undesired behaviors unlearnable during the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we introduce security vectors to control the model's behavior and make it consistent with the undesired behavior. Security vectors are activated during fine-tuning, the consistent behavior makes the model believe that such behavior has already been learned and there is no need for further optimization, while inconsistent data can still be learned. After fine-tuning, security vectors are deactivated to restore the LLM's normal behavior. Our experiments show that the security vectors can prevent LLM from learning harmful and hallucination behavior while preserving the ability to learn other information. Warning: This paper may contain offensive content.",
    "Making Long-Context Language Models Better Multi-Hop Reasoners": "Recent advancements in long-context modeling have enhanced language models (LMs) for complex tasks across multiple NLP applications. Despite this progress, we find that these models struggle with multi-hop reasoning and exhibit decreased performance in the presence of noisy contexts. In this paper, we introduce Reasoning with Attributions, a novel approach that prompts LMs to supply attributions for each assertion during their reasoning. We validate our approach through experiments on three multi-hop datasets, employing both proprietary and open-source models, and demonstrate its efficacy and resilience. Furthermore, we explore methods to augment reasoning capabilities via fine-tuning and offer an attribution-annotated dataset and a specialized training strategy. Our fine-tuned model achieves competitive performance on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, closely paralleling proprietary LMs such as ChatGPT and Claude-instant1.",
    "MapCoder: Multi-Agent Code Generation for Competitive Problem Solving": "Code synthesis, which requires a deep understanding of complex natural language (NL) problem descriptions, generation of code instructions for complex algorithms and data structures, and the successful execution of comprehensive unit tests, presents a significant challenge. Thus, while large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive proficiency in natural language processing (NLP), their performance in code generation tasks remains limited. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to code generation tasks leveraging the multi-agent prompting that uniquely replicates the full cycle of program synthesis as observed in human developers. Our framework, MapCoder, consists of four LLM agents specifically designed to emulate the stages of this cycle: recalling relevant examples, planning, code generation, and debugging. After conducting thorough experiments, with multiple LLMs ablations and analyses across eight challenging competitive problem-solving and program synthesis benchmarks—MapCoder showcases remarkable code generation capabilities, achieving their new state-of-the-art (pass@1) results—(HumanEval 93.9%, MBPP 83.1%, APPS 22.0%, CodeContests 28.5%, and xCodeEval 45.3%). Moreover, our method consistently delivers superior performance across various programming languages and varying problem difficulties. We open-source our framework at https://github.com/Md-Ashraful-Pramanik/MapCoder.",
    "MapGPT: Map-Guided Prompting with Adaptive Path Planning for Vision-and-Language Navigation": "Embodied agents equipped with GPT as their brains have exhibited extraordinary decision-making and generalization abilities across various tasks. However, existing zero-shot agents for vision-and-language navigation (VLN) only prompt GPT-4 to select potential locations within localized environments, without constructing an effective “global-view” for the agent to understand the overall environment. In this work, we present a novel map-guided GPT-based agent, dubbed MapGPT, which introduces an online linguistic-formed map to encourage global exploration. Specifically, we build an online map and incorporate it into the prompts that include node information and topological relationships, to help GPT understand the spatial environment. Benefiting from this design, we further propose an adaptive planning mechanism to assist the agent in performing multi-step path planning based on a map, systematically exploring multiple candidate nodes or sub-goals step by step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MapGPT is applicable to both GPT-4 and GPT-4V, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on R2R and REVERIE simultaneously (∼10% and ∼12% improvements in SR), and showcasing the newly emergent global thinking and path planning abilities of the GPT.",
    "MAPLE: Multilingual Evaluation of Parameter Efficient Finetuning of Large Language Models": "Parameter Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) has emerged as a viable solution for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without requiring massive resources and compute. Prior work on multilingual evaluation has shown that there is a large gap between the performance of LLMs on English and other languages. Further, there is also a large gap between the performance of smaller open-source models and larger LLMs. Finetuning can be an effective way to bridge this gap and make language models more equitable. In this work, we finetune the LLAMA-2-7B and MISTRAL-7B models on two synthetic multilingual instruction tuning datasets to determine its effect on model performance on six downstream tasks covering forty languages in all. Additionally, we experiment with various parameters, such as rank for low-rank adaptation and values of quantisation to determine their effects on downstream performance and find that higher rank and higher quantisation values benefit low-resource languages. We find that PEFT of smaller open-source models sometimes bridges the gap between the performance of these models and the larger ones, however, English performance can take a hit. We also find that finetuning sometimes improves performance on low-resource languages, while degrading performance on high-resource languages.",
    "MAPO: Advancing Multilingual Reasoning through Multilingual-Alignment-as-Preference Optimization": "Intuitively, reasoning abilities are considered language-agnostic. However, existing LLMs exhibit inconsistent reasoning abilities across different languages, e.g., reasoning in the dominant language like English is superior to other languages due to the imbalance of multilingual training data. To enhance reasoning abilities in non-dominant languages, we propose a Multilingual-Alignment-as-Preference Optimization framework (MAPO) to align the reasoning processes in other languages with the dominant language. Specifically, we harness an off-the-shelf translation model for the consistency between answers in non-dominant and dominant languages, which we adopt as the preference for optimization, e.g., Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Experiments show that MAPO stably achieves significant improvements in the multilingual reasoning of various models on all three benchmarks (MSVAMP +16.2%, MGSM +6.1%, and MNumGLUESub +13.3%), with improved reasoning consistency across languages.",
    "MAP's not dead yet: Uncovering true language model modes by conditioning away degeneracy": "It has been widely observed that exact or approximate MAP (mode-seeking) decoding from natural language generation (NLG) models consistently leads to degenerate outputs (Holtzman et al., 2019; Stahlberg and Byrne, 2019). Prior work has attributed this behavior to either a fundamental and unavoidable inadequacy of modes in probabilistic models or weaknesses in language modeling. Contrarily, we argue that degenerate modes can even occur in the absence of any modeling error, due to contamination of the training data. Specifically, we argue that mixing even a tiny amount of low-entropy noise with a population text distribution can cause the data distribution's mode to become degenerate. We therefore propose to apply MAP decoding to the model's true conditional distribution where the conditioning variable explicitly avoids specific degenerate behavior. Using exact search, we empirically verify that the length-conditional modes of machine translation models and language models are indeed more fluent and topical than their unconditional modes. For the first time, we also share many examples of exact modal sequences from these models, and from several variants of the LLaMA-7B model. Notably, we observe that various kinds of degenerate modes persist, even at the scale of LLaMA-7B. Although we cannot tractably address these degeneracies with exact search, we perform a classifier-based approximate search on LLaMA-7B, a model which was not trained for instruction following, and find that we are able to elicit reasonable outputs without any finetuning.",
    "Marathon: A Race Through the Realm of Long Context with Large Language Models": "With the advancement of large language models (LLMs) and the expansion of their context windows, existing long-context benchmarks fall short in effectively evaluating the models' comprehension and reasoning abilities in extended texts. Moreover, conventional benchmarks relying on F1 metrics often inaccurately score responses: they may undervalue correct answers that differ from the reference responses and overvalue incorrect ones that resemble the reference texts. In response to these limitations, we introduce Marathon, a novel evaluation benchmark that adopts a multiple-choice question format. It is specifically designed to overcome the constraints of previous benchmarks and provide a rapid, precise, and unbiased appraisal of the long-context comprehension skills of large language models. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on the Marathon benchmark with a range of state-of-the-art LLMs and assessed the effectiveness of various optimization strategies tailored for long-context generation. We anticipate that the Marathon benchmark and its associated leaderboard will enable a more precise and equitable evaluation of LLMs' capabilities in understanding and reasoning over extended contexts.",
    "MARIO: MAth Reasoning with code Interpreter Output - A Reproducible Pipeline": "Large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved in understanding natural language but still lack in mathematical reasoning, a hurdle on the path to true artificial general intelligence. The training of large language models, based on next-token prediction, struggles to capture the precise nature of mathematical reasoning, presenting both practical and theoretical challenges. In this paper, we address this challenge by enriching the data landscape and introducing a reasonable data format, enhanced the text analysis of the LLM with a capability to utilize a Python code interpreter. This dataset is derived from GSM8K and MATH and has been further refined through a combination of GPT annotations, human review, and self-training processes. Additionally, we propose a tentative, easily replicable protocol for the fine-tuning of math-specific LLMs, which has led to a significant improvement in the performance of a 7B-parameter LLM on the GSM8K and MATH datasets. A solution generator and a value estimator are fine-tuned simultaneously in a multi-task fashion, while an outlier-free value model-based inference method is proposed to further boost the performance. We are committed to advancing the field of mathematical reasoning in LLMs. and, to that end, we will make the source code and checkpoints publicly available.",
    "MARS: Meaning-Aware Response Scoring for Uncertainty Estimation in Generative LLMs": "Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely utilized for their excellence in various tasks. However, their tendency to produce inaccurate or misleading outputs poses a potential risk, particularly in high-stakes environments. Therefore, estimating the correctness of generative LLM outputs is an important task for enhanced reliability. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) in generative LLMs is an evolving domain, where SOTA probability-based methods commonly employ length-normalized scoring. In this work, we propose Meaning-Aware Response Scoring (MARS) as an alternative to length-normalized scoring for UE methods. MARS is a novel scoring function that considers the semantic contribution of each token in the generated sequence in the context of the question. We demonstrate that integrating MARS into UE methods results in a universal and significant improvement in UE performance. We conduct experiments using three distinct closed-book question-answering datasets across five popular pre-trained LLMs. Lastly, we validate the efficacy of MARS on a Medical QA dataset.",
    "Masked Thought: Simply Masking Partial Reasoning Steps Can Improve Mathematical Reasoning Learning of Language Models": "In reasoning tasks, even a minor error can cascade into inaccurate results, leading to suboptimal performance of large language models in such domains. Earlier fine-tuning approaches sought to mitigate this by leveraging more precise supervisory signals from human labeling, larger models, or self-sampling, although at a high cost. Conversely, we develop a method that avoids external resources, relying instead on introducing perturbations to the input. Our training approach randomly masks certain tokens within the chain of thought, a technique we found to be particularly effective for reasoning tasks. When applied to fine-tuning with GSM8K on Llama-2-7B, this method achieved a 5% improvement in GSM8K accuracy and a 10% improvement in GSM-IC accuracy over standard supervised fine-tuning with a few codes modified. Furthermore, it is complementary to existing methods. When integrated with related explicit data augmentation methods, it leads to improvements across five datasets of various augmentation methods, as well as two different base models. We further investigate the mechanisms behind this improvement through case studies and quantitative analysis, suggesting that our approach may provide superior support for the model in capturing long-distance dependencies, especially those related to questions. This enhancement could deepen understanding of the premises in questions and prior steps. Our code is available at Github.",

This study expands on this work by examining the effectiveness of existing knowledge editing methods across languages and delving into the role of attention mechanisms in this process. Drawing from the insights gained, we propose Mass-Editing Memory with Attention in Transformers (MEMAT), a method that achieves significant improvements in all metrics while requiring minimal parameter modifications. MEMAT delivers a remarkable 10% increase in magnitude metrics, benefits languages not included in the training data and also demonstrates a high degree of portability. Our code and data are at https://github.com/dtamayo-nlp/MEMAT.",
    "Math-Shepherd: Verify and Reinforce LLMs Step-by-step without Human Annotations": "In this paper, we present an innovative process-oriented math process reward model called MATH-SHEPHERD, which assigns a reward score to each step of math problem solutions. The training of MATH-SHEPHERD is achieved using automatically constructed process-wise supervision data, breaking the bottleneck of heavy reliance on manual annotation in existing work. We explore the effectiveness of MATH-SHEPHERD in two scenarios: 1) Verification: MATH-SHEPHERD is utilized for reranking multiple outputs generated by Large Language Models (LLMs); 2) Reinforcement Learning (RL): MATH-SHEPHERD is employed to reinforce LLMs. With MATH-SHEPHERD, a series of open-source LLMs demonstrates exceptional performance. For instance, process RL with MATH-SHEPHERD significantly enhances Mistral-7B (77.9%→84.1% on GSM8K and 28.6%→33.0% on MATH). The accuracy can be further improved to 89.1% and 43.5% on two benchmarks with verification of MATH-SHEPHERD. We believe that automatic process supervision holds significant potential for the future evolution of LLMs.",

However, traditional math benchmarks like GSM8k offer a unidimensional perspective, falling short in providing a holistic assessment of the LLMs' math capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce MathBench, a new benchmark that rigorously assesses the mathematical capabilities of large language models. MathBench spans a wide range of mathematical disciplines, offering a detailed evaluation of both theoretical understanding and practical problem-solving skills. The benchmark progresses through five distinct stages, from basic arithmetic to college mathematics, and is structured to evaluate models at various depths of knowledge. Each stage includes theoretical questions and application problems, allowing us to measure a model's mathematical proficiency and its ability to apply concepts in practical scenarios.

However, there remains a performance gap in this area between existing open-source models and closed-source models such as GPT-4. In this paper, we introduce MathGenie, a novel method for generating diverse and reliable math problems from a small-scale problem-solution dataset (denoted as seed data). We augment the ground-truth solutions of our seed data and train a back-translation model to translate the augmented solutions back into new questions. Subsequently, we generate code-integrated solutions for the new questions. To ensure the correctness of the code-integrated solutions, we employ rationale-based strategy for solution verification. Various pretrained models, ranging from 7B to 70B, are trained on the newly curated data to test the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation technique, resulting in a family of models known as MathGenieLM. These models consistently outperform previous open-source models across five representative mathematical reasoning datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. In particular, MathGenieLM-InternLM2 achieves an accuracy of 87.7% on GSM8K and 55.7% on MATH, securing the best overall score among open-source language models.",
    "MatPlotAgent: Method and Evaluation for LLM-Based Agentic Scientific Data Visualization": "Scientific data visualization plays a crucial role in research by enabling the direct display of complex information and assisting researchers in identifying implicit patterns. Despite its importance, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for scientific data visualization remains rather unexplored. In this study, we introduce MatPlotAgent, an efficient model-agnostic LLM agent framework designed to automate scientific data visualization tasks. Leveraging the capabilities of both code LLMs and multi-modal LLMs, MatPlotAgent consists of three core modules: query understanding, code generation with iterative debugging, and a visual feedback mechanism for error correction. To address the lack of benchmarks in this field, we present MatPlotBench, a high-quality benchmark consisting of 100 human-verified test cases. Additionally, we introduce a scoring approach that utilizes GPT-4V for automatic evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that MatPlotAgent can improve the performance of various LLMs, including both commercial and open-source models. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation method shows a strong correlation with human-annotated scores.",
    "MAVEN-ARG: Completing the Puzzle of All-in-One Event Understanding Dataset with Event Argument Annotation": "Understanding events in texts is a core objective of natural language understanding, which requires detecting event occurrences, extracting event arguments, and analyzing inter-event relationships. However, due to the annotation challenges brought by task complexity, a large-scale dataset covering the full process of event understanding has long been absent. In this paper, we introduce MAVEN-ARG, which augments MAVEN datasets with event argument annotations, making the first all-in-one dataset supporting event detection, event argument extraction (EAE), and event relation extraction. As an EAE benchmark, MAVEN-ARG offers three main advantages: (1) a comprehensive schema covering 162 event types and 612 argument roles, all with expert-written definitions and examples; (2) a large data scale, containing 98,591 events and 290,613 arguments obtained with laborious human annotation; (3) the exhaustive annotation supporting all task variants of EAE, which annotates both entity and non-entity event arguments in document level. Experiments indicate that MAVEN-ARG is quite challenging for both fine-tuned EAE models and proprietary large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate the benefits of an all-in-one dataset, we preliminarily explore a potential application, future event prediction, with LLMs.",
    "MBENCH: Benchmarking Theory of Mind in Large Language Models": "Theory of Mind (ToM) is the cognitive capability to perceive and ascribe mental states to oneself and others. Recent research has sparked a debate over whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit a form of ToM. However, existing ToM evaluations are hindered by challenges such as constrained scope, subjective judgment, and unintended contamination, yielding inadequate assessments. To address this gap, we introduce TMBENCH with three key characteristics: a systematic evaluation framework encompassing 8 tasks and 31 abilities in social cognition, a multiple-choice question format to support automated and unbiased evaluation, and a build-from-scratch bilingual inventory to strictly avoid data leakage. Based on TMBENCH, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the ToM performance of 10 popular LLMs across tasks and abilities. We find that even the most advanced LLMs like GPT-4 lag behind human performance by over 10% points, indicating that LLMs have not achieved a human-level theory of mind yet. Our aim with TMBENCH is to enable an efficient and effective evaluation of LLMs' ToM capabilities, thereby facilitating the development of LLMs with inherent social intelligence.",
    "MBIAS: Mitigating Bias in Large Language Models While Retaining Context": "The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in diverse applications necessitates an assurance of safety without compromising the contextual integrity of the generated content. Traditional approaches, including safety-specific fine-tuning or adversarial testing, often yield safe outputs at the expense of contextual meaning. This can result in a diminished capacity to handle nuanced aspects of bias and toxicity, such as underrepresentation or negative portrayals across various demographics. To address these challenges, we introduce MBIAS, an LLM framework carefully instruction fine-tuned on a custom dataset designed specifically for safety interventions. MBIAS is designed to significantly reduce biases and toxic elements in LLM outputs while preserving the main information. This work also details our further use of LLMs: as annotator under human supervision and as evaluator of generated content. Empirical analysis reveals that MBIAS achieves a reduction in bias and toxicity by over 30% in standard evaluations, and by more than 90% in diverse demographic tests, highlighting the robustness of our approach. We make the dataset and the fine-tuned MBIAS model available to the research community for further investigation and to ensure reproducibility.",

With the abundance of readily available high-quality English image-text data as well as strong monolingual English LLMs, the research focus has been on English-only Vision-LLMs. Multilingual vision-language models are still predominantly obtained via expensive end-to-end pretraining, resulting in comparatively smaller models, trained on limited multilingual image data supplemented with text-only multilingual corpora.  We present mBLIP, the first Vision-LLM leveraging multilingual LLMs, which we obtain in a computationally efficient manner on consumer-level hardware. To this end, we re-align an image encoder previously tuned to an English LLM to a new, multilingual LLM using only a few million multilingual training examples derived from a mix of vision-and-language tasks, which we obtain by machine-translating high-quality English data to 95 languages. On the IGLUE benchmark and XM3600, mBLIP yields results competitive with state-of-the-art models and it greatly outperforms strong English-only Vision-LLMs like Llava 1.5.

As most research mainly focuses on English, with few explorations in a multilingual context, the question of how reliable this reasoning capability is in different languages is still open. To address it directly, we study multilingual reasoning consistency across multiple languages, using popular open-source LLMs. First, we compile the first large-scale multilingual math reasoning dataset, mCoT-MATH, covering eleven diverse languages. Then, we introduce multilingual CoT instruction tuning to boost reasoning capability across languages, thereby improving model consistency. While existing LLMs show substantial variation across the languages we consider, and especially low performance for lesser resourced languages, our 7B parameter model mCoT achieves impressive consistency across languages, and superior or comparable performance to close- and open-source models even of much larger sizes.",
    "mCSQA: Multilingual Commonsense Reasoning Dataset with Unified Creation Strategy by Language Models and Humans": "It is very challenging to curate a dataset for language-specific knowledge and common sense in order to evaluate natural language understanding capabilities of language models. Due to the limitation in the availability of annotators, most current multilingual datasets are created through translation, which cannot evaluate such language-specific aspects. Therefore, we propose Multilingual CommonsenseQA (mCSQA) based on the construction process of CSQA but leveraging language models for a more efficient construction, e.g., by asking LM to generate questions/answers, refine answers and verify QAs followed by reduced human efforts for verification. Constructed dataset is a benchmark for cross-lingual language-transfer capabilities of multilingual LMs, and experimental results showed high language-transfer capabilities for questions that LMs could easily solve, but lower transfer capabilities for questions requiring deep knowledge or commonsense. This highlights the necessity of language-specific datasets for evaluation and training. Finally, our method demonstrated that multilingual LMs could create QA including language-specific knowledge, significantly reducing the dataset creation cost compared to manual creation. The datasets are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/yusuke1997/mCSQA.",
    "Measuring Bargaining Abilities of LLMs: A Benchmark and A Buyer-Enhancement Method": "Bargaining is an important and unique part of negotiation between humans. As LLM-driven agents learn to negotiate and act like real humans, how to evaluate agents' bargaining abilities remains an open problem. For the first time, we formally described the Bargaining task as an asymmetric incomplete information game, defining the gains of the Buyer and Seller in multiple bargaining processes. It allows us to quantitatively assess an agent's performance in the Bargain task. We collected a real product price dataset, AmazonHistoryPrice, and conducted evaluations of various LLM agents' bargaining abilities. We find that playing a Buyer is much harder than a Seller, and increasing model size can not effectively improve the Buyer's performance. To address the challenge, we propose a novel approach called OG-Narrator that integrates a deterministic Offer Generator to control the price range of Buyer's offers, and an LLM Narrator to create natural language sentences for generated offers. Experimental results show that OG-Narrator improves the buyer's deal rates from 26.67% to 88.88% and brings a ten times multiplication of profits on all baselines, even a model that has not been aligned.",
    "Measuring Cultural Bias in Large Language Models": "As the reach of large language models (LMs) expands globally, their ability to cater to diverse cultural contexts becomes crucial. Despite advancements in multilingual capabilities, models are not designed with appropriate cultural nuances. In this paper, we show that multilingual and Arabic monolingual LMs exhibit bias towards entities associated with Western culture. We introduce CAMeL, a novel resource of 628 naturally-occurring prompts and 20,368 entities spanning eight types that contrast Arab and Western cultures. CAMeL provides a foundation for measuring cultural biases in LMs through both extrinsic and intrinsic evaluations. Using CAMeL, we examine the cross-cultural performance in Arabic of 16 different LMs on tasks such as story generation, NER, and sentiment analysis, where we find concerning cases of stereotyping and cultural unfairness. We further test their text-infilling performance, revealing the incapability of appropriate adaptation to Arab cultural contexts. Finally, we analyze 6 Arabic pre-training corpora and find that commonly used sources such as Wikipedia may not be best suited to build culturally aware LMs, if used as they are without adjustment.",
    "Measuring Political Bias in Large Language Models: What Is Said and How It Is Said": "We propose to measure political bias in LLMs by analyzing both the content and style of their generated content regarding political issues. Existing benchmarks and measures focus on gender and racial biases. However, political bias exists in LLMs and can lead to polarization and other harms in downstream applications. In order to provide transparency to users, we advocate that there should be fine-grained and explainable measures of political biases generated by LLMs. Our proposed measure looks at different political issues such as reproductive rights and climate change, at both the content (the substance of the generation) and the style (the lexical polarity) of such bias. We measured the political bias in eleven open-sourced LLMs and showed that our proposed framework is easily scalable to other topics and is explainable.",
    "Measuring Social Bias in Large Language Models": "Warning: This paper contains examples of bias that can be offensive or upsetting. Social bias is shaped by the accumulation of social perceptions towards targets across various demographic identities. To fully understand such social bias in large language models (LLMs), it is essential to consider the composite of social perceptions from diverse perspectives among identities. Previous studies have either evaluated biases in LLMs by indirectly assessing the presence of sentiments towards demographic identities in the generated text or measuring the degree of alignment with given stereotypes. These methods have limitations in directly quantifying social biases at the level of distinct perspectives among identities. In this paper, we aim to investigate how social perceptions from various viewpoints contribute to the development of social bias in LLMs. To this end, we propose a novel strategy to intuitively quantify these social perceptions and suggest metrics that can evaluate the social biases within LLMs by aggregating diverse social perceptions. The experimental results show the quantitative demonstration of the social attitude in LLMs by examining social perception. The analysis we conducted shows that our proposed metrics capture the multi-dimensional aspects of social bias, enabling a fine-grained and comprehensive investigation of bias in LLMs.",
    "Measuring the Inconsistency of Large Language Models in Ordinal Preference Formation": "Despite large language models' (LLMs) recent advancements, their bias and hallucination issues persist, and their ability to offer consistent and preferential rankings remains under-explored. This study investigates the capacity of LLMs to provide consistent ordinal preferences, a crucial aspect in scenarios with dense decision space or lacking absolute answers. We introduce a formalization of consistency based on order theory, outlining criteria such as transitivity, asymmetry, reversibility, and independence from irrelevant alternatives. Our diagnostic experiments on selected state-of-the-art LLMs reveal their inability to meet these criteria, indicating a strong positional bias and poor transitivity, with preferences easily swayed by irrelevant alternatives. These findings highlight a significant inconsistency in LLM-generated preferential rankings, underscoring the need for further research to address these limitations.",
    "MEDAGENTS: Large Language Models as Collaborators for Zero-shot Medical Reasoning": "Large language models (LLMs), despite their remarkable progress across various general domains, encounter significant barriers in medicine and healthcare. This field faces unique challenges such as domain-specific terminologies and reasoning over specialized knowledge. To address these issues, we propose MEDAGENTS, a novel multi-disciplinary collaboration framework for the medical domain. MedAgents leverages LLM-based agents in a role-playing setting that participate in a collaborative multi-round discussion, thereby enhancing LLM proficiency and reasoning capabilities. This training-free framework encompasses five critical steps: gathering domain experts, proposing individual analyses, summarising these analyses into a report, iterating over discussions until a consensus is reached, and ultimately making a decision. Our work focuses on the zero-shot setting, which is applicable in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on nine datasets (MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and six subtasks from MMLU) establish that our proposed MEDAGENTS framework excels at mining and harnessing the medical expertise within LLMs, as well as extending its reasoning abilities. Our code can be found at https://github.com/gersteinlab/MedAgents.",
    "MedExQA: Medical Question Answering Benchmark with Multiple Explanations": "This paper introduces MedExQA, a novel benchmark in medical question-answering, to evaluate large language models' (LLMs) understanding of medical knowledge through explanations. By constructing datasets across five distinct medical specialties that are underrepresented in current datasets and further incorporating multiple explanations for each question-answer pair, we address a major gap in current medical QA benchmarks which is the absence of comprehensive assessments of LLMs' ability to generate nuanced medical explanations. Our work highlights the importance of explainability in medical LLMs, proposes an effective methodology for evaluating models beyond classification accuracy, and sheds light on one specific domain, speech language pathology, where current LLMs including GPT4 lack good understanding. Our results show generation evaluation with multiple explanations aligns better with human assessment, highlighting an opportunity for a more robust automated comprehension assessment for LLMs. To diversify open-source medical LLMs (currently mostly based on Llama2), this work also proposes a new medical model, MedPhi-2, based on Phi-2 (2.7B). The model outperformed medical LLMs based on Llama2-70B in generating explanations, showing its effectiveness in the resource-constrained medical domain. The benchmark datasets and the model can be found at https://github.com/knowlab/MedExQA.",
    "Medical Dialogue System: A Survey of Categories, Methods, Evaluation and Challenges": "This paper surveys and organizes research works on medical dialog systems, which is an important yet challenging task. Although these systems have been surveyed in the medical community from an application perspective, a systematic review from a rigorous technical perspective has to date remained noticeably absent. As a result, an overview of the categories, methods, and evaluation of medical dialogue systems remain limited and underspecified, hindering the further improvement of this area. To fill this gap, we investigate an initial pool of 327 papers from well-known computer science, and natural language processing conferences and journals, and make an overview. Recently, large language models have shown strong model capacity on downstream tasks, which also reshaped medical dialog systems' foundation. Despite the alluring practical application value, current medical dialogue systems still suffer from problems. To this end, this paper lists the grand challenges of medical dialog systems, especially of large language models.",
    "MediSwift: Efficient Sparse Pre-trained Biomedical Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on general source data for various domains, but a recent surge in domain-specific LLMs has shown their potential to outperform general-purpose models in domain-specific tasks (e.g., biomedicine). Although domain-specific pre-training enhances efficiency and leads to smaller models, the computational costs of training these LLMs remain high, posing budgeting challenges. We introduce MediSwift, a suite of biomedical LMs that leverage sparse pre-training on domain-specific biomedical text data. By inducing up to 75% weight sparsity during the pre-training phase, MediSwift achieves a 2-2.5x reduction in training FLOPs. Notably, all sparse pre-training was performed on the Cerebras CS-2 system, which is specifically designed to realize the acceleration benefits from unstructured weight sparsity, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency of the MediSwift models. Through subsequent dense fine-tuning and strategic soft prompting, MediSwift models outperform existing LLMs up to 7B parameters on biomedical tasks, setting new benchmarks w.r.t efficiency-accuracy on tasks such as PubMedQA. Our results show that sparse pre-training, along with dense fine-tuning and soft prompting, offers an effective method for creating high-performing, computationally efficient models in specialized domains.",
    "MedREQAL: Examining Medical Knowledge Recall of Large Language Models via Question Answering": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive ability to encode knowledge during pre-training on large text corpora. They can leverage this knowledge for downstream tasks like question answering (QA), even in complex areas involving health topics. Considering their high potential for facilitating clinical work in the future, understanding the quality of encoded medical knowledge and its recall in LLMs is an important step forward. In this study, we examine the capability of LLMs to exhibit medical knowledge recall by constructing a novel dataset derived from systematic reviews - studies synthesizing evidence-based answers for specific medical questions. Through experiments on the new MedREQAL dataset, comprising question-answer pairs extracted from rigorous systematic reviews, we assess six LLMs, such as GPT and Mixtral, analyzing their classification and generation performance. Our experimental insights into LLM performance on the novel biomedical QA dataset reveal the still challenging nature of this task.",
    "MEEL: Multi-Modal Event Evolution Learning": "Multi-modal Event Reasoning (MMER) endeavors to endow machines with the ability to comprehend intricate event relations across diverse data modalities. MMER is fundamental and underlies a wide broad of applications. Despite extensive instruction fine-tuning, current multi-modal large language models still fall short in such ability. The disparity stems from that existing models are insufficient to capture underlying principles governing event evolution in various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Modal Event Evolution Learning (MEEL) to enable the model to grasp the event evolution mechanism yielding advanced MMER ability. Specifically, we commence with the design of event diversification to gather seed events from a rich spectrum of scenarios. Subsequently, we employ ChatGPT to generate evolving graphs for these seed events. We propose an instruction encapsulation process that formulates the evolving graphs into instruction-tuning data, aligning the comprehension of event reasoning to humans. Finally, we observe that models trained in this way are still struggling to fully comprehend event evolution. In such a case, we propose the guiding discrimination strategy, in which models are trained to discriminate the improper evolution direction. We collect and curate a benchmark M-EV2 for MMER. Extensive experiments on M-EV2 validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing competitive performance in open-source multi-modal LLMs. Code and Dataset are available on https://github.com/TZWwww/MEEL.",
    "MEFT: Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning through Sparse Adapter": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) facilitates the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) under limited resources. However, the fine-tuning performance with PEFT on complex, knowledge-intensive tasks is limited due to the constrained model capacity, which originates from the limited number of additional trainable parameters. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel mechanism that fine-tunes LLMs with adapters of larger size yet memory-efficient. This is achieved by leveraging the inherent activation sparsity in the Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) of LLMs and utilizing the larger capacity of Central Processing Unit (CPU) memory compared to Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). We store and update the parameters of larger adapters on the CPU. Moreover, we employ a Mixture of Experts (MoE)-like architecture to mitigate unnecessary CPU computations and reduce the communication volume between the GPU and CPU. This is particularly beneficial over the limited bandwidth of PCI Express (PCIe). Our method can achieve fine-tuning results comparable to those obtained with larger memory capacities, even when operating under more limited resources such as a 24GB memory single GPU setup, with acceptable loss in training efficiency.",
    "MELA: Multilingual Evaluation of Linguistic Acceptability": "In this work, we present the largest benchmark to date on linguistic acceptability: Multilingual Evaluation of Linguistic Acceptability—MELA, with 46K samples covering 10 languages from a diverse set of language families. We establish LLM baselines on this benchmark, and investigate cross-lingual transfer in acceptability judgements with XLM-R. In pursuit of multilingual interpretability, we conduct probing experiments with fine-tuned XLM-R to explore the process of syntax capability acquisition. Our results show that GPT-4o exhibits a strong multilingual ability, outperforming fine-tuned XLM-R, while open-source multilingual models lag behind by a noticeable gap. Cross-lingual transfer experiments show that transfer in acceptability judgment is non-trivial: 500 Icelandic fine-tuning examples lead to 23 MCC performance in a completely unrelated language—Chinese. Results of our probing experiments indicate that training on MELA improves the performance of XLM-R on syntax-related tasks.",
    "MELoRA: Mini-Ensemble Low-Rank Adapters for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a popular method for tailoring pre-trained large language models (LLMs), especially as the models' scale and the diversity of tasks increase. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is based on the idea that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional, i.e., significant model changes can be represented with relatively few parameters. However, decreasing the rank encounters challenges with generalization errors for specific tasks when compared to full-parameter fine-tuning. We present MELoRA, a mini-ensemble low-rank adapters that uses fewer trainable parameters while maintaining a higher rank, thereby offering improved performance potential. The core idea is to freeze original pretrained weights and train a group of mini LoRAs with only a small number of parameters. This can capture a significant degree of diversity among mini LoRAs, thus promoting better generalization ability. We conduct a theoretical analysis and empirical studies on various NLP tasks. Our experimental results show that, compared to LoRA, MELoRA achieves better performance with 8 times fewer trainable parameters on natural language understanding tasks and 36 times fewer trainable parameters on instruction following tasks, which demonstrates the effectiveness of MELoRA.",
    "MemeGuard: An LLM and VLM-based Framework for Advancing Content Moderation via Meme Intervention": "In the digital world, memes present a unique challenge for content moderation due to their potential to spread harmful content. Although detection methods have improved, proactive solutions such as intervention are still limited, with current research focusing mostly on text-based content, neglecting the widespread influence of multimodal content like memes. Addressing this gap, we present MemeGuard, a comprehensive framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) for meme intervention. MemeGuard harnesses a specially fine-tuned VLM, VLMeme, for meme interpretation, and a multimodal knowledge selection and ranking mechanism (MKS) for distilling relevant knowledge. This knowledge is then employed by a general-purpose LLM to generate contextually appropriate interventions. Another key contribution of this work is the Intervening Cyberbullying in Multimodal Memes (ICMM) dataset, a high-quality, labeled dataset featuring toxic memes and their corresponding human-annotated interventions. We leverage ICMM to test MemeGuard, demonstrating its proficiency in generating relevant and effective responses to toxic memes.",
    "MemeMind at ArAIEval Shared Task: Generative Augmentation and Feature Fusion for Multimodal Propaganda Detection in Arabic Memes through Advanced Language and Vision Models": "Detecting propaganda in multimodal content, such as memes, is crucial for combating disinformation on social media. This paper presents a novel approach for the ArAIEval 2024 shared Task 2 on Multimodal Propagandistic Memes Classification, involving text, image, and multimodal classification of Arabic memes. For text classification (Task 2A), we fine-tune state-of-the-art Arabic language models and use ChatGPT4-generated synthetic text for data augmentation. For image classification (Task 2B), we fine-tune ResNet18, EfficientFormerV2, and ConvNeXt-tiny architectures with DALL-E-2-generated synthetic images. For multimodal classification (Task 2C), we combine ConvNeXt-tiny and BERT architectures in a fusion layer to enhance binary classification. Our results show significant performance improvements with data augmentation for text and image classification models and with the fusion layer for multimodal classification. We highlight challenges and opportunities for future research in multimodal propaganda detection in Arabic content, emphasizing the need for robust and adaptable models to combat disinformation.",
    "MemeMQA: Multimodal Question Answering for Memes via Rationale-Based Inferencing": "Memes have evolved as a prevalent medium for diverse communication, ranging from humour to propaganda. With the rising popularity of image-focused content, there is a growing need to explore its potential harm from different aspects. Previous studies have analyzed memes in closed settings - detecting harm, applying semantic labels, and offering natural language explanations. To extend this research, we introduce MemeMQA, a multimodal question-answering framework aiming to solicit accurate responses to structured questions while providing coherent explanations. We curate MemeMQACorpus, a new dataset featuring 1,880 questions related to 1,122 memes with corresponding answer-explanation pairs. We further propose ARSENAL, a novel two-stage multimodal framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to address MemeMQA. We benchmark MemeMQA using competitive baselines and demonstrate its superiority - ∼18% enhanced answer prediction accuracy and distinct text generation lead across various metrics measuring lexical and semantic alignment over the best baseline. We analyze ARSENAL's robustness through diversification of question-set, confounder-based evaluation regarding MemeMQA's generalizability, and modality-specific assessment, enhancing our understanding of meme interpretation in the multimodal communication landscape.",
    "Mementos: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Model Reasoning over Image Sequences": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in handling a variety of visual-language tasks. However, current MLLM benchmarks are predominantly designed to evaluate reasoning based on static information about a single image, and the ability of modern MLLMs to extrapolate from image sequences, which is essential for understanding our ever-changing world, has been less investigated. To address this challenge, this paper introduces Mementos, a new benchmark designed to assess MLLMs' sequential image reasoning abilities. Mementos features 4,761 diverse image sequences with varying lengths. We also employ a GPT-4 assisted method to evaluate MLLM reasoning performance. Through a careful evaluation of nine recent MLLMs on Mementos, including GPT-4V and Gemini, we find that they struggle to accurately describe dynamic information about given image sequences, often leading to hallucinations/misrepresentations of objects and their corresponding behaviors. Our quantitative analysis and case studies identify three key factors impacting MLLMs' sequential image reasoning: the correlation between object and behavioral hallucinations, the influence of co-occurring behaviors, and the compounding impact of behavioral hallucinations.",
    "Mention-Agnostic Information Extraction for Ontological Annotation of Biomedical Articles": "Biomedical information extraction is crucial for advancing research, enhancing healthcare, and discovering treatments by efficiently analyzing extensive data. Given the extensive amount of biomedical data available, automated information extraction methods are necessary due to manual extraction's labor-intensive, expertise-dependent, and costly nature. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage system for information extraction where we annotate biomedical articles based on a specific ontology (HOIP). The major challenge is annotating relation between biomedical processes often not explicitly mentioned in text articles. Here, we first predict the candidate processes and then determine the relationships between these processes without relying on mentions. The experimental results show promising outcomes in mention-agnostic process identification using Large Language Models (LLMs). In relation classification, our proposed BERT-based models outperform LLMs significantly. The end-to-end evaluation results suggest the difficulty of this task and room for improvement in both process identification and relation classification.",
    "MERA: A Comprehensive LLM Evaluation in Russian": "Over the past few years, one of the most notable advancements in AI research has been in foundation models (FMs), headlined by the rise of language models (LMs). However, despite researchers' attention and the rapid growth in LM application, the capabilities, limitations, and associated risks still need to be better understood. To address these issues, we introduce a new instruction benchmark, MERA, oriented towards the FMs' performance on the Russian language. The benchmark encompasses 21 evaluation tasks for generative models covering 10 skills and is supplied with private answer scoring to prevent data leakage. The paper introduces a methodology to evaluate FMs and LMs in fixed zero- and few-shot instruction settings that can be extended to other modalities. We propose an evaluation methodology, an open-source code base for the MERA assessment, and a leaderboard with a submission system. We evaluate open LMs as baselines and find they are still far behind the human level. We publicly release MERA to guide forthcoming research, anticipate groundbreaking model features, standardize the evaluation procedure, and address potential ethical concerns and drawbacks.",
    "Merging Facts, Crafting Fallacies: Evaluating the Contradictory Nature of Aggregated Factual Claims in Long-Form Generations": "Long-form generations from large language models (LLMs) can contain a mix of factual and non-factual claims, making evaluating factuality difficult. Prior works evaluate the factuality of a long paragraph by decomposing it into multiple facts, verifying those facts independently, and aggregating the results. Such methods assume that combining factual claims forms a factual paragraph. The above assumption can be violated: we show that strong open-source models like Llama-chat can generate paragraphs that contain verifiable facts, but the facts are combined into a non-factual paragraph due to entity ambiguity. We further reveal that existing factuality metrics, including FActScore and citation recall, cannot properly evaluate these non-factual paragraphs and overestimate their factuality. To address this, we introduce an enhanced metric, D-FActScore, specifically designed for content with ambiguous entities. We evaluate the D-FActScores of people biographies generated by retrieval-augmented LLMs. We show that D-FActScore can better assess the factuality of paragraphs with entity ambiguity than FActScore. We also find that four widely used open-source LLMs tend to mix information of distinct entities to form non-factual paragraphs, making their D-FActScore much lower than FActScore by over 10%.",
    "Meta-Reasoning: Semantics-Symbol Deconstruction for Large Language Models": "Neural-symbolic methods have demonstrated efficiency in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods mainly rely on syntactically mapping natural languages to complete formal languages like Python and SQL. Those methods require that reasoning tasks be convertible into programs, which cater to the computer execution mindset and deviate from human reasoning habits. To broaden symbolic methods' applicability and adaptability in the real world, we propose the Meta-Reasoning from a linguistic perspective. This method empowers LLMs to deconstruct reasoning-independent semantic information into generic symbolic representations, thereby efficiently capturing more generalized reasoning knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments on more than ten datasets encompassing conventional reasoning tasks like arithmetic, symbolic, and logical reasoning, and the more complex interactive reasoning tasks like theory-of-mind reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Meta-Reasoning significantly enhances in-context reasoning accuracy, learning efficiency, out-of-domain generalization, and output stability compared to the Chain-of-Thought technique.",
    "Meta-Task Prompting Elicits Embeddings from Large Language Models": "We introduce a new unsupervised text embedding method, Meta-Task Prompting with Explicit One-Word Limitation (MetaEOL), for generating high-quality sentence embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for model fine-tuning. Leveraging meta-task prompting, MetaEOL guides LLMs to produce embeddings through a series of carefully designed prompts that address multiple representational aspects. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that embeddings averaged from various meta-tasks are versatile embeddings that yield competitive performance on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks and excel in downstream tasks, surpassing contrastive-trained models. Our findings suggest a new scaling law, offering a versatile and resource-efficient approach for embedding generation across diverse scenarios.",
    "Meta-Tuning LLMs to Leverage Lexical Knowledge for Generalizable Language Style Understanding": "Language style is often used by writers to convey their intentions, identities, and mastery of language. In this paper, we show that current large language models struggle to capture some language styles without fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we investigate whether LLMs can be meta-trained based on representative lexicons to recognize new styles they have not been fine-tuned on. Experiments on 13 established style classification tasks, as well as 63 novel tasks generated using LLMs, demonstrate that meta-training with style lexicons consistently improves zero-shot transfer across styles. We release the code and data at https://github.com/octaviaguo/Style-LLM.",
    "Metadata Enhancement Using Large Language Models": "In the natural sciences, a common form of scholarly document is a physical sample record, which provides categorical and textual metadata for specimens collected and analyzed for scientific research. Physical sample archives like museums and repositories publish these records in data repositories to support reproducible science and enable the discovery of physical samples. However, the success of resource discovery in such interfaces depends on the completeness of the sample records. We investigate approaches for automatically completing the scientific metadata fields of sample records. We apply large language models in zero and few-shot settings and incorporate the hierarchical structure of the taxonomy. We show that a combination of record summarization, bottom-up taxonomy traversal, and few-shot prompting yield an F1 score as high as 0.928 on metadata completion in the Earth science domain.",
    "Metaphor Understanding Challenge Dataset for LLMs": "Metaphors in natural language are a reflection of fundamental cognitive processes such as analogical reasoning and categorisation, and are deeply rooted in everyday communication. Metaphor understanding is therefore an essential task for large language models (LLMs). We release the Metaphor Understanding Challenge Dataset (MUNCH), designed to evaluate the metaphor understanding capabilities of LLMs. The dataset provides over 10k paraphrases for sentences containing metaphor use, as well as 1.5k instances containing inapt paraphrases. The inapt paraphrases were carefully selected to serve as control to determine whether the model indeed performs full metaphor interpretation or rather resorts to lexical similarity. All apt and inapt paraphrases were manually annotated. The metaphorical sentences cover natural metaphor uses across 4 genres (academic, news, fiction, and conversation), and they exhibit different levels of novelty. Experiments with LLaMA and GPT-3.5 demonstrate that MUNCH presents a challenging task for LLMs. The dataset is freely accessible at https://github.com/xiaoyuisrain/metaphor-understanding-challenge.",
    "MGKM at StanceEval2024: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Arabic Stance Detection": "Social media platforms have become essential in daily life, enabling users to express their opinions and stances on various topics. Stance detection is a task that identifies the viewpoint expressed in text toward a target subject. Despite the growing importance of Arabic tweets in shaping public opinion, there is a lack of research on stance detection in this domain. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuning three Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting target-specific stances in the MAWQIF dataset (Alturayeif et al., 2022). The LLMs assessed are ChatGPT-3.5-turbo, Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, and Falcon-7B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuning substantially enhances the stance detection capabilities of LLMs in Arabic tweets. GPT-3.5-Turbo exhibits the highest performance among the evaluated models, achieving a macro-F1 score of 82.93. Our work ranked second in the StanceEval2024 leaderboard, on a blind test set (Alturayeif et al., 2024).",
    "MIDGARD: Self-Consistency Using Minimum Description Length for Structured Commonsense Reasoning": "We study the task of conducting structured reasoning as generating a reasoning graph from natural language input using large language models (LLMs). Previous approaches have explored various prompting schemes, yet they suffer from error propagation due to the autoregressive nature and single-pass-based decoding, which lack error correction capability. Additionally, relying solely on a single sample may result in the omission of true nodes and edges. To counter this, we draw inspiration from self-consistency (SC), which involves sampling a diverse set of reasoning chains and taking the majority vote as the final answer. To tackle the substantial challenge of applying SC on generated graphs, we propose MIDGARD (MInimum Description length Guided Aggregation of Reasoning in Directed acyclic graph) that leverages Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based formulation to identify consistent properties among the different graph samples generated by an LLM. This formulation helps reject properties that appear in only a few samples, which are likely to be erroneous, while enabling the inclusion of missing elements without compromising precision. Our method demonstrates superior performance than comparisons across various structured reasoning tasks, including argument structure extraction, explanation graph generation, inferring dependency relations among actions for everyday tasks, and semantic graph generation from natural texts.",
    "MIKE: A New Benchmark for Fine-grained Multimodal Entity Knowledge Editing": "Multimodal knowledge editing represents a critical advancement in enhancing the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite its potential, current benchmarks predominantly focus on coarse-grained knowledge, leaving the intricacies of fine-grained (FG) multimodal entity knowledge largely unexplored. This gap presents a notable challenge, as FG entity recognition is pivotal for the practical deployment and effectiveness of MLLMs in diverse real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MIKE, a comprehensive benchmark and dataset specifically designed for the FG multimodal entity knowledge editing. MIKE encompasses a suite of tasks tailored to assess different perspectives, including Vanilla Name Answering, Entity-Level Caption, and Complex-Scenario Recognition. In addition, a new form of knowledge editing, Multi-Step Editing, is introduced to evaluate the editing efficiency. Through our extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that the current state-of-the-art methods face significant challenges in tackling our proposed benchmark, underscoring the complexity of FG knowledge editing in MLLMs. Our findings spotlight the urgent need for novel approaches in this domain, setting a clear agenda for future research and development efforts within the community.",
    "Mind Your Format: Towards Consistent Evaluation of In-Context Learning Improvements": "Large language models demonstrate a remarkable capability for learning to solve new tasks from a few examples. The prompt template, or the way the input examples are formatted to obtain the prompt, is an important yet often overlooked aspect of in-context learning. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of the template format's influence on the in-context learning performance. We evaluate the impact of the prompt template across 21 models (from 770M to 70B parameters) and 4 standard classification datasets. We show that a poor choice of the template can reduce the performance of the strongest models and inference methods to a random guess level. More importantly, the best templates do not transfer between different setups and even between models of the same family. Our findings show that the currently prevalent approach to evaluation, which ignores template selection, may give misleading results due to different templates in different works. As a first step towards mitigating this issue, we propose Template Ensembles that aggregate model predictions across several templates. This simple test-time augmentation boosts average performance while being robust to the choice of random set of templates.",
    "MindMap: Knowledge Graph Prompting Sparks Graph of Thoughts in Large Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, they often suffer from limitations such as difficulty in incorporating new knowledge, generating hallucinations, and explaining their reasoning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompting pipeline, named MindMap, that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance LLMs' inference and transparency. Our method enables LLMs to comprehend KG inputs and infer with a combination of implicit and external knowledge. Moreover, our method elicits the mind map of LLMs, which reveals their reasoning pathways based on the ontology of knowledge. We evaluate our method on diverse question & answering tasks, especially in medical domains, and show significant improvements over baselines. We also introduce a new hallucination evaluation benchmark and analyze the effects of different components of our method. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method in merging knowledge from LLMs and KGs for combined inference. To reproduce our results and extend the framework further, we make our codebase available at https://github.com/wyl-willing/MindMap.",
    "MINPROMPT: Graph-based Minimal Prompt Data Augmentation for Few-shot Question Answering": "Recent advances in few-shot question answering (QA) mostly rely on the power of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and fine-tuning in specific settings. Although the pre-training stage has already equipped LLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities, LLMs still need to be fine-tuned to adapt to specific domains to achieve the best results. In this paper, we propose to select the most informative data for fine-tuning, thereby improving the efficiency of the fine-tuning process with comparative or even better accuracy on the open-domain QA task. We present MINPROMPT, a minimal data augmentation framework for open-domain QA based on an approximate graph algorithm and unsupervised question generation. We transform the raw text into a graph structure to build connections between different factual sentences, then apply graph algorithms to identify the minimal set of sentences needed to cover the most information in the raw text. We then generate QA pairs based on the identified sentence subset and train the model on the selected sentences to obtain the final model. Empirical results on several benchmark datasets and theoretical analysis show that MINPROMPT is able to achieve comparable or better results than baselines with a high degree of efficiency, bringing consistent improvements in F-1 scores.",
    "Mirror: A Multiple-perspective Self-Reflection Method for Knowledge-rich Reasoning": "While Large language models (LLMs) have the capability to iteratively reflect on their own outputs, recent studies have observed their struggles with knowledge-rich problems without access to external resources. In addition to the inefficiency of LLMs in self-assessment, we also observe that LLMs struggle to revisit their predictions despite receiving explicit negative feedback. Therefore, We propose Mirror, a Multiple-perspective self-reflection method for knowledge-rich reasoning, to avoid getting stuck at a particular reflection iteration. Mirror enables LLMs to reflect from multiple-perspective clues, achieved through a heuristic interaction between a Navigator and a Reasoner. It guides agents toward diverse yet plausibly reliable reasoning trajectory without access to ground truth by encouraging (1) diversity of directions generated by Navigator and (2) agreement among strategically induced perturbations in responses generated by the Reasoner. The experiments on five reasoning datasets demonstrate that Mirror's superiority over several contemporary self-reflection approaches. Additionally, the ablation study clearly indicates that our strategies alleviate the aforementioned challenges. The code is released at https://github.com/hanqi-qi/Mirror.git.",
    "MISSCI: Reconstructing Fallacies in Misrepresented Science": "Health-related misinformation on social networks can lead to poor decision-making and real-world dangers. Such misinformation often misrepresents scientific publications and cites them as “proof” to gain perceived credibility. To effectively counter such claims automatically, a system must explain how the claim was falsely derived from the cited publication. Current methods for automated fact-checking or fallacy detection neglect to assess the (mis)used evidence in relation to misinformation claims, which is required to detect the mismatch between them. To address this gap, we introduce MISSCI, a novel argumentation theoretical model for fallacious reasoning together with a new dataset for real-world misinformation detection that misrepresents biomedical publications. Unlike previous fallacy detection datasets, MISSCI (i) focuses on implicit fallacies between the relevant content of the cited publication and the inaccurate claim, and (ii) requires models to verbalize the fallacious reasoning in addition to classifying it. We present MISSCI as a dataset to test the critical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), which are required to reconstruct real-world fallacious arguments, in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate two representative LLMs and the impact of providing different levels of detail about the fallacy classes to the LLMs via prompts. Our experiments and human evaluation show promising results for GPT 4, while also demonstrating the difficulty of this task.",
    "Mission: Impossible Language Models": "Chomsky and others have very directly claimed that large language models (LLMs) are equally capable of learning languages that are possible and impossible for humans to learn. However, there is very little published experimental evidence to support such a claim. Here, we develop a set of synthetic impossible languages of differing complexity, each designed by systematically altering English data with unnatural word orders and grammar rules. These languages lie on an impossibility continuum: at one end are languages that are inherently impossible, such as random and irreversible shuffles of English words, and on the other, languages that may not be intuitively impossible but are often considered so in linguistics, particularly those with rules based on counting word positions. We report on a wide range of evaluations to assess the capacity of GPT-2 small models to learn these uncontroversially impossible languages, and crucially, we perform these assessments at various stages throughout training to compare the learning process for each language. Our core finding is that GPT-2 struggles to learn impossible languages when compared to English as a control, challenging the core claim. More importantly, we hope our approach opens up a productive line of inquiry in which different LLM architectures are tested on a variety of impossible languages in an effort to learn more about how LLMs can be used as tools for these cognitive and typological investigations.",
    "Mitigating Biases for Instruction-following Language Models via Bias Neurons Elimination": "Instruction-following language models often show undesirable biases. These undesirable biases may be accelerated in the real-world usage of language models, where a wide range of instructions is used through zero-shot example prompting. To solve this problem, we first define the bias neuron, which significantly affects biased outputs, and prove its existence empirically. Furthermore, we propose a novel and practical bias mitigation method, CRISPR, to eliminate bias neurons of language models in instruction-following settings. CRISPR automatically determines biased outputs and categorizes neurons that affect the biased outputs as bias neurons using an explainability method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating biases under zero-shot instruction-following settings without losing the model's task performance and existing knowledge. The experimental results reveal the generalizability of our method as it shows robustness under various instructions and datasets. Surprisingly, our method can mitigate the bias in language models by eliminating only a few neurons (at least three).",
    "Mitigating Boundary Ambiguity and Inherent Bias for Text Classification in the Era of Large Language Models": "Text classification is a crucial task encountered frequently in practical scenarios, yet it is still under-explored in the era of large language models (LLMs). This study shows that LLMs are vulnerable to changes in the number and arrangement of options in text classification. Our extensive empirical analyses reveal that the key bottleneck arises from ambiguous decision boundaries and inherent biases towards specific tokens and positions. To mitigate these issues, we make the first attempt and propose a novel two-stage classification framework for LLMs. Our approach is grounded in the empirical observation that pairwise comparisons can effectively alleviate boundary ambiguity and inherent bias. Specifically, we begin with a self-reduction technique to efficiently narrow down numerous options, which contributes to reduced decision space and a faster comparison process. Subsequently, pairwise contrastive comparisons are employed in a chain-of-thought manner to draw out nuances and distinguish confusable options, thus refining the ambiguous decision boundary. Extensive experiments on four datasets (Banking77, HWU64, LIU54, and Clinic150) verify the effectiveness of our framework. Furthermore, benefitting from our framework, various LLMs can achieve consistent improvements.",
    "Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models with Self-Synthesized Rehearsal": "Large language models (LLMs) suffer from catastrophic forgetting during continual learning. Conventional rehearsal-based methods rely on previous training data to retain the model's ability, which may not be feasible in real-world applications. When conducting continual learning based on a publicly-released LLM checkpoint, the availability of the original training data may be non-existent. To address this challenge, we propose a framework called Self-Synthesized Rehearsal (SSR) that uses the LLM to generate synthetic instances for rehearsal. Concretely, we first employ the base LLM for in-context learning to generate synthetic instances. Subsequently, we utilize the latest LLM to refine the instance outputs based on the synthetic inputs, preserving its acquired ability. Finally, we select diverse high-quality synthetic instances for rehearsal in future stages. Experimental results demonstrate that SSR achieves superior or comparable performance compared to conventional rehearsal-based approaches while being more data-efficient. Besides, SSR effectively preserves the generalization capabilities of LLMs in general domains.",
    "Mitigating Data Scarcity in Semantic Parsing across Languages: the Multilingual Semantic Layer and its Dataset": "Data scarcity is a prevalent challenge in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). The insatiable hunger of LLMs for large corpora becomes even more pronounced when dealing with non-English and low-resource languages. The issue is particularly exacerbated in Semantic Parsing (SP), i.e. the task of converting text into a formal representation. The complexity of semantic formalisms makes training human annotators and subsequent data annotation unfeasible on a large scale, especially across languages. To mitigate this, we first introduce the Multilingual Semantic Layer (MSL), a conceptual evolution of previous formalisms, which decouples from disambiguation and external inventories and simplifies the task. MSL provides the necessary tools to encode the meaning across languages, paving the way for developing a high-quality semantic parsing dataset across different languages in a semi-automatic strategy. Subsequently, we manually refine a portion of this dataset and fine-tune GPT-3.5 to propagate these refinements across the dataset. Then, we manually annotate 1,100 sentences in eleven languages, including low-resource ones. Finally, we assess our dataset's quality, showcasing the performance gap reduction across languages in Semantic Parsing. Our code and dataset are openly available at https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/MSL.",
    "Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) via Language-Contrastive Decoding (LCD)": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are an extension of Large Language Models (LLMs) that facilitate processing both image and text inputs, expanding AI capabilities. However, LVLMs struggle with object hallucinations due to their reliance on text cues and learned object co-occurrence biases. While most research quantifies these hallucinations, mitigation strategies are still lacking. Our study introduces a Language Contrastive Decoding (LCD) algorithm that adjusts LVLM outputs based on LLM distribution confidence levels, effectively reducing object hallucinations. We demonstrate the advantages of LCD in leading LVLMs, showing up to 4% improvement in POPE F1 scores and up to 36% reduction in CHAIR scores on the COCO validation set, while also improving captioning quality scores. Our method effectively improves LVLMs without needing complex post-processing or retraining, and is easily applicable to different models. Our findings highlight the potential of further exploration of LVLM-specific decoding algorithms for improved multimodal performance.",
    "Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models with Instruction Contrastive Decoding": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly adept at generating contextually detailed and coherent responses from visual inputs. However, their application in multi-modal decision-making and open-ended generation is hindered by a notable rate of hallucinations, where generated text inaccurately represents the visual contents. To address this issue, this paper introduces the Instruction Contrastive Decoding (ICD) method, a novel approach designed to reduce hallucinations during LVLM inference. Our method is inspired by our observation that what we call disturbance instructions significantly exacerbate hallucinations in multimodal fusion modules. ICD contrasts distributions from standard and instruction disturbance, thereby increasing alignment uncertainty and effectively subtracting hallucinated concepts from the original distribution. Through comprehensive experiments on discriminative benchmarks (POPE and MME) and a generative benchmark (LLaVa-Bench), we demonstrate that ICD significantly mitigates both object-level and attribute-level hallucinations. Moreover, our method not only addresses hallucinations but also significantly enhances the general perception and recognition capabilities of LVLMs.",
    "Mitigating Language Inconsistency in Response Generation based on Large Language Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong instruction understanding ability across multiple languages. However, they are easily biased towards English in instruction tuning, and generate English responses even given non-English instructions. In this paper, we investigate the language inconsistent generation problem in monolingual instruction tuning. We find that instruction tuning in English increases the models' preference for English responses. It attaches higher probabilities to English responses than to responses in the same language as the instruction. Based on the findings, we alleviate the language inconsistent generation problem by counteracting the model preference for English responses in both the training and inference stages. Specifically, we propose Pseudo-Inconsistent Penalization (PIP) which prevents the model from generating English responses when given non-English language prompts during training, and Prior Enhanced Decoding (PED) which improves the language-consistent prior by leveraging the untuned base language model. Experimental results show that our two methods significantly improve the language consistency of the model without requiring any multilingual data.",
    "Mitigating Privacy Seesaw in Large Language Models: Augmented Privacy Neuron Editing via Activation Patching": "Protecting privacy leakage in large language models remains a paramount challenge. In this paper, we reveal Privacy Seesaw in LLM privacy protection via neuron editing, a phenomenon where measures to secure specific private information inadvertently heighten exposure risks for other privacy. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify the amount of targeted privacy data and the volume of edited privacy neurons as the two central triggers to this issue. To mitigate privacy seesaw, we propose Augmented Privacy Neuron Editing via Activation Patching (APNEAP), a novel framework designed to well balance model performance with privacy protection. The proposed APNEAP augments collected private data by automatically synthesizing new private data, which deactivates the first trigger to the privacy seesaw issue. Additionally, it adapts activation patching to privacy neuron editing for switching off the second trigger to the privacy seesaw problem. Experimental results show that the proposed APNEAP is capable of alleviating the privacy seesaw phenomenon and offers a more stable and reliable approach to privacy protection in LLMs than previous methods.",
    "Mitigating Reversal Curse in Large Language Models via Semantic-aware Permutation Training": "While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across diverse tasks, recent studies showcase that causal LLMs suffer from the “reversal curse”. It is a typical example that the model knows “A's father is B”, but is unable to reason “B's child is A”. This limitation poses a challenge to the advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI), as it suggests a gap in the models' ability to comprehend and apply bidirectional reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct substantial evaluation and identify that the root cause of the reversal curse lies in the different word order between the training and inference stage, namely, the poor ability of causal language models to predict antecedent words within the training data. Accordingly, permutation on the training data is considered as a potential solution, since this can make the model predict antecedent words or tokens. However, previous permutation methods may disrupt complete phrases or entities, thereby posing challenges for the model to comprehend and learn from training data. To address this issue, we propose Semantic-aware Permutation Training (SPT), which addresses this issue by segmenting the training sentences into semantic units (i.e., entities or phrases) with an assistant language model and permuting these units before feeding into the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPT effectively mitigates the reversal curse since the performance on reversed questions approximates that on the forward ones, and significantly advances the performance of existing works.",
    "MLBMIKABR at “Discharge Me!”: Concept Based Clinical Text Description Generation": "This paper presents a method called Concept Based Description Generation, aimed at creating summaries (“Brief Hospital Course” and “Discharge Instructions”) using source (“Discharge” and “Radiology”) texts. We propose a rule-based approach for segmenting both the source and target texts. In the target text, we not only segment the content but also identify the concept associated with each segment based on text patterns. Our methodology involves creating a combined summarized version of each text segment, extracting important information, and then fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate aspects. Subsequently, we fine-tune a new LLM using a specific aspect, the combined summary, and a list of all aspects to generate detailed descriptions for each task. This approach integrates segmentation, concept identification, summarization, and language modeling to achieve accurate and informative descriptions for medical documentation tasks.",
    "MLeVLM: Improve Multi-level Progressive Capabilities based on Multimodal Large Language Model for Medical Visual Question Answering": "Medical visual question answering (MVQA) requires in-depth understanding of medical images and questions to provide reliable answers. We summarize multi-level progressive capabilities that models need to focus on in MVQA: recognition, details, diagnosis, knowledge, and reasoning. Existing MVQA models tend to ignore the above capabilities due to unspecified data and plain architecture. To address these issues, this paper proposes Multi-level Visual Language Model (MLeVLM 1) for MVQA. On the data side, we construct a high-quality multi-level instruction dataset MLe-VQA via GPT-4, which covers multi-level questions and answers as well as reasoning processes from visual clues to semantic cognition. On the architecture side, we propose a multi-level feature alignment module, including attention-based token selector and context merger, which can efficiently align features at different levels from visual to semantic. To better evaluate the model's capabilities, we manually construct a multi-level MVQA evaluation benchmark named MLe-Bench. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our constructed multi-level instruction dataset and the multi-level feature alignment module. It also proves that MLeVLM outperforms existing medical multimodal large language models.",
    "MM-LLMs: Recent Advances in MultiModal Large Language Models": "In the past year, MultiModal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) have undergone substantial advancements, augmenting off-the-shelf LLMs to support MM inputs or outputs via cost-effective training strategies. The resulting models not only preserve the inherent reasoning and decision-making capabilities of LLMs but also empower a diverse range of MM tasks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey aimed at facilitating further research on MM-LLMs. Initially, we outline general design formulations for model architecture and training pipeline. Subsequently, we introduce a taxonomy encompassing 126 MM-LLMs, each characterized by its specific formulations. Furthermore, we review the performance of selected MM-LLMs on mainstream benchmarks and summarize key training recipes to enhance the potency of MM-LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for MM-LLMs while concurrently maintaining a real-time tracking website for the latest developments in the field. We hope that this survey contributes to the ongoing advancement of the MM-LLMs domain.",
    "MM-SAP: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Assessing Self-Awareness of Multimodal Large Language Models in Perception": "Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in visual perception and understanding. However, these models also suffer from hallucinations, which limit their reliability as AI systems. We believe that these hallucinations are partially due to the models' struggle with understanding what they can and cannot perceive from images, a capability we refer to as self-awareness in perception. Despite its importance, this aspect of MLLMs has been overlooked in prior studies. In this paper, we aim to define and evaluate the self-awareness of MLLMs in perception. To do this, we first introduce the knowledge quadrant in perception, which helps define what MLLMs know and do not know about images. Using this framework, we propose a novel benchmark, the Self-Awareness in Perception for MLLMs (MM-SAP), specifically designed to assess this capability. We apply MM-SAP to a variety of popular MLLMs, offering a comprehensive analysis of their self-awareness and providing detailed insights. The experiment results reveal that current MLLMs possess limited self-awareness capabilities, pointing to a crucial area for future advancement in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.",
    "MM-SOC: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models in Social Media Platforms": "Social media platforms are hubs for multi-modal information exchange, encompassing text, images, and videos, making it challenging for machines to comprehend the information or emotions associated with interactions in online spaces. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges, yet they struggle to accurately interpret human emotions and complex content such as misinformation. This paper introduces MM-SOC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of multimodal social media content. MM-SOC compiles prominent multimodal datasets and incorporates a novel large-scale YouTube tagging dataset, targeting a range of tasks from misinformation detection, hate speech detection, and social context generation. Through our exhaustive evaluation on ten size-variants of four open-source MLLMs, we have identified significant performance disparities, highlighting the need for advancements in models' social understanding capabilities. Our analysis reveals that, in a zero-shot setting, various types of MLLMs generally exhibit difficulties in handling social media tasks. However, MLLMs demonstrate performance improvements post fine-tuning, suggesting potential pathways for improvement.",
    "MMToM-QA: Multimodal Theory of Mind Question Answering": "Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand people's mental states, is an essential ingredient for developing machines with human-level social intelligence. Recent machine learning models, particularly large language models, seem to show some aspects of ToM understanding. However, existing ToM benchmarks use unimodal datasets - either video or text. Human ToM, on the other hand, is more than video or text understanding. People can flexibly reason about another person's mind based on conceptual representations (e.g., goals, beliefs, plans) extracted from any available data. To address this, we introduce a multimodal Theory of Mind question answering (MMToM-QA) benchmark. MMToM-QA comprehensively evaluates machine ToM both on multimodal data and on different kinds of unimodal data about a person's activity in a household environment. To engineer multimodal ToM capacity, we propose a novel method, BIP-ALM (Bayesian Inverse Planning Accelerated by Language Models). BIP-ALM extracts unified representations from multimodal data and utilizes language models for scalable Bayesian inverse planning. We conducted a systematic comparison of human performance, BIP-ALM, and state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4. The experiments demonstrate that large language models and large multimodal models still lack robust ToM capacity. BIP-ALM, on the other hand, shows promising results, by leveraging the power of both model-based mental inference and language models.",
    "Mobile-Bench: An Evaluation Benchmark for LLM-based Mobile Agents": "With the remarkable advancements of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have become a research hotspot in human-computer interaction. However, there is a scarcity of benchmarks available for LLM-based mobile agents. Benchmarking these agents generally faces three main challenges: (1) The inefficiency of UI-only operations imposes limitations to task evaluation. (2) Specific instructions within a singular application lack adequacy for assessing the multi-dimensional reasoning and decision-making capacities of LLM mobile agents. (3) Current evaluation metrics are insufficient to accurately assess the process of sequential actions. To this end, we propose Mobile-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of LLM-based mobile agents. First, we expand conventional UI operations by incorporating 103 collected APIs to accelerate the efficiency of task completion. Subsequently, we collect evaluation data by combining real user queries with augmentation from LLMs. To better evaluate different levels of planning capabilities for mobile agents, our data is categorized into three distinct groups: SAST, SAMT, and MAMT, reflecting varying levels of task complexity. Mobile-Bench comprises 832 data entries, with more than 200 tasks specifically designed to evaluate multi-APP collaboration scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a more accurate evaluation metric, named CheckPoint, to assess whether LLM-based mobile agents reach essential points during their planning and reasoning steps. Dataset and platform are available at https://github.com/XiaoMi/MobileBench.",
    "Modality-Aware Integration with Large Language Models for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering": "Knowledge-based visual question answering (KVQA) has been extensively studied to answer visual questions with external knowledge, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). While several attempts have been proposed to leverage large language models (LLMs) as an implicit knowledge source, it remains challenging since LLMs may generate hallucinations. Moreover, multiple knowledge sources, e.g., images, KGs and LLMs, cannot be readily aligned for complex scenarios. To tackle these, we present a novel modality-aware integration with LLMs for KVQA (MAIL). It carefully leverages multi-modal knowledge for both image understanding and knowledge reasoning. Specifically, (i) we propose a two-stage prompting strategy with LLMs to densely embody the image into a scene graph with detailed visual features; (ii) We construct a coupled concept graph by linking the mentioned entities with external facts. (iii) A tailored pseudo-siamese graph medium fusion is designed for sufficient multimodal fusion. We utilize the shared mentioned entities in two graphs as mediums to bridge a tight inter-modal exchange, while maximally preserving insightful intra-modal learning by constraining the fusion within mediums. Extensive experiments show the superiority of MAIL.",
    "Model Composition for Multimodal Large Language Models": "Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown rapid progress, moving towards the goal of creating versatile MLLMs that understand inputs from various modalities. However, existing methods typically rely on joint training with paired multimodal instruction data, which is resource-intensive and challenging to extend to new modalities. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm through the model composition of existing MLLMs to create a new model that retains the modal understanding capabilities of each original model. Our basic implementation, NaiveMC, demonstrates the effectiveness of this paradigm by reusing modality encoders and merging LLM parameters. Furthermore, we introduce DAMC to address parameter interference and mismatch issues during the merging process, thereby enhancing the model performance. To facilitate research in this area, we propose MCUB, a benchmark for assessing the ability of MLLMs to understand inputs from diverse modalities. Experiments on this benchmark and four other multimodal understanding tasks show significant improvements over baselines, proving that model composition can create a versatile model capable of processing inputs from multiple modalities.",
    "Model Editing at Scale leads to Gradual and Catastrophic Forgetting": "Editing knowledge in large language models is an attractive capability that allows us to correct incorrectly learned facts during pre-training, as well as update the model with an ever-growing list of new facts. While existing model editing techniques have shown promise, they are usually evaluated using metrics for reliability, specificity and generalization over one or few edits. We argue that for model editing to have practical utility, we must be able to make multiple edits to the same model. With this in mind, we evaluate current model editing methods at scale, focusing on two state of the art methods - ROME and MEMIT. With the lens of scalability, we evaluate model editing methods for three crucial properties - editing proficiency, fact forgetting and downstream performance. We find that as a model is edited sequentially with multiple facts, it continually becomes less editable, forgets previously edited facts and loses the ability to perform downstream tasks. For ROME and MEMIT, this forgetting happens in two phases - an initial gradual but progressive forgetting phase followed by an abrupt or catastrophic forgetting. Both gradual and catastrophic forgetting limit the usefulness of model editing methods at scale - the former makes model editing less effective as multiple edits are made to the model while the latter caps the scalability of such model editing methods. Our analysis also highlights other key limitations of ROME and MEMIT at scale. With our work, we push for better evaluation of model editing and development of model editing methods keeping scalability in mind.",
    "Modeling Uncertainty and Using Post-fusion as Fallback Improves Retrieval Augmented Generation with LLMs": "The integration of retrieved passages and large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPTs, has significantly contributed to improving open-domain question answering. However, there is still a lack of exploration regarding the optimal approach for incorporating retrieved passages into the answer generation process. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating different methods of combining retrieved passages with LLMs to enhance answer generation. We begin by examining the limitations of a commonly-used concatenation approach. Surprisingly, this approach often results in generating “unknown” outputs, even when the correct document is among the top-k retrieved passages. To address this issue, we explore four alternative strategies for integrating the retrieved passages with the LLMs. These strategies include two single-round methods that utilize chain-of-thought reasoning and two multi-round strategies that incorporate feedback loops. Through comprehensive analyses and experiments, we provide insightful observations on how to effectively leverage retrieved passages to enhance the answer generation capability of LLMs. On three open-domain question answering datasets, NQ, TriviaQA, and SQuAD, our multi-round approaches outperform the traditional concatenation approach, achieving over a 10% improvement in answer EM.",
    "MODOS at ArAIEval Shared Task: Multimodal Propagandistic Memes Classification Using Weighted SAM, CLIP and ArabianGPT": "Arabic social media platforms are increasingly using propaganda to deceive or influence people. This propaganda is often spread through multimodal content, such as memes. While substantial research has addressed the automatic detection of propaganda in English content, this paper presents the MODOS team's participation in the Arabic Multimodal Propagandistic Memes Classification shared task. Our system deploys the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and CLIP for image representation and ARABIAN-GPT embeddings for text. Then, we employ LSTM encoders followed by a weighted fusion strategy to perform binary classification. Our system achieved competitive performance in distinguishing between propagandistic and non-propagandistic memes, scored 0.7290 macro F1, and ranked 6th among the participants.",
    "MoExtend: Tuning New Experts for Modality and Task Extension": "Large language models (LLMs) excel in various tasks but are primarily trained on text data, limiting their application scope. Expanding LLM capabilities to include vision-language understanding is vital, yet training them on multimodal data from scratch is challenging and costly. Existing instruction tuning methods, e.g., LLAVA, often connect a pretrained CLIP vision encoder and LLMs via fully fine-tuning LLMs to bridge the modality gap. However, full fine-tuning is plagued by catastrophic forgetting, i.e., forgetting previous knowledge, and high training costs particularly in the era of increasing tasks and modalities. To solve this issue, we introduce MoExtend, an effective framework designed to streamline the modality adaptation and extension of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. MoExtend seamlessly integrates new experts into pre-trained MoE models, endowing them with novel knowledge without the need to tune pretrained models such as MoE and vision encoders. This approach enables rapid adaptation and extension to new modal data or tasks, effectively addressing the challenge of accommodating new modalities within LLMs. Furthermore, MoExtend avoids tuning pretrained models, thus mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of MoExtend in enhancing the multimodal capabilities of LLMs, contributing to advancements in multimodal AI research.",
    "Mol2Lang-VLM: Vision- and Text-Guided Generative Pre-trained Language Models for Advancing Molecule Captioning through Multimodal Fusion": "This paper introduces Mol2Lang-VLM, an enhanced method for refining generative pre-trained language models for molecule captioning using multimodal features to achieve more accurate caption generation. Our approach leverages the encoder and decoder blocks of the Transformer-based architecture by introducing third sub-layers into both. Specifically, we insert sub-layers in the encoder to fuse features from SELFIES strings and molecular images, while the decoder fuses features from SMILES strings and their corresponding descriptions. Moreover, cross multi-head attention is employed instead of common multi-head attention to enable the decoder to attend to the encoder's output, thereby integrating the encoded contextual information for better and more accurate caption generation. Performance evaluation on the CheBI-20 and L+M-24 benchmark datasets demonstrates Mol2Lang-VLM's superiority, achieving higher accuracy and quality in caption generation compared to existing methods.",
    "MolTC: Towards Molecular Relational Modeling In Language Models": "Molecular Relational Learning (MRL), aiming to understand interactions between molecular pairs, plays a pivotal role in advancing biochemical research. Recently, the adoption of large language models (LLMs), known for their vast knowledge repositories and advanced logical inference capabilities, has emerged as a promising way for efficient and effective MRL. Despite their potential, these methods predominantly rely on textual data, thus not fully harnessing the wealth of structural information inherent in molecular graphs. Moreover, the absence of a unified framework exacerbates the issue of insufficient data exploitation, as it hinders the sharing of interaction mechanisms learned across various datasets. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel LLM-based multi-modal framework for Molecular inTeraction modeling following Chain-of-Thought (CoT) theory, termed MolTC, which effectively integrates graphical information of two molecules in pair. To train MolTC efficiently, we introduce a Multi-hierarchical CoT theory to refine its training paradigm, and conduct a comprehensive Molecular Interactive Instructions dataset for the development of biochemical LLMs involving MRL. Our experiments, conducted across twelve datasets involving over 4,000,000 molecular pairs, exhibit the superiority of our method over current GNN- and LLM-based baselines.",
    "Monotonic Representation of Numeric Properties in Language Models": "Language models (LMs) can express factual knowledge involving numeric properties such as Karl Popper was born in 1902. However, how this information is encoded in the model's internal representations is not understood well. Here, we introduce a method for finding and editing representations of numeric properties such as an entity's birth year. We find directions that encode numeric properties monotonically, in an interpretable fashion. When editing representations along these directions, LM output changes accordingly. For example, by patching activations along a birthyear direction we can make the LM express an increasingly late birthyear. Property-encoding directions exist across several numeric properties in all models under consideration, suggesting the possibility that monotonic representation of numeric properties consistently emerges during LM pretraining.",
    "MoPS: Modular Story Premise Synthesis for Open-Ended Automatic Story Generation": "A story premise succinctly defines a story's main idea, foundation, and trajectory. It serves as the initial trigger in automatic story generation. Existing sources of story premises are limited by a lack of diversity, uneven quality, and high costs that make them difficult to scale. In response, we introduce Modular Story Premise Synthesis (MoPS) which breaks down story premises into modules like background and persona for automated design and generation. MoPS consists of three phases: (1) Pre-collect a consistent set of candidates for each module to form a nested dictionary. (2) Extract a key path from the nested dictionary as the premise design. (3) Instruct an LLM to integrate the design into a coherent premise sentence. Thorough evaluations demonstrate that our synthesized premises excel in diversity, fascination, completeness, and originality compared to those induced from large language models and captured from public story datasets. Similarly, the extended novels and scripts generated from our premises also exhibit higher quality. In supplementary materials, we provide the MoPS code suite, along with 7.6k generated premises and 1k extended stories.",
    "MORE: Multi-mOdal REtrieval Augmented Generative Commonsense Reasoning": "Since commonsense information has been recorded significantly less frequently than its existence, language models pre-trained by text generation have difficulty to learn sufficient commonsense knowledge. Several studies have leveraged text retrieval to augment the models' commonsense ability. Unlike text, images capture commonsense information inherently but little effort has been paid to effectively utilize them. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-mOdal REtrieval (MORE) augmentation framework, to leverage both text and images to enhance the commonsense ability of language models. Extensive experiments on the Common-Gen task have demonstrated the efficacy of MORE based on the pre-trained models of both single and multiple modalities.",
    "Morphology Matters: Probing the Cross-linguistic Morphological Generalization Abilities of Large Language Models through a Wug Test": "We develop a multilingual version of the Wug Test, an artificial word completion experiment that is typically used to test the morphological knowledge of children, and apply it to the GPT family of large language models (LLMs). LLMs' performance on this test was evaluated by native speakers of six different languages, who judged whether the inflected and derived forms generated by the models conform to the morphological rules of their language. Our results show that LLMs can generalize their morphological knowledge to new, unfamiliar words, but that their success in generating the “correct” generalization (as judged by native human speakers) is predicted by a language's morphological complexity (specifically, integrative complexity). We further find that the amount of training data has surprisingly little on LLMs' morphological generalization abilities within the scope of the analyzed languages. These findings highlight that “morphology matters”, and have important implications for improving low-resource language modeling.",
    "MovieSum: An Abstractive Summarization Dataset for Movie Screenplays": "Movie screenplay summarization is challenging, as it requires an understanding of long input contexts and various elements unique to movies. Large language models have shown significant advancements in document summarization, but they often struggle with processing long input contexts. Furthermore, while television transcripts have received attention in recent studies, movie screenplay summarization remains underexplored. To stimulate research in this area, we present a new dataset, MovieSum, for abstractive summarization of movie screenplays. This dataset comprises 2200 movie screenplays accompanied by their Wikipedia plot summaries. We manually formatted the movie screenplays to represent their structural elements. Compared to existing datasets, MovieSum possesses several distinctive features: (1) It includes movie screenplays, which are longer than scripts of TV episodes. (2) It is twice the size of previous movie screenplay datasets. (3) It provides metadata with IMDb IDs to facilitate access to additional external knowledge. We also show the results of recently released large language models applied to summarization on our dataset to provide a detailed baseline.",
    "MPCODER: Multi-user Personalized Code Generator with Explicit and Implicit Style Representation Learning": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential for assisting developers in their daily development. However, most research focuses on generating correct code, how to use LLMs to generate personalized code has seldom been investigated. To bridge this gap, we proposed MPCODER (Multi-user Personalized Code Generator) to generate personalized code for multiple users. To better learn coding style features, we utilize explicit coding style residual learning to capture the syntax code style standards and implicit style learning to capture the semantic code style conventions. We train a multi-user style adapter to better differentiate the implicit feature representations of different users through contrastive learning, ultimately enabling personalized code generation for multiple users. We further propose a novel evaluation metric for estimating similarities between codes of different coding styles. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach for this novel task. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/455849940/MPCoder.",
    "MrRank: Improving Question Answering Retrieval System through Multi-Result Ranking Model": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with hallucinations and outdated information. To address this, Information Retrieval (IR) systems can be employed to augment LLMs with up-to-date knowledge. However, existing IR techniques contain deficiencies, posing a performance bottleneck. Given the extensive array of IR systems, combining diverse approaches presents a viable strategy. Nevertheless, prior attempts have yielded restricted efficacy. In this work, we propose an approach that leverages learning-to-rank techniques to combine heterogeneous IR systems. We demonstrate the method on two Retrieval Question Answering (ReQA) tasks. Our empirical findings exhibit a significant performance enhancement, outperforming previous approaches and achieving state-of-the-art results on ReQA SQuAD.",
    "MT-Bench-101: A Fine-Grained Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Multi-Turn Dialogues": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has drastically enhanced dialogue systems. However, comprehensively evaluating the dialogue abilities of LLMs remains a challenge. Previous benchmarks have primarily focused on single-turn dialogues or provided coarse-grained and incomplete assessments of multi-turn dialogues, overlooking the complexity and fine-grained nuances of real-life dialogues. To address this issue, we introduce MT-Bench-101, specifically designed to evaluate the fine-grained abilities of LLMs in multi-turn dialogues. By conducting a detailed analysis of real multi-turn dialogue data, we construct a three-tier hierarchical ability taxonomy comprising 4208 turns across 1388 multi-turn dialogues in 13 distinct tasks. We then evaluate 21 popular LLMs based on MT-Bench-101, conducting comprehensive analyses from both ability and task perspectives and observing differing trends in LLMs performance across dialogue turns within various tasks. Further analysis indicates that neither utilizing common alignment techniques nor chat-specific designs has led to obvious enhancements in the multi-turn abilities of LLMs. Extensive case studies suggest that our designed tasks accurately assess the corresponding multi-turn abilities. The data and code are available at https://github.com/mtbench101/mt-bench-101.",
    "MTP: A Dataset for Multi-Modal Turning Points in Casual Conversations": "Detecting critical moments, such as emotional outbursts or changes in decisions during conversations, is crucial for understanding shifts in human behavior and their consequences. Our work introduces a novel problem setting focusing on these moments as turning points (TPs), accompanied by a meticulously curated, high-consensus, human-annotated multi-modal dataset. We provide precise timestamps, descriptions, and visual-textual evidence highlighting changes in emotions, behaviors, perspectives, and decisions at these turning points. We also propose a framework, TPMaven, utilizing state-of-the-art vision-language models to construct a narrative from the videos and large language models to classify and detect turning points in our multi-modal dataset. Evaluation results show that TPMaven achieves an F1-score of 0.88 in classification and 0.61 in detection, with additional explanations aligning with human expectations.",
    "Muffin or Chihuahua? Challenging Multimodal Large Language Models with Multipanel VQA": "Multipanel images, commonly seen as web screenshots, posters, etc., pervade our daily lives. These images, characterized by their composition of multiple subfigures in distinct layouts, effectively convey information to people. Toward building advanced multimodal AI applications, such as agents that understand complex scenes and navigate through web-pages, the skill of multipanel visual reasoning is essential, and a comprehensive evaluation of models in this regard is important. Therefore, we introduce Multipanel Visual Question Answering (MultipanelVQA), a novel benchmark comprising 6,600 triplets of questions, answers, and multipanel images that specifically challenge models in comprehending multipanel images. Our evaluation shows that questions in the MultipanelVQA benchmark pose significant challenges to the state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) tested, even though humans can attain approximately 99% accuracy on these questions. Distinctively, the MultipanelVQA benchmark features synthetically generated multipanel images specifically crafted to isolate and assess the impact of various factors, such as the layout, on MLLMs' multipanel image comprehension abilities. As a result, in addition to benchmarking the capabilities of MLLMs in understanding multipanel images, we analyze various factors of the multipanel image that affect MLLMs' performance with synthetic data and offer insights for enhancement.",
    "MuggleMath: Assessing the Impact of Query and Response Augmentation on Math Reasoning": "In math reasoning with large language models (LLMs), fine-tuning data augmentation by query evolution and diverse reasoning paths is empirically verified effective, profoundly narrowing the gap between open-sourced LLMs and cutting-edge proprietary LLMs. In this paper, we conduct an investigation for such data augmentation in math reasoning and are intended to answer: (1) What strategies of data augmentation are more effective; (2) What is the scaling relationship between the amount of augmented data and model performance; and (3) Can data augmentation incentivize generalization to out-of-domain mathematical reasoning tasks? To this end, we create two new dataset AugGSM8K and AugMATH, by complicating and diversifying the queries and sampling multiple reasoning paths from GSM8K and MATH. We obtained a series of LLMs called MuggleMath by fine-tuning LLaMA models on AugGSM8K and AugMATH. MuggleMath substantially achieves new state-of-the-art on GSM8K and MATH. A log-linear relationship and a segmented log-linear are presented between MuggleMath's performance and the amount of augmented data on GSM8K and MATH, respectively. We also find that it is weak in out-of-domain math reasoning generalization from AugGSM8K to MATH and from AugMATH to GSM8K, which suggests that augmenting queries that cover a broader range of subjects is more beneficial for generalization.",
    "MULFE: A Multi-Level Benchmark for Free Text Model Editing": "Adjusting the outdated behaviors of large language models (LLMs) after deployment remains a significant challenge. It motivates the model editing research, which is however mainly explored in a restricted task form with triple-based edit requests. Recent works have initiated a transition to a more practical and unified editing task that takes free-form text as edit requests. However, there are gaps in nuanced benchmark designs and re-evaluation of existing methods. To bridge the gaps, we introduce a multi-level benchmark for free text model editing (MULFE). The benchmark categorizes probe queries into three levels of generalization, ranging from basic literal memory to deeper understanding and reasoning. Based on the benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments across various base models, edit sizes, and editing methods, including adaptations of mainstream locate-and-edit and hypernetwork methods. The results highlight the inconsistent behaviors of edited models on different generalization levels. Higher-level generalization remains a significant challenge. Based on the findings, we propose SIDE, a simple yet effective method based on in-context distillation to enhance the generalization performance. The benchmark dataset and evaluation scripts are publicly available at http://github.com/wchrepo/mulfe.",
    "Multi-hop Database Reasoning with Virtual Knowledge Graph": "Application of LLM to database queries on natural language sentences has demonstrated impressive results in both single and multi-hop scenarios. In the existing methodologies, the requirement to re-encode query vectors at each stage for processing multi-hop queries presents a significant bottleneck to the inference speed. This paper proposes VKGFR (Virtual Knowledge Graph based Fact Retriever) that leverages large language models to extract representations corresponding to a sentence's knowledge graph, significantly enhancing inference speed for multi-hop reasoning without performance loss. Given that both the queries and natural language database sentences can be structured as a knowledge graph, we suggest extracting a Virtual Knowledge Graph (VKG) representation from sentences with LLM. Over the pre-constructed VKG, our VKGFR conducts retrieval with a tiny model structure, showing performance improvements with higher computational efficiency. We evaluate VKGFR on the WikiNLDB and MetaQA dataset, designed for multi-hop database reasoning over text. The results indicate 13x faster inference speed on the WikiNLDB dataset without performance loss.",
    "Multi-Level Feedback Generation with Large Language Models for Empowering Novice Peer Counselors": "Realistic practice and tailored feedback are key processes for training peer counselors with clinical skills. However, existing mechanisms of providing feedback largely rely on human supervision. Peer counselors often lack mechanisms to receive detailed feedback from experienced mentors, making it difficult for them to support the large number of people with mental health issues who use peer counseling. Our work aims to leverage large language models to provide contextualized and multi-level feedback to empower peer counselors, especially novices, at scale. To achieve this, we co-design with a group of senior psychotherapy supervisors to develop a multi-level feedback taxonomy, and then construct a publicly available dataset with comprehensive feedback annotations of 400 emotional support conversations. We further design a self-improvement method on top of large language models to enhance the automatic generation of feedback. Via qualitative and quantitative evaluation with domain experts, we demonstrate that our method minimizes the risk of potentially harmful and low-quality feedback generation which is desirable in such high-stakes scenarios.",
    "Multi-modal Preference Alignment Remedies Degradation of Visual Instruction Tuning on Language Models": "Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to support multi-turn queries of interchanging image and text modalities in production. However, the current MLLMs trained with visual-question-answering (VQA) datasets could suffer from degradation, as VQA datasets lack the diversity and complexity of the original text instruction datasets with which the underlying language model was trained. To address this degradation, we first collect a lightweight, 5k-sample VQA preference dataset where answers were annotated by Gemini for five quality metrics in a granular fashion and investigate standard Supervised Fine-tuning, rejection sampling, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and SteerLM algorithms. Our findings indicate that with DPO, we can surpass the instruction-following capabilities of the language model, achieving a 6.73 score on MT-Bench, compared to Vicuna's 6.57 and LLaVA's 5.99. This enhancement in textual instruction-following capability correlates with boosted visual instruction performance (+4.9% on MM-Vet, +6% on LLaVA-Bench), with minimal alignment tax on visual knowledge benchmarks compared to the previous RLHF approach. In conclusion, we propose a distillation-based multi-modal alignment model with fine-grained annotations on a small dataset that restores and boosts MLLM's language capability after visual instruction tuning.",
    "Multi-Modal Retrieval For Large Language Model Based Speech Recognition": "Retrieval is a widely adopted approach for improving language models leveraging external information. As the field moves towards multi-modal large language models, it is important to extend the pure text based methods to incorporate other modalities in retrieval as well for applications across the wide spectrum of machine learning tasks and data types. In this work, we propose multi-modal retrieval with two approaches: kNN-LM and cross-attention techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our retrieval approaches empirically by applying them to automatic speech recognition tasks with access to external information. Under this setting, we show that speech-based multi-modal retrieval outperforms text based retrieval, and yields up to 50 % improvement in word error rate over the multi-modal language model baseline. Furthermore, we achieve state-of-the-art recognition results on the Spoken-Squad question answering dataset.",
    "Multi-Objective Linguistic Control of Large Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs), despite their breakthroughs on many challenging benchmark tasks, lean to generate verbose responses and lack the controllability of output complexity, which is usually preferred by human users in practice. In this paper, we study how to precisely control multiple linguistic complexities of LLM output by finetuning using off-the-shelf data. To this end, we propose multi-control tuning (MCTune), which includes multiple linguistic complexity values of ground-truth responses as controls in the input for instruction tuning. We finetune LLaMA2-7B on Alpaca-GPT4 and WizardLM datasets. Evaluations on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method does not only improve LLMs' multi-complexity controllability substantially but also retains or even enhances the quality of the responses as a side benefit.",
    "MULTI-TASK INFERENCE: Can Large Language Models Follow Multiple Instructions at Once?": "Large language models (LLMs) are typically prompted to follow a single instruction per inference call. In this work, we analyze whether LLMs also hold the capability to handle multiple instructions simultaneously, denoted as MULTI-TASK INFERENCE. For this purpose, we introduce the MTI BENCH (Multi-Task Inference Benchmark), a comprehensive evaluation benchmark encompassing 5,000 instances across 25 tasks. Each task in the MTI BENCH involves 2 to 3 sub-tasks. As expected, we first demonstrate that MULTI-TASK INFERENCE reduces the total inference time by ×1.46 times in average since it does not require multiple inference calls. Interestingly, contrary to the expectation that LLMs would perform better when tasks are divided, we find that state-of-the-art LLMs, such as LLAMA-2-CHAT-70B and GPT-4, show up to 7.3% and 12.4% improved performance with MULTI-TASK INFERENCE compared to SINGLE-TASK INFERENCE on the MTI BENCH. We release the MTI BENCH dataset and our code at this link1.",
    "Multi-Task Transfer Matters During Instruction-Tuning": "Instruction-tuning trains a language model on hundreds of tasks jointly to improve a model's ability to learn in-context, either from task descriptions, task samples, or both; however, the mechanisms that drive in-context learning are poorly understood and, as a result, the role of instruction-tuning on in-context generalization is poorly understood as well. In this work, we study the impact of instruction-tuning on multi-task transfer: how well a model's parameters adapt to an unseen task via fine-tuning. We find that instruction-tuning negatively impacts a model's transfer to unseen tasks, and that model transfer and in-context generalization are highly correlated, suggesting that this catastrophic forgetting may impact in-context learning. We study methods to improve model transfer, finding that multi-task training—how well the training tasks are optimized—can significantly impact ICL generalization; additionally, we find that continual training on unsupervised pre-training data can mitigate forgetting and improve ICL generalization as well. Finally, we demonstrate that, early into training, the impact of instruction-tuning on model transfer to tasks impacts in-context generalization on that task. Overall, we provide significant evidence that multi-task transfer is deeply connected to a model's ability to learn a task in-context.",
    "Multilevel Analysis of Biomedical Domain Adaptation of Llama 2: What Matters the Most? A Case Study": "Domain adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) leads to models better suited for a particular domain by capturing patterns from domain text which leads to improvements in downstream tasks. To the naked eye, these improvements are visible; however, the patterns are not so. How can we know which patterns and how much they contribute to changes in downstream scores? Through a Multilevel Analysis we discover and quantify the effect of text patterns on downstream scores of domain-adapted Llama 2 for the task of sentence similarity (BIOSSES dataset). We show that text patterns from PubMed abstracts such as clear writing and simplicity, as well as the amount of biomedical information, are the key for improving downstream scores. Also, we show how another factor not usually quantified contributes equally to downstream scores: choice of hyperparameters for both domain adaptation and fine-tuning.",
    "Multilingual Instruction Tuning With Just a Pinch of Multilinguality": "As instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) gain global adoption, their ability to follow instructions in multiple languages becomes increasingly crucial. In this work, we investigate how multilinguality during instruction tuning of a multilingual LLM affects instruction-following across languages from the pre-training corpus. We first show that many languages transfer some instruction-following capabilities to other languages from even monolingual tuning. Furthermore, we find that only 40 multilingual examples integrated in an English tuning set substantially improve multilingual instruction-following, both in seen and unseen languages during tuning. In general, we observe that models tuned on multilingual mixtures exhibit comparable or superior performance in multiple languages compared to monolingually tuned models, despite training on 10x fewer examples in those languages. Finally, we find that diversifying the instruction tuning set with even just 2-4 languages significantly improves cross-lingual generalization. Our results suggest that building massively multilingual instruction-tuned models can be done with only a very small set of multilingual instruction-responses.",
    "Multimodal ArXiv: A Dataset for Improving Scientific Comprehension of Large Vision-Language Models": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel across diverse tasks involving concrete images from natural scenes. However, their ability to interpret abstract figures, such as geometry shapes and scientific plots, remains limited due to a scarcity of training datasets in scientific domains. To fill this gap, we introduce Multimodal ArXiv, consisting of ArXivCap and ArXivQA, for enhancing LVLMs scientific comprehension. ArXivCap is a figure-caption dataset comprising 6.4M images and 3.9M captions, sourced from 572K ArXiv papers spanning various scientific domains. Drawing from ArXivCap, we introduce ArXivQA, a question-answering dataset generated by prompting GPT-4V based on scientific figures. ArXivQA greatly enhances open-sourced LVLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities, achieving a 10.4% absolute accuracy gain on a multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, employing ArXivCap, we devise four vision-to-text tasks for benchmarking LVLMs. Evaluation results with state-of-the-art LVLMs underscore their struggle with the nuanced semantics of academic figures, while domain-specific training yields substantial performance gains. Our error analysis uncovers misinterpretations of visual context, recognition errors, and the production of overly simplified captions by current LVLMs, shedding light on future improvements.",
    "Multimodal Instruction Tuning with Conditional Mixture of LoRA": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in diverse tasks across different domains, with an increasing focus on improving their zero-shot generalization capabilities for unseen multimodal tasks. Multimodal instruction tuning has emerged as a successful strategy for achieving zero-shot generalization by fine-tuning pre-trained models on diverse multimodal tasks through instructions. As MLLMs grow in complexity and size, the need for parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA), which fine-tunes with a minimal set of parameters, becomes essential. However, applying LoRA in multimodal instruction tuning presents the challenge of task interference, which leads to performance degradation, especially when dealing with a broad array of multimodal tasks. To address this, this paper introduces a novel approach that integrates multimodal instruction tuning with Conditional Mixture-of-LoRA (MixLoRA). It innovates upon LoRA by dynamically constructing low-rank adaptation matrices tailored to the unique demands of each input instance, aiming to mitigate task interference. Experimental results on various multimodal evaluation datasets indicate that MixLoRA not only outperforms the conventional LoRA with the same or even higher ranks, demonstrating its efficacy and adaptability in diverse multimodal tasks.",
    "Multimodal Reasoning with Multimodal Knowledge Graph": "Multimodal reasoning with large language models (LLMs) often suffers from hallucinations and the presence of deficient or outdated knowledge within LLMs. Some approaches have sought to mitigate these issues by employing textual knowledge graphs, but their singular modality of knowledge limits comprehensive cross-modal understanding. In this paper, we propose the Multimodal Reasoning with Multimodal Knowledge Graph (MR-MKG) method, which leverages multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) to learn rich and semantic knowledge across modalities, significantly enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In particular, a relation graph attention network is utilized for encoding MMKGs and a cross-modal alignment module is designed for optimizing image-text alignment. A MMKG-grounded dataset is constructed to equip LLMs with initial expertise in multimodal reasoning through pretraining. Remarkably, MR-MKG achieves superior performance while training on only a small fraction of parameters, approximately 2.25% of the LLM's parameter size. Experimental results on multimodal question answering and multimodal analogy reasoning tasks demonstrate that our MR-MKG method outperforms previous state-of-the-art models.",
    "Multimodal Table Understanding": "Although great progress has been made by previous table understanding methods including recent approaches based on large language models (LLMs), they rely heavily on the premise that given tables must be converted into a certain text sequence (such as Markdown or HTML) to serve as model input. However, it is difficult to access such high-quality textual table representations in some real-world scenarios, and table images are much more accessible. Therefore, how to directly understand tables using intuitive visual information is a crucial and urgent challenge for developing more practical applications.  In this paper, we propose a new problem, multimodal table understanding, where the model needs to generate correct responses to various table-related requests based on the given table image. To facilitate both the model training and evaluation, we construct a large-scale dataset named MMTab, which covers a wide spectrum of table images, instructions and tasks. On this basis, we develop Table-LLaVA, a generalist tabular multimodal large language model (MLLM), which significantly outperforms recent open-source MLLM baselines on 23 benchmarks under held-in and held-out settings. The code and data is available at https://github.com/SpursGoZmy/Table-LLaVA.",
    "Multipath parsing in the brain": "Humans understand sentences word-by-word, in the order that they hear them. This incrementality entails resolving temporary ambiguities about syntactic relationships. We investigate how humans process these syntactic ambiguities by correlating predictions from incremental generative dependency parsers with time-course data from people undergoing functional neuroimaging while listening to an audiobook. In particular, we compare competing hypotheses regarding the number of developing syntactic analyses in play during word-by-word comprehension: one vs more than one. This comparison involves evaluating syntactic surprisal from a state-of-the-art dependency parser with LLM-adapted encodings against an existing fMRI dataset. In both English and Chinese data, we find evidence for multipath parsing. Brain regions associated with this multipath effect include bilateral superior temporal gyrus.",
    "MultiPICo: Multilingual Perspectivist Irony Corpus": "Recently, several scholars have contributed to the growth of a new theoretical framework in NLP called perspectivism. This approach aims to leverage data annotated by different individuals to model diverse perspectives that affect their opinions on subjective phenomena such as irony. In this context, we propose MultiPICo, a multilingual perspectivist corpus of ironic short conversations in different languages and linguistic varieties extracted from Twitter and Reddit. The corpus includes sociodemographic information about its annotators. Our analysis of the annotated corpus shows how different demographic cohorts may significantly disagree on their annotation of irony and how certain cultural factors influence the perception of the phenomenon and the agreement on the annotation. Moreover, we show how disaggregated annotations and rich annotator metadata can be exploited to benchmark the ability of large language models to recognize irony, their positionality with respect to sociodemographic groups, and the efficacy of perspective-taking prompting for irony detection in multiple languages.",
    "MultiSQL: A Schema-Integrated Context-Dependent Text2SQL Dataset with Diverse SQL Operations": "Text2SQL is a task that translates natural language into SQL statements. Context-dependent Text2SQL offers a more natural database interaction by simulating dialogues between users and databases, with CoSQL and SparC as representative datasets. Yet, these datasets struggle to accurately replicate real-world situations. To address this, we introduce MultiSQL, which extends them in three key aspects: (1) Diverse SQL Operations. We incorporate diverse SQL types such as Create, Update, and Insert to broaden the scope of SQL operations. (2) Schema-Integrated Context. We integrated query context with database schema dependencies to better depict database complexity. (3) Extended Dialogues. We expand dialogue length to better simulate long conversations and complex interactions. This multi-type, schema-integrated, context-dependent Text2SQL dataset comprises nearly 800 dialogue groups and over 9,000 interaction turns across 166 complex databases, offering a better benchmark for interactive user-database dialogue. Addressing MultiSQL's challenges, we refined evaluation metrics to better capture diverse SQL types and schema dependencies. We designed a prompt framework that leverages historical data and self-refinement to accurately capture the dependency between text queries and database structures. Experiments with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA2-7B show both the effectiveness of our strategies and the challenges of MultiSQL. The datasets is available at https://github.com/grandchicken/MultiSQL.",
    "Multistage Collaborative Knowledge Distillation from a Large Language Model for Semi-Supervised Sequence Generation": "We study semi-supervised sequence generation tasks, where the few labeled examples are too scarce to finetune a model, and meanwhile, few-shot prompted large language models (LLMs) exhibit room for improvement. In this paper, we present the discovery that a student model distilled from a few-shot prompted LLM can commonly generalize better than its teacher to unseen examples on such tasks. We find that the student is able to learn a general pattern from the high-quality pseudolabels produced by the teacher during knowledge distillation (KD), and favorably not a general pattern from the low-quality pseudolabels. Leveraging this discovery, we propose a new method, Multistage Collaborative Knowledge Distillation from an LLM (MCKD), for these tasks. MCKD first few-shot prompts an LLM to produce pseudolabels for unlabeled data. Then at each stage of an iterative KD process, a new pair of students is trained on disjoint partitions of the pseudolabeled data, and produces new and improved pseudolabels for their unseen partitions. We conduct extensive experiments on four syntactic and semantic parsing datasets and show the effectiveness of MCKD for low-resource semi-supervised sequence generation. On CRAFT biomedical parsing, for example, 3-stage MCKD with 50 labeled examples outperforms an LLM teacher and vanilla KD by 7.5% and 3.7% parsing F1, respectively, and matches the performance of supervised finetuning with 500 labeled examples.",
    "My Climate Advisor: An Application of NLP in Climate Adaptation for Agriculture": "Climate adaptation in the agricultural sector necessitates tools that equip farmers and farm advisors with relevant and trustworthy information to help increase their resilience to climate change. We introduce My Climate Advisor, a question-answering (QA) prototype that synthesises information from different data sources, such as peer-reviewed scientific literature and high-quality, industry-relevant grey literature to generate answers, with references, to a given user's question. Our prototype uses open-source generative models for data privacy and intellectual property protection, and retrieval augmented generation for answer generation, grounding and provenance. While there are standard evaluation metrics for QA systems, no existing evaluation framework suits our LLM-based QA application in the climate adaptation domain. We design an evaluation framework with seven metrics based on the requirements of the domain experts to judge the generated answers from 12 different LLM-based models. Our initial evaluations through a user study via domain experts show promising usability results.",
    "NACL: A General and Effective KV Cache Eviction Framework for LLMs at Inference Time": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have ignited an innovative surge of AI applications, marking a new era of exciting possibilities equipped with extended context windows. However, hosting these models is cost-prohibitive mainly due to the extensive memory consumption of KV Cache involving long-context modeling. Despite several works proposing to evict unnecessary tokens from the KV Cache, most of them rely on the biased local statistics of accumulated attention scores and report performance using unconvincing metric like perplexity on inadequate short-text evaluation. In this paper, we propose NACL, a general framework for long-context KV cache eviction that achieves more optimal and efficient eviction in a single operation during the encoding phase. Due to NACL's efficiency, we combine more accurate attention score statistics in PROXY-TOKENS EVICTION with the diversified random eviction strategy of RANDOM EVICTION, aiming to alleviate the issue of attention bias and enhance the robustness in maintaining pivotal tokens for long-context modeling tasks. Notably, our method significantly improves the performance on short- and long-text tasks by 80% and 76% respectively, reducing KV Cache by up to 5× with over 95% performance maintenance. The code is available at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Research/tree/master/NLP/ACL2024-NACL.",
    "Naming, Describing, and Quantifying Visual Objects in Humans and LLMs": "While human speakers use a variety of different expressions when describing the same object in an image, giving rise to a distribution of plausible labels driven by pragmatic constraints, the extent to which current Vision & Language Large Language Models (VLLMs) can mimic this crucial feature of language use is an open question. This applies to common, everyday objects, but it is particularly interesting for uncommon or novel objects for which a category label may be lacking or fuzzy. Furthermore, similar patterns of variation are observed among human speakers for highly context-sensitive expressions, such as the quantifiers 'few' or 'most'. In our work, we evaluate VLLMs (FROMAGe, BLIP-2, LLaVA) on three categories (nouns, attributes, and quantifiers) where humans show great subjective variability concerning the distribution over plausible labels, using datasets and resources mostly under-explored in previous work. Our results reveal mixed evidence on the ability of VLLMs to capture human naming preferences at generation time: while some models are good at mimicking human distributions for nouns and attributes, all of them fail to assign quantifiers, a task that requires more accurate, high-level reasoning.",
    "Narrowing the Knowledge Evaluation Gap: Open-Domain Question Answering with Multi-Granularity Answers": "Factual questions can typically be answered correctly at different levels of granularity. For example, both “August 4, 1961” and “1961” are correct answers to the question “When was Barack Obama born?”. Standard question answering (QA) evaluation protocols, however, do not take this into account explicitly and instead compare a predicted answer against reference answers of a single granularity level. In this work, we propose GRANOLA QA, a novel evaluation setting where a predicted answer is evaluated in terms of accuracy and informativeness against a set of multi-granularity answers. We present a simple methodology for enriching existing datasets with multi-granularity answers, and create GRANOLA-EQ, a multi-granularity version of the ENTITYQUESTIONS dataset. We evaluate models using a range of decoding methods on GRANOLA-EQ, including a new algorithm called Decoding with Response Aggregation (DRAG), that is geared towards aligning the answer granularity with the model's uncertainty. Our experiments show that large language models with standard decoding methods tend to generate specific answers, which are often incorrect. In contrast, when evaluated on multi-granularity answers, DRAG yields a nearly 20 point increase in accuracy on average, which further increases for rare entities, revealing that standard evaluation and decoding schemes may underestimate the knowledge encapsulated in language models.",
    "Natural Language Satisfiability: Exploring the Problem Distribution and Evaluating Transformer-based Language Models": "Efforts to apply transformer-based language models (TLMs) to the problem of reasoning in natural language have enjoyed ever-increasing success in recent years. The most fundamental task in this area to which nearly all others can be reduced is that of determining satisfiability. However, from a logical point of view, satisfiability problems vary along various dimensions, which may affect TLMs' ability to learn how to solve them. The problem instances of satisfiability in natural language can belong to different computational complexity classes depending on the language fragment in which they are expressed. Although prior research has explored the problem of natural language satisfiability, the above-mentioned point has not been discussed adequately. Hence, we investigate how problem instances from varying computational complexity classes and having different grammatical constructs impact TLMs' ability to learn rules of inference. Furthermore, to faithfully evaluate TLMs, we conduct an empirical study to explore the distribution of satisfiability problems.",
    "NaturalCodeBench: Examining Coding Performance Mismatch on HumanEval and Natural User Queries": "Large language models (LLMs) have manifested strong ability to generate codes for productive activities. However, current benchmarks for code synthesis, such as HumanEval, MBPP, and DS-1000, are predominantly oriented towards introductory tasks on algorithm and data science, insufficiently satisfying challenging requirements prevalent in real-world coding. To fill this gap, we propose NATURALCODEBENCH (NCB), a challenging code benchmark designed to mirror the complexity and variety of scenarios in real coding tasks. NCB comprises 402 high-quality problems in Python and Java, meticulously selected from natural user queries from online coding services, covering 6 different domains. Noting the extraordinary difficulty in creating testing cases for real-world queries, we also introduce a semi-automated pipeline to enhance the efficiency of test case construction. Comparing with manual solutions, it achieves an efficiency increase of more than 4 times. Our systematic experiments on 39 LLMs find that performance gaps on NCB between models with close HumanEval scores could still be significant, indicating a lack of focus on practical code synthesis scenarios or over-specified optimization on HumanEval. On the other hand, even the best-performing GPT-4 is still far from satisfying on NCB. The evaluation toolkit and development set are available at https://github.com/THUDM/NaturalCodeBench.",
    "Navigating the Dual Facets: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Sequential Memory Editing in Large Language Models": "Memory Editing (ME) has emerged as an efficient method to modify erroneous facts or inject new facts into Large Language Models (LLMs). Two mainstream ME methods exist: parameter-modifying ME and parameter-preserving ME (integrating extra modules while preserving original parameters). Regrettably, previous studies on ME evaluation have two critical limitations: (i) evaluating LLMs with single edit only, neglecting the need for continuous editing, and (ii) evaluations focusing solely on basic factual triples, overlooking broader LLM capabilities like logical reasoning and reading understanding. This study addresses these limitations with contributions threefold: (i) We explore how ME affects a wide range of fundamental capabilities of LLMs under sequential editing. Experimental results reveal an intriguing phenomenon: Most parameter-modifying ME consistently degrade performance across all tasks after a few sequential edits. In contrast, parameter-preserving ME effectively maintains LLMs' fundamental capabilities but struggles to accurately recall edited knowledge presented in a different format. (ii) We extend our evaluation to different editing settings, such as layers to edit, model size, instruction tuning, etc. Experimental findings indicate several strategies that can potentially mitigate the adverse effects of ME. (iii) We further explain why parameter-modifying ME damages LLMs from three dimensions: parameter changes after editing, language modeling capability, and the in-context learning capability. Our in-depth study advocates more careful use of ME in real-world scenarios.",
    "Navigating the OverKill in Large Language Models": "Large language models are meticulously aligned to be both helpful and harmless. However, recent research points to a potential overkill which means models may refuse to answer benign queries. In this paper, we investigate the factors for overkill by exploring how models handle and determine the safety of queries. Our findings reveal the presence of shortcuts within models, leading to excessive attention to harmful words like 'kill' and prompts emphasizing safety will exacerbate overkill. Based on these insights, we introduce Self-Contrastive Decoding (Self-CD), a training-free and model-agnostic strategy, to alleviate this phenomenon. We first extract such excessive attention by amplifying the difference in the model's output distributions when responding to system prompts that either include or omit an emphasis on safety. Then we determine the final next-token predictions by downplaying the excessive attention via contrastive decoding. Empirical results have indicated that our method has achieved an average reduction of the refusal rate by 20% while having almost no impact on safety.",
    "ne Prompt To Rule Them All: LLMs for Opinion Summary Evaluation": " Evaluation of opinion summaries using conventional reference-based metrics often fails to provide a comprehensive assessment and exhibits limited correlation with human judgments. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as reference-free metrics for NLG evaluation, their potential remains unexplored for opinion summary evaluation. Furthermore, the absence of sufficient opinion summary evaluation datasets hinders progress in this area. In response, we introduce the SUMMEVAL-OP dataset, encompassing 7 dimensions crucial to the evaluation of opinion summaries: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness, aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, and specificity. We propose OP-I-PROMPT, a dimension-independent prompt, along with OP-PROMPTS, a dimension-dependent set of prompts for opinion summary evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that OP-I-PROMPT emerges as a good alternative for evaluating opinion summaries, achieving an average Spearman correlation of 0.70 with human judgments, surpassing prior methodologies. Remarkably, we are the first to explore the efficacy of LLMs as evaluators, both on closed-source and open-source models, in the opinion summary evaluation domain.",
    "Negative Object Presence Evaluation (NOPE) to Measure Object Hallucination in Vision-Language Models": "Object hallucination poses a significant challenge in vision-language (VL) models, often leading to the generation of nonsensical or unfaithful responses with non-existent objects. However, the absence of a general measurement for evaluating object hallucination in VL models has hindered our understanding and ability to mitigate this issue. In this work, we present NOPE (Negative Object Presence Evaluation), a novel benchmark designed to assess object hallucination in VL models through visual question answering (VQA). We propose a cost-effective and scalable approach utilizing large language models to generate 29.5k synthetic negative pronoun (NegP) data of high quality for NOPE. We extensively investigate the performance of 10 state-of-the-art VL models in discerning the non-existence of objects in visual questions, where the ground truth answers are denoted as NegP (e.g., none). Additionally, we evaluate their standard performance on visual questions on 9 other VQA datasets. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that no VL model is immune to the vulnerability of object hallucination, as all models achieve accuracy below 10% on NegP. Furthermore, we uncover that lexically diverse visual questions, question types with large scopes, and scene-relevant objects capitalize the risk of object hallucination in VL models.",
    "NEO-BENCH: Evaluating Robustness of Large Language Models with Neologisms": "The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) degrades from the temporal drift between data used for model training and newer text seen during inference. One understudied avenue of language change causing data drift is the emergence of neologisms - new word forms - over time. We create a diverse resource of recent English neologisms by using several popular collection methods. We analyze temporal drift using neologisms by comparing sentences containing new words with near-identical sentences that replace neologisms with existing substitute words. Model performance is nearly halved in machine translation when a single neologism is introduced in a sentence. Motivated by these results, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to generalize to neologisms with various natural language understanding tasks and model perplexity. Models with later knowledge cutoff dates yield lower perplexities and perform better in downstream tasks. LLMs are also affected differently based on the linguistic origins of words, indicating that neologisms are complex for static LLMs to address. We will release our benchmark and code for reproducing our experiments.",
    "Neurons in Large Language Models: Dead, N-gram, Positional": "We analyze a family of large language models in such a lightweight manner that can be done on a single GPU. Specifically, we focus on the OPT family of models ranging from 125m to 66b parameters and rely only on whether an FFN neuron is activated or not. First, we find that the early part of the network is sparse and represents many discrete features. Here, many neurons (more than 70% in some layers of the 66b model) are “dead”, i.e. they never activate on a large collection of diverse data. At the same time, many of the alive neurons are reserved for discrete features and act as token and n-gram detectors. Interestingly, their corresponding FFN updates not only promote next token candidates as could be expected, but also explicitly focus on removing the information about triggering them tokens, i.e., current input. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of mechanisms specialized at removing (rather than adding) information from the residual stream. With scale, models become more sparse in a sense that they have more dead neurons and token detectors. Finally, some neurons are positional: them being activated or not depends largely (or solely) on position and less so (or not at all) on textual data. We find that smaller models have sets of neurons acting as position range indicators while larger models operate in a less explicit manner.",
    "NEUROPRUNE: A Neuro-inspired Topological Sparse Training Algorithm for Large Language Models": "Transformer-based Language Models have become ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to their impressive performance on various tasks. However, expensive training as well as inference remains a significant impediment to their widespread applicability. While enforcing sparsity at various levels of the model architecture has found promise in addressing scaling and efficiency issues, there remains a disconnect between how sparsity affects network topology. Inspired by brain neuronal networks, we explore sparsity approaches through the lens of network topology. Specifically, we exploit mechanisms seen in biological networks, such as preferential attachment and redundant synapse pruning, and show that principled, model-agnostic sparsity approaches are performant and efficient across diverse NLP tasks, spanning both classification (such as natural language inference) and generation (summarization, machine translation), despite our sole objective not being optimizing performance. NEUROPRUNE is competitive with (or sometimes superior to) baselines on performance and can be up to 10x faster in terms of training time for a given level of sparsity, simultaneously exhibiting measurable improvements in inference time in many cases.",
    "Never Lost in the Middle: Mastering Long-Context Question Answering with Position-Agnostic Decompositional Training": "While large language models (LLMs) are equipped with longer text input capabilities than before, they struggle to seek correct information in long contexts. The lost in the middle problem challenges most LLMs, referring to the dramatic decline in accuracy when correct information is located in the middle. To overcome this crucial issue, this paper proposes to enhance the information searching and reflection ability of LLMs in long contexts via specially designed tasks called Position-Agnostic Multi-step QA (PAM QA). Trained with this task, our model excels in focusing more precisely on the desired information. Experimental results show substantial improvement in Multi-doc QA and other benchmarks, surpassing state-of-the-art models by a 13.7% absolute gain in shuffled settings and by 21.5% in the passage retrieval task. We release our model and code to promote related research in the community.",
    "NewsBench: A Systematic Evaluation Framework for Assessing Editorial Capabilities of Large Language Models in Chinese Journalism": "We present NewsBench, a novel evaluation framework to systematically assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for editorial capabilities in Chinese journalism. Our constructed benchmark dataset is focused on four facets of writing proficiency and six facets of safety adherence, and it comprises manually and carefully designed 1,267 test samples in the types of multiple choice questions and short answer questions for five editorial tasks in 24 news domains. To measure performances, we propose different GPT-4 based automatic evaluation protocols to assess LLM generations for short answer questions in terms of writing proficiency and safety adherence, and both are validated by the high correlations with human evaluations. Based on the systematic evaluation framework, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of eleven popular LLMs which can handle Chinese. The experimental results highlight GPT-4 and ERNIE Bot as top performers, yet reveal a relative deficiency in journalistic safety adherence in creative writing tasks. Our findings also underscore the need for enhanced ethical guidance in machine-generated journalistic content, marking a step forward in aligning LLMs with journalistic standards and safety considerations. The evaluation framework and experimental results are expected to provide an in-depth understanding of the editorial capabilities of LLMs and speed up the development of LLMs in journalism.",
    "NICE: To Optimize In-Context Examples or Not?": "Recent work shows that in-context learning and optimization of in-context examples (ICE) can significantly improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on a wide range of tasks, leading to an apparent consensus that ICE optimization is crucial for better performance. However, most of these studies assume a fixed or no instruction provided in the prompt. We challenge this consensus by investigating the necessity of optimizing ICE when task-specific instructions are provided and find that there are many tasks for which it yields diminishing returns. In particular, using a diverse set of tasks and a systematically created instruction set with gradually added details, we find that as the prompt instruction becomes more detailed, the returns on ICE optimization diminish. To characterize this behavior, we introduce a task-specific metric called Normalized Invariability to Choice of Examples (NICE) that quantifies the learnability of tasks from a given instruction, and provides a heuristic to help decide whether to optimize instructions or ICE for a new task. Given a task, the proposed metric can reliably predict the utility of optimizing ICE compared to using random ICE.",
    "NICT's Cascaded and End-To-End Speech Translation Systems using Whisper and IndicTrans2 for the Indic Task": "This paper presents the NICT's submission for the IWSLT 2024 Indic track, focusing on three speech-to-text (ST) translation directions: English to Hindi, Bengali, and Tamil. We aim to enhance translation quality in this low-resource scenario by integrating state-of-the-art pre-trained automated speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-text machine translation (MT) models. Our cascade system incorporates a Whisper model fine-tuned for ASR and an IndicTrans2 model fine-tuned for MT. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end system that combines a Whisper model for speech-to-text conversion with knowledge distilled from an IndicTrans2 MT model. We first fine-tune the IndicTrans2 model to generate pseudo data in Indic languages. This pseudo data, along with the original English speech data, is then used to fine-tune the Whisper model. Experimental results show that the cascaded system achieved a BLEU score of 51.0, outperforming the end-to-end model, which scored 19.1 BLEU. Moreover, the analysis indicates that applying knowledge distillation from the IndicTrans2 model to the end-to-end ST model improves the translation quality by about 0.7 BLEU.",
    "NLPeople at L+M-24 Shared Task: An Ensembled Approach for Molecule Captioning from SMILES": "This paper presents our approach submitted to the Language + Molecules 2024 (L+M-24) Shared Task in the Molecular Captioning track. The task involves generating captions that describe the properties of molecules that are provided in SMILES format. We propose a method for the task that decomposes the challenge of generating captions from SMILES into a classification problem, where we first predict the molecule's properties. The molecules whose properties can be predicted with high accuracy show high translation metric scores in the caption generation by LLMs, while others produce low scores. Then we use the predicted properties to select the captions generated by different types of LLMs, and use that prediction as the final output. Our submission achieved an overall increase score of 15.21 on the dev set and 12.30 on the evaluation set, based on translation metrics and property metrics from the baseline.",
    "NLPeople at TextGraphs-17 Shared Task: Chain of Thought Questioning to Elicit Decompositional Reasoning": "This paper presents the approach of the NLPeople team for the Text-Graph Representations for KGQA Shared Task at TextGraphs-17 (Sakhovskiy et al., 2024). The task involved selecting an answer for a given question from a list of candidate entities. We show that prompting Large Language models (LLMs) to break down a natural language question into a series of sub-questions, allows models to understand complex questions. The LLMs arrive at the final answer by answering the intermediate questions using their internal knowledge without needing additional context. Our approach to the task uses an ensemble of prompting strategies to guide how LLMs interpret various types of questions. Our submission achieves an F1 score of 85.90, ranking 1st among the other participants in the task.",
    "nlp_enjoyers at TextGraphs-17 Shared Task: Text-Graph Representations for Knowledge Graph Question Answering using all-MPNet": "This paper presents a model for solving the Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) problem, focusing on the impact of subgraph extraction from a Knowledge Graph on model performance. The proposed method combines textual and graph information by adding linearized subgraphs directly into the main question prompt with separate tokens, enhancing the performance of models working with each modality separately. The study also includes an examination of Large Language Model (LLM) backbones and the benefits of linearized subgraphs and sequence length, with efficient training achieved through fine-tuning with LoRA. The top benchmark, using subgraphs and MP-Net, achieved an F1 score of 0.3887. The main limitation of the experiments is the reliance on pre-generated subgraphs/triplets from the graph, and the lack of exploration of in-context learning and prompting strategies with decoder-based architectures.",
    "Noisy Neighbors: Efficient membership inference attacks against LLMs": "The potential of transformer-based LLMs risks being hindered by privacy concerns due to their reliance on extensive datasets, possibly including sensitive information. Regulatory measures like GDPR and CCPA call for using robust auditing tools to address potential privacy issues, with Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) being the primary method for assessing LLMs' privacy risks. Differently from traditional MIA approaches, often requiring computationally intensive training of additional models, this paper introduces an efficient methodology that generates noisy neighbors for a target sample by adding stochastic noise in the embedding space, requiring operating the target model in inference mode only. Our findings demonstrate that this approach closely matches the effectiveness of employing shadow models, showing its usability in practical privacy auditing scenarios.",
    "Non-compositional Expression Generation and its Continual Learning": "Non-compositional expressions, such as idioms, are an integral part of natural language and their figurative meanings cannot be directly derived from the meanings of their component words. Considering the scenario, where these expressions form a long-tailed process in language, either because of their occurrence in corpora and/or their gradual integration into use over time, this paper studies the ability of contemporary pre-trained language models to continually learn them and generate them. Formulating this as a mask infilling task termed as CLoNE, the study probes the combined challenges of non-compositionality and their continual learning. Using a set of three diverse idiomatic expression datasets repurposed for this task, we benchmark different large pre-trained language models and different continual learning methods on the task of non-compositional expression generation. Our experiments on the CLoNE task show that pre-trained language models are limited in their ability to generate non-compositional expressions and available continual learning methods are inadequate for our proposed CLoNE task, calling for more effective methods for continual learning of non-compositionality. Our datasets and code will be available at https://github.com/zhjjn/ContinualGeneration.git",
    "Not All Countries Celebrate Thanksgiving: On the Cultural Dominance in Large Language Models": "This paper identifies a cultural dominance issue within large language models (LLMs) due to the predominant use of English data in model training (e.g., ChatGPT). LLMs often provide inappropriate English-culture-related answers that are not relevant to the expected culture when users ask in non-English languages. To systematically evaluate the cultural dominance issue, we build a benchmark of concrete (e.g., holidays and songs) and abstract (e.g., values and opinions) cultural objects. Empirical results show that the representative GPT models suffer from the culture dominance problem, where GPT-4 is the most affected while text-davinci-003 suffers the least from this problem. Our study emphasizes the need to critically examine cultural dominance and ethical consideration in their development and deployment. We show that two straightforward methods in model development (i.e., pretraining on more diverse data) and deployment (e.g., culture-aware prompting) can significantly mitigate the cultural dominance issue in LLMs.",
    "Not All Experts are Equal: Efficient Expert Pruning and Skipping for Mixture-of-Experts Large Language Models": "A pivotal advancement in the progress of large language models (LLMs) is the emergence of the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs. Compared to traditional LLMs, MoE LLMs can achieve higher performance with fewer active parameters, but it is still hard to deploy them due to their immense parameter sizes. Different from previous weight pruning methods that rely on specifically designed hardware, this paper mainly aims to enhance the deployment efficiency of MoE LLMs by introducing plug-and-play expert-level sparsification techniques. Specifically, we propose, for the first time to our best knowledge, post-training approaches for task-agnostic and task-specific expert pruning and skipping of MoE LLMs, tailored to improve deployment efficiency while maintaining model performance across a wide range of tasks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed methods can simultaneously reduce model sizes and increase the inference speed, while maintaining satisfactory performance.

    "NoteChat: A Dataset of Synthetic Patient-Physician Conversations Conditioned on Clinical Notes": "We introduce NoteChat, a novel cooperative multi-agent framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate patient-physician dialogues. NoteChat embodies the principle that an ensemble of role-specific LLMs, through structured role-play and strategic prompting, can perform their assigned roles more effectively. The synergy among these role-playing LLMs results in a cohesive and efficient dialogue generation. Evaluation on MTS-dialogue (Abacha et al., 2023; Ben Abacha et al., 2023), a benchmark dataset for patient-physician dialogues-note pairs, shows that models trained with the augmented synthetic patient-physician dialogues by NoteChat outperform other state-of-the-art models for generating clinical notes. Our comprehensive automatic and human evaluation demonstrates that NoteChat substantially surpasses state-of-the-art models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 up to 22.78% by domain experts in generating superior synthetic patient-physician dialogues based on clinical notes. NoteChat has the potential to engage patients directly and help clinical documentation, a leading cause of physician burnout (Budd, 2023).",
    "NPHardEval: Dynamic Benchmark on Reasoning Ability of Large Language Models via Complexity Classes": "Complex reasoning ability is one of the most important features of Large Language Models (LLMs). Numerous benchmarks have been established to assess the reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, they are inadequate in offering a rigorous evaluation and prone to the risk of overfitting and memorization, as these publicly accessible and static benchmarks allow models to potentially tailor their responses to specific benchmark metrics, thereby inflating their performance. Addressing these limitations, we introduce a new benchmark NPHardEval. It contains a broad spectrum of 900 algorithmic questions belonging up to the NP-Hard complexity class, offering a rigorous measure of the reasoning ability of LLMs utilizing computational complexity. Moreover, this benchmark is designed with a dynamic update mechanism, where the datapoints are refreshed on a monthly basis. Such regular updates play a crucial role in mitigating the risk of LLMs overfitting or memorizing the benchmark, promoting a more accurate and reliable assessment of their reasoning capabilities. The benchmark dataset and code of NPHardEval are available at https://github.com/casmlab/NPHardEval.",
    "NUMCoT: Numerals and Units of Measurement in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning using Large Language Models": "Numeral systems and units of measurement are two conjoined topics in activities of human beings and have mutual effects with the languages expressing them. Currently, the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mathematical reasoning, yet little attention is given to how minor changes in numbers or units can drastically alter the complexity of problems and the performance of LLMs. In this paper, we scrutinize existing LLMs on processing of numerals and units of measurement by constructing datasets with perturbations. We first anatomize the reasoning of math word problems to different sub-procedures like numeral conversions from language to numbers and measurement conversions based on units. Then we further annotate math word problems from ancient Chinese arithmetic works which are challenging in numerals and units of measurement. Experiments on perturbed datasets demonstrate that LLMs still encounter difficulties in handling numeral and measurement conversions. The code and data are available at: https://github.com/CAS-SIAT-ConsistencyAI/NUMCoT.",

We instruction-tune several large language models and then assemble various model combinations as our main system architecture for cross-lingual emotion and trigger detection in tweets. Experimental results showed that our best performing submission is an assembly of the Starling (7B) and Llama 3 (8B) models. Our submission was ranked sixth of 17 participating systems for the emotion detection subtask, and fifth of 7 systems for the binary trigger detection subtask.",
    "OceanGPT: A Large Language Model for Ocean Science Tasks": "Ocean science, which delves into the oceans that are reservoirs of life and biodiversity, is of great significance given that oceans cover over 70% of our planet's surface. Recently, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the paradigm in science. Despite the success in other domains, current LLMs often fall short in catering to the needs of domain experts like oceanographers, and the potential of LLMs for ocean science is under-explored. The intrinsic reasons are the immense and intricate nature of ocean data as well as the necessity for higher granularity and richness in knowledge. To alleviate these issues, we introduce OCEANGPT, the first-ever large language model in the ocean domain, which is expert in various ocean science tasks. We also propose DOINSTRUCT, a novel framework to automatically obtain a large volume of ocean domain instruction data, which generates instructions based on multi-agent collaboration. Additionally, we construct the first oceanography benchmark, OCEANBENCH, to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in the ocean domain. Though comprehensive experiments, OCEANGPT not only shows a higher level of knowledge expertise for oceans science tasks but also gains preliminary embodied intelligence capabilities in ocean technology.",
    "ODA: Observation-Driven Agent for integrating LLMs and Knowledge Graphs": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs) has achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks. However, existing methodologies that integrate LLMs and KGs often navigate the task-solving process solely based on the LLM's analysis of the question, overlooking the rich cognitive potential inherent in the vast knowledge encapsulated in KGs. To address this, we introduce Observation-Driven Agent (ODA), a novel AI agent framework tailored for tasks involving KGs. ODA incorporates KG reasoning abilities via global observation, which enhances reasoning capabilities through a cyclical paradigm of observation, action, and reflection. Confronting the exponential explosion of knowledge during observation, we innovatively design a recursive observation mechanism. Subsequently, we integrate the observed knowledge into the action and reflection modules. Through extensive experiments, ODA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several datasets, notably achieving accuracy improvements of 12.87% and 8.9%.

    "OLIVE: Object Level In-Context Visual Embeddings": "Recent generalist vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities across diverse multimodal tasks. However, these models still struggle with fine-grained object level understanding and grounding. In terms of modeling, existing VLMs implicitly align text tokens with image patch tokens, which is ineffective for embedding alignment at the same granularity and inevitably introduces noisy spurious background features. Additionally, these models struggle when generalizing to unseen visual concepts and may not be reliable for domain-specific tasks without further fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method to prompt large language models with in-context visual object vectors, thereby enabling controllable object level reasoning. This eliminates the necessity of fusing a lengthy array of image patch features and significantly speeds up training. Furthermore, we propose region-level retrieval using our object representations, facilitating rapid adaptation to new objects without additional training. Our experiments reveal that our method achieves competitive referring object classification and captioning performance, while also offering zero-shot generalization and robustness to visually challenging contexts.",
    "OLMo : Accelerating the Science of Language Models": "Language models (LMs) have become ubiquitous in both NLP research and in commercial product offerings. As their commercial importance has surged, the most powerful models have become closed off, gated behind proprietary interfaces, with important details of their training data, architectures, and development undisclosed. Given the importance of these details in scientifically studying these models, including their biases and potential risks, we believe it is essential for the research community to have access to powerful, truly open LMs. To this end, we have built OLMo, a competitive, truly Open Language Model, to enable the scientific study of language models. Unlike most prior efforts that have only released model weights and inference code, we release OLMo alongside open training data and training and evaluation code. We hope this release will empower the open research community and inspire a new wave of innovation.",

With traditional benchmarks becoming less challenging for these models, new rigorous challenges are essential to gauge their advanced abilities. In this work, we present OlympiadBench, an Olympiad-level bilingual multimodal scientific benchmark, featuring 8,476 problems from Olympiad-level mathematics and physics competitions, including the Chinese college entrance exam. Each problem is detailed with expert-level annotations for step-by-step reasoning. Evaluating top-tier models on OlympiadBench, we implement a comprehensive assessment methodology to accurately evaluate model responses. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4V, attains an average score of 17.97% on OlympiadBench, with a mere 10.74% in physics, highlighting the benchmark rigor and the intricacy of physical reasoning. Our analysis orienting GPT-4V points out prevalent issues with hallucinations, knowledge omissions, and logical fallacies. We hope that our challenging benchmark can serve as a valuable resource for helping future AGI research endeavors.

    "On Context Utilization in Summarization with Large Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) excel in abstractive summarization tasks, delivering fluent and pertinent summaries. Recent advancements have extended their capabilities to handle long-input contexts, exceeding 100k tokens. However, in question answering, language models exhibit uneven utilization of their input context. They tend to favor the initial and final segments, resulting in a U-shaped performance pattern concerning where the answer is located within the input. This bias raises concerns, particularly in summarization where crucial content may be dispersed throughout the source document(s). Besides, in summarization, mapping facts from the source to the summary is not trivial as salient content is usually re-phrased. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study on context utilization and position bias in summarization. Our analysis encompasses 6 LLMs, 10 datasets, and 5 evaluation metrics. We introduce a new evaluation benchmark called MiddleSum on which we benchmark two alternative inference methods to alleviate position bias: hierarchical summarization and incremental summarization.",
    "On Improving Repository-Level Code QA for Large Language Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Chat- GPT, GitHub Copilot, Llama, or Mistral as- sist programmers as copilots and knowledge sources to make the coding process faster and more efficient. This paper aims to improve the copilot performance by implementing dif- ferent self-alignment processes and retrieval- augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, as well as their combination. To test the effectiveness of all approaches, we create a dataset and ap- ply a model-based evaluation, using LLM as a judge. It is designed to check the model's abil- ities to understand the source code semantics, the dependency between files, and the over- all meta-information about the repository. We also compare our approach with other existing solutions, e.g. ChatGPT-3.5, and evaluate on the existing benchmarks. Code and dataset are available online1.",
    "On LLMs-Driven Synthetic Data Generation, Curation, and Evaluation: A Survey": "Within the evolving landscape of deep learning, the dilemma of data quantity and quality has been a long-standing problem. The recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a data-centric solution to alleviate the limitations of real-world data with synthetic data generation. However, current investigations into this field lack a unified framework and mostly stay on the surface. Therefore, this paper provides an organization of relevant studies based on a generic workflow of synthetic data generation. By doing so, we highlight the gaps within existing research and outline prospective avenues for future study. This work aims to shepherd the academic and industrial communities towards deeper, more methodical inquiries into the capabilities and applications of LLMs-driven synthetic data generation.",
    "On Measuring Faithfulness or Self-consistency of Natural Language Explanations": "Large language models (LLMs) can explain their predictions through post-hoc or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations. But an LLM could make up reasonably sounding explanations that are unfaithful to its underlying reasoning. Recent work has designed tests that aim to judge the faithfulness of post-hoc or CoT explanations. In this work we argue that these faithfulness tests do not measure faithfulness to the models' inner workings - but rather their self-consistency at output level. Our contributions are three-fold: i) We clarify the status of faithfulness tests in view of model explainability, characterising them as self-consistency tests instead. This assessment we underline by ii) constructing a Comparative Consistency Bank for self-consistency tests that for the first time compares existing tests on a common suite of 11 open LLMs and 5 tasks - including iii) our new self-consistency measure CC-SHAP. CC-SHAP is a fine-grained measure (not a test) of LLM self-consistency. It compares how a model's input contributes to the predicted answer and to generating the explanation. Our fine-grained CC-SHAP metric allows us iii) to compare LLM behaviour when making predictions and to analyse the effect of other consistency tests at a deeper level, which takes us one step further towards measuring faithfulness by bringing us closer to the internals of the model than strictly surface output-oriented tests. Our code is available at https://github.com/Heidelberg-NLP/CC-SHAP",

In this paper, we extend previous findings on disparate social norms and subtle stereotypes in wikiHow in two directions: We explore the use of fine-tuned language models to determine how audience-specific instructional texts can be distinguished and we transfer the methodology to another language, Italian, to identify cross-linguistic patterns. We find that language models mostly rely on group terms, gender markings, and attributes reinforcing stereotypes.",
    "On the Benchmarking of LLMs for Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in various Natural Language Processing tasks. For automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation in particular, LLMs have been seamlessly integrated into evaluation frameworks, and together with human evaluation, compose the backbone of most evaluations. However, existing evaluation benchmarks often rely on outdated datasets and evaluate aspects like Fluency and Relevance, which fail to adequately capture the capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art chatbot models. This paper critically examines current evaluation benchmarks, highlighting that the use of older response generators and quality aspects fail to accurately reflect modern chatbot capabilities. A small annotation experiment on a recent LLM-generated dataset (SODA) reveals that LLM evaluators such as GPT-4 struggle to detect actual deficiencies in dialogues generated by current LLM chatbots.",
    "On the Cross-lingual Consistency of Text Watermark for Large Language Models": "Text watermarking technology aims to tag and identify content produced by large language models (LLMs) to prevent misuse. In this study, we introduce the concept of “cross-lingual consistency” in text watermarking, which assesses the ability of text watermarks to maintain their effectiveness after being translated into other languages. Preliminary empirical results from two LLMs and three watermarking methods reveal that current text watermarking technologies lack consistency when texts are translated into various languages. Based on this observation, we propose a Cross-lingual Watermark Removal Attack (CWRA) to bypass watermarking by first obtaining a response from an LLM in a pivot language, which is then translated into the target language. CWRA can effectively remove watermarks, decreasing the AUCs to a random-guessing level without performance loss. Furthermore, we analyze two key factors that contribute to the cross-lingual consistency in text watermarking and propose X-SIR as a defense method against CWRA.",
    "On the Impact of Calibration Data in Post-training Quantization and Pruning": "Quantization and pruning form the foundation of compression for neural networks, enabling efficient inference for large language models (LLMs). Recently, various quantization and pruning techniques have demonstrated remarkable performance in a post-training setting. They rely upon calibration data, a small set of unlabeled examples that are used to generate layer activations. However, no prior work has systematically investigated how the calibration data impacts the effectiveness of model compression methods. In this paper, we present the first extensive empirical study on the effect of calibration data upon LLM performance. We trial a variety of quantization and pruning methods, datasets, tasks, and models. Surprisingly, we find substantial variations in downstream task performance, contrasting existing work that suggests a greater level of robustness to the calibration data. Finally, we make a series of recommendations for the effective use of calibration data in LLM quantization and pruning.",
    "On the Knowledge Attenuation in Sequential Model Editing": "Model editing has become a promising approach for precisely and effectively updating knowledge within language models. In this paper, we investigate knowledge attenuation, in which the retention of updated knowledge within the language model decreases as the number of edits increases after sequential editing. Through empirical study, we discovered that existing editing methods generally suffer from knowledge attenuation. We attribute this phenomenon to two aspects: (1) redundant parameters interference and (2) update weight disentanglement. To this end, we propose the AdaPLE method. It not only mitigates the knowledge attenuation issue but also improves the performance on existing benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the cause and mitigation of knowledge attenuation in sequential LLM editing.",
    "On the Latent Language of Multilingual Transformers": "We ask whether multilingual language models trained on unbalanced, English-dominated corpora use English as an internal pivot language—a question of key importance for understanding how language models function and the origins of linguistic bias. Focusing on the Llama-2 family of transformer models, our study uses carefully constructed non-English prompts with a unique correct single-token continuation. From layer to layer, transformers gradually map an input embedding of the final prompt token to an output embedding from which next-token probabilities are computed. Tracking intermediate embeddings through their high-dimensional space reveals three distinct phases, whereby intermediate embeddings (1) start far away from output token embeddings; (2) already allow for decoding a semantically correct next token in middle layers, but give higher probability to its version in English than in the input language; (3) finally move into an input-language-specific region of the embedding space. We cast these results into a conceptual model where the three phases operate in “input space”, “concept space”, and “output space”, respectively. Crucially, our evidence suggests that the abstract “concept space” lies closer to English than to other languages, which may have important consequences regarding the biases held by multilingual language models. Code and data is made available here: https://github.com/epfl-dlab/llm-latent-language.",
    "On the Multi-turn Instruction Following for Conversational Web Agents": "Web agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in planning and executing multi-step interactions within complex web-based environments, fulfilling a wide range of web navigation tasks. Despite these advancements, the potential for LLM-powered agents to effectively engage with sequential user instructions in real-world scenarios has not been fully explored. In this work, we introduce a new task of Conversational Web Navigation, which necessitates sophisticated interactions that span multiple turns with both the users and the environment, supported by a specially developed dataset named Multi-Turn Mind2Web (MT-Mind2Web). To tackle the limited context length of LLMs and the context-dependency issue of the conversational tasks, we further propose a novel framework, named self-reflective memory-augmented planning (Self-MAP), which employs memory utilization and self-reflection techniques. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark the MT-Mind2Web dataset, and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
    "On The Persona-based Summarization of Domain-Specific Documents": "In an ever-expanding world of domain-specific knowledge, the increasing complexity of consuming and storing information necessitates the generation of summaries from large information repositories. However, every persona of a domain has different requirements of information and hence their summarization. For example, in the healthcare domain, a persona-based (such as Doctor, Nurse, Patient etc.) approach is imperative to deliver targeted medical information efficiently. Persona-based summarization of domain-specific information by humans is a high cognitive load task and is generally not preferred. The summaries generated by two different humans have high variability and do not scale in cost and subject matter expertise as domains and personas grow. Further, AI-generated summaries using generic Large Language Models (LLMs) may not necessarily offer satisfactory accuracy for different domains unless they have been specifically trained on domain-specific data and can also be very expensive to use in day-to-day operations. Our contribution in this paper is two-fold: 1) We present an approach to efficiently fine-tune a domain-specific small foundation LLM using a healthcare corpus and also show that we can effectively evaluate the summarization quality using AI-based critiquing. 2) We further show that AI-based critiquing has good concordance with Human-based critiquing of the summaries. Hence, such AI-based pipelines to generate domain-specific persona-based summaries can be easily scaled to other domains such as legal, enterprise documents, education etc. in a very efficient and cost-effective manner.",
    "On the Representational Capacity of Neural Language Models with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning": "The performance of modern language models (LMs) has been improved by chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, i.e., the process of generating intermediate results that guide the model towards a final answer. A possible explanation for this improvement is that CoT reasoning extends an LM's computational power, as RNNs and transformers with additional scratch space are known to be Turing complete. Comparing LMs to Turing machines, however, introduces a category error—Turing machines decide language membership, whereas LMs define distributions over strings. To bridge this gap, we formalize CoT reasoning in a probabilistic setting. We present several results on the representational capacity of recurrent and transformer LMs with CoT reasoning, showing that they can represent the same family of distributions over strings as probabilistic Turing machines.",
    "On the Robustness of Document-Level Relation Extraction Models to Entity Name Variations": "Driven by the demand for cross-sentence and large-scale relation extraction, document-level relation extraction (DocRE) has attracted increasing research interest. Despite the continuous improvement in performance, we find that existing DocRE models which initially perform well may make more mistakes when merely changing the entity names in the document, hindering the generalization to novel entity names. To this end, we systematically investigate the robustness of DocRE models to entity name variations in this work. We first propose a principled pipeline to generate entity-renamed documents by replacing the original entity names with names from Wikidata. By applying the pipeline to DocRED and Re-DocRED datasets, we construct two novel benchmarks named Env-DocRED and Env-Re-DocRED for robustness evaluation. Experimental results show that both three representative DocRE models and two in-context learned large language models consistently lack sufficient robustness to entity name variations, particularly on cross-sentence relation instances and documents with more entities. Finally, we propose an entity variation robust training method which not only improves the robustness of DocRE models but also enhances their understanding and reasoning capabilities. We further verify that the basic idea of this method can be effectively transferred to in-context learning for DocRE as well.",
    "On the Role of Long-tail Knowledge in Retrieval Augmented Large Language Models": "Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) exhibits outstanding performance in promoting the knowledge capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with retrieved documents related to user queries. However, RAG only focuses on improving the response quality of LLMs via enhancing queries indiscriminately with retrieved information, paying little attention to what type of knowledge LLMs really need to answer original queries more accurately. In this paper, we suggest that long-tail knowledge is crucial for RAG as LLMs have already remembered common world knowledge during large-scale pre-training. Based on our observation, we propose a simple but effective long-tail knowledge detection method for LLMs. Specifically, the novel Generative Expected Calibration Error (GECE) metric is derived to measure the “long-tailness” of knowledge based on both statistics and semantics. Hence, we retrieve relevant documents and infuse them into the model for patching knowledge loopholes only when the input query relates to long-tail knowledge. Experiments show that, compared to existing RAG pipelines, our method achieves over 4x speedup in average inference time and consistent performance improvement in downstream tasks.",
    "On the Utility of Pretraining Language Models on Synthetic Data": "Development of pre-trained language models has predominantly relied on large amounts of datasets. However, this dependence on abundant data has limited the applicability of these models in low-resource settings. In this work, we investigate the utility of exploiting synthetic datasets acquired from different sources to pre-train language models for Arabic. Namely, we leverage data derived based on four different methods: optical character recognition (OCR), automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), and generative language models. We use these datasets to pre-train models in three different architectures: encoder-only (BERTBase), encoder-decoder (T5), and decoder-only (GPT-2). We test the capabilities of resulting models on Arabic natural language understanding (NLU) tasks using the ORCA benchmark. Our results show that utilizing synthetic data can achieve performance comparable to, or even surpassing, those trained on gold data. For example, our model based on a GPT-2 architecture trained on a combined synthetic dataset surpasses the baseline model ARBERTv2. Overall, our models pre-trained on synthetic data demonstrate robust performance across various tasks. This highlights the potential of synthetic datasets in augmenting language model training in low-resource settings.",
    "On the Vulnerability of Safety Alignment in Open-Access LLMs": "Large language models (LLMs) possess immense capabilities but are susceptible to malicious exploitation. To mitigate the risk, safety alignment is employed to align LLMs with ethical standards. However, safety-aligned LLMs may remain vulnerable to carefully crafted jailbreak attacks, but these attacks often face high rejection rates and limited harmfulness. In this paper, we expose the vulnerabilities of safety alignment in open-access LLMs, which can significantly enhance the success rate and harmfulness of jailbreak attacks. Through reverse alignment, achieved by accessing model parameters, we show the feasibility of efficiently fine-tuning LLMs to undermine their inherent safeguards. We investigate two types of reverse alignment techniques: reverse supervised fine-tuning (RSFT) and reverse preference optimization (RPO). RSFT operates by supervising the fine-tuning of LLMs to reverse their inherent values. We also explore how to prepare data needed for RSFT. RPO optimizes LLMs to enhance their preference for harmful content, reversing the models' safety alignment. Our extensive experiments reveal that open-access high-performance LLMs can be adeptly reverse-aligned to output harmful content, even in the absence of manually curated malicious datasets. Our research acts as a whistleblower for the community, emphasizing the need to pay more attention to safety of open-accessing LLMs. It also underscores the limitations of current safety alignment approaches and calls for research on robust safety alignment methods to counteract malicious fine-tuning attacks.",
    "One-Shot Learning as Instruction Data Prospector for Large Language Models": "Contemporary practices in instruction tuning often hinge on enlarging data scaling without a clear strategy for ensuring data quality, inadvertently introducing noise that may compromise model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce NUGGETS, a novel and efficient methodology that leverages one-shot learning to discern and select high-quality instruction data from extensive datasets. NUGGETS assesses the potential of individual instruction examples to act as effective one-shot learning instances, thereby identifying those that can significantly improve performance across diverse tasks. NUGGETS utilizes a scoring system based on the impact of candidate examples on the perplexity of a diverse anchor set, facilitating the selection of the most advantageous data for instruction tuning. Through comprehensive evaluations on two benchmarks, including MT-Bench and Alpaca-Eval, we show that instruction tuning with the top 1% of examples curated by NUGGETS substantially outperforms conventional methods employing the entire dataset.",
    "ONSEP: A Novel Online Neural-Symbolic Framework for Event Prediction Based on Large Language Model": "In the realm of event prediction, temporal knowledge graph forecasting (TKGF) stands as a pivotal technique. Previous approaches face the challenges of not utilizing experience during testing and relying on a single short-term history, which limits adaptation to evolving data. In this paper, we introduce the Online Neural-Symbolic Event Prediction (ONSEP) framework, which innovates by integrating dynamic causal rule mining (DCRM) and dual history augmented generation (DHAG). DCRM dynamically constructs causal rules from real-time data, allowing for swift adaptation to new causal relationships. In parallel, DHAG merges short-term and long-term historical contexts, leveraging a bi-branch approach to enrich event prediction. Our framework demonstrates notable performance enhancements across diverse datasets, with significant Hit@k (k=1,3,10) improvements, showcasing its ability to augment large language models (LLMs) for event prediction without necessitating extensive retraining. The ONSEP framework not only advances the field of TKGF but also underscores the potential of neural-symbolic approaches in adapting to dynamic data environments.",
    "Ontology-guided Knowledge Graph Construction from Maintenance Short Texts": "Large-scale knowledge graph construction remains infeasible since it requires significant human-expert involvement. Further complications arise when building graphs from domain-specific data due to their unique vocabularies and associated contexts. In this work, we demonstrate the ability of open-source large language models (LLMs), such as Llama-2 and Llama-3, to extract facts from domain-specific Maintenance Short Texts (MSTs). We employ an approach which combines ontology-guided triplet extraction and in-context learning. By using only 20 semantically similar examples with the Llama-3-70B-Instruct model, we achieve performance comparable to previous methods that relied on fine-tuning techniques like SpERT and REBEL. This indicates that domain-specific fact extraction can be accomplished through inference alone, requiring minimal labeled data. This opens up possibilities for effective and efficient semi-automated knowledge graph construction for domain-specific data.",
    "ooGLE : Can Long-Context Language Models Understand Long Contexts?": "Large language models (LLMs) are typically limited to processing texts within context-window size, which has spurred significant research efforts into enhancing LLMs' long-context understanding as well as developing high-quality benchmarks to evaluate the ability. However, prior datasets suffer from shortcomings like short length compared to the context window of modern LLMs; outdated documents that might have data leakage problems; and an emphasis on short dependency tasks only. In this paper, we present ooGLE, a Long Context Generic Language Evaluation benchmark. It features documents post-2022, with over 24,000 tokens per document and 6,000 newly generated questions spanning varying dependency ranges in diverse domains. Human annotators meticulously crafted over 1,100 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs with thorough cross-validation for a most precise assessment of LLMs' long dependency capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of representative LLMs on ooGLE. The results indicate that most LLMs have shockingly bad long context ability and fail to capture long dependencies in the context, even when their context window size is enough to fit the entire document. Our results shed light on enhancing the “true long-context understanding” ability of LLMs instead of merely enlarging their context window.",
    "OOP: Object-Oriented Programming Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models": "Advancing automated programming necessitates robust and comprehensive code generation benchmarks, yet current evaluation frameworks largely neglect object-oriented programming (OOP) in favour of functional programming (FP), e.g., HumanEval and MBPP. To address this, our study introduces a pioneering OOP-focused benchmark, featuring 431 Python programs that encompass essential OOP concepts and features like classes and encapsulation methods. We propose a novel evaluation metric, pass@o, tailored for OOP, enhancing traditional pass@k metric. Our evaluation of 23 leading large language models (LLMs), including both general and code-specialized models, reveals three key insights: 1) pass@o offers a more relevant and comprehensive assessment for OOP code generation; 2) Despite excelling in FP, code-specialized LLMs like WizardCoder lag in OOP compared to models like ChatGPT; 3) The poor performance of all advanced LLMs on our OOP benchmark highlights a critical need for improvements in this field. Our benchmark and scripts are publicly released at: https://github.com/alphadl/OOP-eval.",
    "Open (Clinical) LLMs are Sensitive to Instruction Phrasings": "Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform a wide range of tasks given natural language instructions to do so, but they are sensitive to how such instructions are phrased. This issue is especially concerning in healthcare, as clinicians are unlikely to be experienced prompt engineers and the potential consequences of inaccurate outputs are heightened in this domain. This raises a practical question: How robust are instruction-tuned LLMs to natural variations in the instructions provided for clinical NLP tasks? We collect prompts from medical doctors across a range of tasks and quantify the sensitivity of seven LLMs—some general, others specialized—to natural (i.e., non-adversarial) instruction phrasings. We find that performance varies substantially across all models, and that—perhaps surprisingly—domain-specific models explicitly trained on clinical data are especially brittle, compared to their general domain counterparts. Further, arbitrary phrasing differences can affect fairness, e.g., valid but distinct instructions for mortality prediction yield a range both in overall performance, and in terms of differences between demographic groups.",
    "Open foundation models for Azerbaijani language": "The emergence of multilingual large language models has enabled the development of language understanding and generation systems in Azerbaijani. However, most of the production-grade systems rely on cloud solutions, such as GPT-4. While there have been several attempts to develop open foundation models for Azerbaijani, these works have not found their way into common use due to a lack of systemic benchmarking. This paper encompasses several lines of work that promote open-source foundation models for Azerbaijani. We introduce (1) a large text corpus for Azerbaijani, (2) a family of encoder-only language models trained on this dataset, (3) labeled datasets for evaluating these models, and (4) extensive evaluation that covers all major open-source models with Azerbaijani support.",
    "Open Grounded Planning: Challenges and Benchmark Construction": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has increasingly drawn attention to the use of LLMs for human-like planning. Existing work on LLM-based planning either focuses on leveraging the inherent language generation capabilities of LLMs to produce free-style plans or employs reinforcement learning approaches to learn decision-making for a limited set of actions within restricted environments. However, both approaches exhibit significant discrepancies between the open and executable requirements in real-world planning. In this paper, we propose a new planning task—open grounded planning. The primary objective of open grounded planning is to ask the model to generate an executable plan based on a variable action set, thereby ensuring the executability of the produced plan. To this end, we establish a benchmark for open grounded planning spanning a wide range of domains. Then we test current state-of-the-art LLMs along with five planning approaches, revealing that existing LLMs and methods still struggle to address the challenges posed by grounded planning in open domains. The outcomes of this paper define and establish a foundational dataset for open grounded planning, and shed light on the potential challenges and future directions of LLM-based planning.",
    "Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard: Evaluating Large Language Models in Korean with Ko-H5 Benchmark": "This paper introduces the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard and the Ko-H5 Benchmark as vital tools for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in Korean. Incorporating private test sets while mirroring the English Open LLM Leaderboard, we establish a robust evaluation framework that has been well integrated in the Korean LLM community. We perform data leakage analysis that shows the benefit of private test sets along with a correlation study within the Ko-H5 benchmark and temporal analyses of the Ko-H5 score. Moreover, we present empirical support for the need to expand beyond set benchmarks. We hope the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard sets precedent for expanding LLM evaluation to foster more linguistic diversity.",
    "OpenCodeInterpreter: Integrating Code Generation with Execution and Refinement": "The introduction of large language models has significantly advanced code generation. However, open-source models often lack the execution capabilities and iterative refinement of advanced systems like the GPT-4 Code Interpreter. To address this, we introduce OpenCodeInterpreter, a family of open-source code systems designed for generating, executing, and iteratively refining code. Supported by Code-Feedback, a dataset featuring 68K multi-turn interactions, OpenCodeInterpreter integrates execution and human feedback for dynamic code refinement. Our comprehensive evaluation of OpenCodeInterpreter across key benchmarks such as HumanEval, MBPP, and their enhanced versions from EvalPlus reveals its exceptional performance. Notably, OpenCodeInterpreter-33B achieves an accuracy of 83.2 (76.4) on the average (and plus versions) of HumanEval and MBPP, closely rivaling GPT-4's 84.2 (76.2) and further elevates to 91.6 (84.6) with synthesized human feedback from GPT-4. OpenCodeInterpreter brings the gap between open-source code generation models and proprietary systems like GPT-4 Code Interpreter.",
    "OpenEval: Benchmarking Chinese LLMs across Capability, Alignment and Safety": "The rapid development of Chinese large language models (LLMs) poses big challenges for efficient LLM evaluation. While current initiatives have introduced new benchmarks or evaluation platforms for assessing Chinese LLMs, many of these focus primarily on capabilities, usually overlooking potential alignment and safety issues. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEval, an evaluation testbed that benchmarks Chinese LLMs across capability, alignment and safety. For capability assessment, we include 12 benchmark datasets to evaluate Chinese LLMs from 4 sub-dimensions: NLP tasks, disciplinary knowledge, commonsense reasoning and mathematical reasoning. For alignment assessment, OpenEval contains 7 datasets that examine the bias, offensiveness and illegality in the outputs yielded by Chinese LLMs. To evaluate safety, especially anticipated risks (e.g., power-seeking, self-awareness) of advanced LLMs, we include 6 datasets. In addition to these benchmarks, we have implemented a phased public evaluation and benchmark update strategy to ensure that OpenEval is in line with the development of Chinese LLMs or even able to provide cutting-edge benchmark datasets to guide the development of Chinese LLMs. In our first public evaluation, we have tested a range of Chinese LLMs, spanning from 7B to 72B parameters, including both open-source and proprietary models. Evaluation results indicate that while Chinese LLMs have shown impressive performance in certain tasks, more attention should be directed towards broader aspects such as commonsense reasoning, alignment, and safety.",
    "OpenToM: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Theory-of-Mind Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models": "Neural Theory-of-Mind (N-ToM), machine's ability to understand and keep track of the mental states of others, is pivotal in developing socially intelligent agents. However, prevalent N-ToM benchmarks have several shortcomings, including the presence of ambiguous and artificial narratives, absence of personality traits and preferences, a lack of questions addressing characters' psychological mental states, and limited diversity in the questions posed. In response to these issues, we construct OpenToM, a new benchmark for assessing N-ToM with (1) longer and clearer narrative stories, (2) characters with explicit personality traits, (3) actions that are triggered by character intentions, and (4) questions designed to challenge LLMs' capabilities of modeling characters' mental states of both the physical and psychological world. Using OpenToM, we reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs thrive at modeling certain aspects of mental states in the physical world but fall short when tracking characters' mental states in the psychological world.",
    "OpenWebAgent: An Open Toolkit to Enable Web Agents on Large Language Models": "We introduce OpenWebAgent, an open toolkit designed to optimize web automation by integrating both large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs). This toolkit focuses on enhancing human-computer interactions on the web, simplifying complex tasks through an advanced HTML parser, a rapid action generation module, and an intuitive user interface. At the core of OpenWebAgent is an innovative web agent framework that uses a modular design to allow developers to seamlessly integrate a variety of models and tools to process web information and automate tasks on the web. This enables the development of powerful, task-oriented web agents, significantly enhancing user experience and operational efficiency on the web. The OpenWebAgent framework, Chrome plugin, and demo video are available at https://github.com/THUDM/OpenWebAgent/.",
    "OPEx: A Component-Wise Analysis of LLM-Centric Agents in Embodied Instruction Following": "Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) is a crucial task in embodied learning, requiring agents to interact with their environment through egocentric observations to fulfill natural language instructions. Recent advancements have seen a surge in employing large language models (LLMs) within a framework-centric approach to enhance performance in embodied learning tasks, including EIF. Despite these efforts, there exists a lack of a unified understanding regarding the impact of various components—ranging from visual perception to action execution—on task performance.  To address this gap, we introduce OPEx, a comprehensive framework that delineates the core components essential for solving embodied learning tasks: Observer, Planner, and Executor. Through extensive evaluations, we provide a deep analysis of how each component influences EIF task performance. Furthermore, we innovate within this space by deploying a multi-agent LLM communication strategy on a TextWorld counterpart, further enhancing task performance. Our findings reveal that LLM-centric design markedly improves EIF outcomes, identify visual perception and low-level action execution as critical bottlenecks, and demonstrate that augmenting LLMs with a multi-agent framework further elevates performance.",
    "Optimizing Multimodal Large Language Models for Detection of Alcohol Advertisements via Adaptive Prompting": "Adolescents exposed to advertisements promoting addictive substances exhibit a higher likelihood of subsequent substance use. The predominant source for youth exposure to such advertisements is through online content accessed via smartphones. Detecting these advertisements is crucial for establishing and maintaining a safer online environment for young people. In our study, we utilized Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to identify addictive substance advertisements in digital media. The performance of MLLMs depends on the quality of the prompt used to instruct the model. To optimize our prompts, an adaptive prompt engineering approach was implemented, leveraging a genetic algorithm to refine and enhance the prompts. To evaluate the model's performance, we augmented the RICO dataset, consisting of Android user interface screenshots, by superimposing alcohol ads onto them. Our results indicate that the MLLM can detect advertisements promoting alcohol with a 0.94 accuracy and a 0.94 F1 score.",
    "Outdated Issue Aware Decoding for Reasoning Questions on Edited Knowledge": "Recently, Knowledge Editing has received increasing attention, since it could update the specific knowledge from outdated ones in pre-trained models without re-training. However, as pointed out by recent studies, existing related methods tend to merely memorize the superficial word composition of the edited knowledge, rather than truly learning and absorbing it. Consequently, on the reasoning questions, we discover that existing methods struggle to utilize the edited knowledge to reason the new answer, and tend to retain outdated responses, which are generated by the original models utilizing original knowledge. Nevertheless, the outdated responses are unexpected for the correct answers to reasoning questions, which we named as the outdated issue. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective decoding strategy, i.e., outDated ISsue aware deCOding (DISCO), to enhance the performance of edited models on reasoning questions. Specifically, we capture the difference in the probability distribution between the original and edited models. Further, we amplify the difference of the token prediction in the edited model to alleviate the outdated issue, and thus enhance the model performance w.r.t the edited knowledge. Experimental results suggest that applying DISCO could enhance edited models to reason, e.g., on reasoning questions, DISCO outperforms the prior SOTA method by 12.99 F1 scores, and reduces the ratio of the outdated issue to 5.78% on the zsRE dataset.",
    "Overview of the BioLaySumm 2024 Shared Task on the Lay Summarization of Biomedical Research Articles": "This paper presents the setup and results of the second edition of the BioLaySumm shared task on the Lay Summarisation of Biomedical Research Articles, hosted at the BioNLP Workshop at ACL 2024. In this task edition, we aim to build on the first edition's success by further increasing research interest in this important task and encouraging participants to explore novel approaches that will help advance the state-of-the-art. Encouragingly, we found research interest in the task to be high, with this edition of the task attracting a total of 53 participating teams, a significant increase in engagement from the previous edition. Overall, our results show that a broad range of innovative approaches were adopted by task participants, with a predictable shift towards the use of Large Language Models (LLMs).",
    "P-TA: Using Proximal Policy Optimization to Enhance Tabular Data Augmentation via Large Language Models": "A multitude of industries depend on accurate and reasonable tabular data augmentation for their business processes. Contemporary methodologies in generating tabular data revolve around utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) or fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLM). However, GAN-based approaches are documented to produce samples with common-sense errors attributed to the absence of external knowledge. On the other hand, LLM-based methods exhibit a limited capacity to capture the disparities between synthesized and actual data distribution due to the absence of feedback from a discriminator during training. Furthermore, the decoding of LLM-based generation introduces gradient breakpoints, impeding the backpropagation of loss from a discriminator, thereby complicating the integration of these two approaches. To solve this challenge, we propose using proximal policy optimization (PPO) to apply GANs, guiding LLMs to enhance the probability distribution of tabular features. This approach enables the utilization of LLMs as generators for GANs in synthesizing tabular data. Our experiments demonstrate that PPO leads to an approximately 4% improvement in the accuracy of models trained on synthetically generated data over state-of-the-art across three real-world datasets.",
    "P4: Plug-and-Play Discrete Prompting for Large Language Models": "Empowering Large Language Models (LLMs) with distinct human-like personality traits has become an innovative task for developing advanced dialog systems. Although LLMs demonstrate impressive capabilities in following instructions, directly prompting them to exhibit certain personalities through manually crafted instructions may result in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play prompting method to manipulate the LLMs' personality traits. Specifically, we append discrete personalized suffixes, automatically generated through an aggregated gradient-based search method, to the user query or dialog histories and induce LLMs to respond with target personalities. In addition, due to the high redundancy of the search space, we adopt a reward-based strategy to prune the vocabulary and focus exclusively on influential tokens. Experiment results on four models ranging from 1.1B to 13B show that our method achieves 79.9% accuracy in customizing LLMs' personalities, significantly outperforming other prompting methods (65.5%) and model editing methods. Our method also excels in generation fluency and quality with the lowest generation perplexity and the highest GPT-4 evaluation scores.",
    "PACE: Improving Prompt with Actor-Critic Editing for Large Language Model": "Large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable potential across various tasks by conditioning on prompts. However, the quality of different human-written prompts leads to substantial discrepancies in LLMs' performance, and improving prompts usually necessitates considerable human effort and expertise. To this end, this paper proposes Prompt with Actor-Critic Editing (PACE) for LLMs to enable automatic prompt editing. Drawing inspiration from the actor-critic algorithm in reinforcement learning, PACE leverages LLMs as the dual roles of actors and critics, conceptualizing prompt as a type of policy. PACE refines prompt, taking into account the feedback from both actors performing prompt and critics criticizing response. This process helps LLMs better align prompt to a specific task, thanks to real responses and thinking from LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on 24 instruction induction tasks and 21 big-bench tasks. Experimental results indicate that PACE elevates the relative performance of medium/low-quality human-written prompts by up to 98%, which has comparable performance to high-quality human-written prompts. Moreover, PACE also exhibits notable efficacy for prompt generation.",
    "PACIT: Unlocking the Power of Examples for Better In-Context Instruction Tuning": "Instruction tuning enhances the instruction following ability of large language models by finetuning with supervised instruction data. Previous work proposes in-context instruction tuning (ICIT) where specific positive or negative examples are incorporated into the prompt for better performance. In this work, we propose PACIT, a simple and effective in-context instruction tuning method, inspired by the pedagogical concept of desirable difficulty. The PACIT method unlocks the power of examples by encouraging the model to actively learn to grasp the distinctions between the positive and negative examples instead of merely reading. The model is expected to first verify the correctness of the provided example according to the task description, which is then set as the condition for generating a better response to the task instance. Our extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of PacIT, outperforming ICIT baseline on both in-domain and out-domain tasks up to 9.16 and 3.14 average ROUGE-L scores, respectively. Moreover, PACIT can notably enhance the performance of instruction tuning even when all positive and negative examples are generated with a self-instruct method.",
    "PAGED: A Benchmark for Procedural Graphs Extraction from Documents": "Automatic extraction of procedural graphs from documents creates a low-cost way for users to easily understand a complex procedure by skimming visual graphs. Despite the progress in recent studies, it remains unanswered: whether the existing studies have well solved this task (Q1) and whether the emerging large language models (LLMs) can bring new opportunities to this task (Q2). To this end, we propose a new benchmark PAGED, equipped with a large high-quality dataset and standard evaluations. It investigates five state-of-the-art baselines, revealing that they fail to extract optimal procedural graphs well because of their heavy reliance on hand-written rules and limited available data. We further involve three advanced LLMs in PAGED and enhance them with a novel self-refine strategy. The results point out the advantages of LLMs in identifying textual elements and their gaps in building logical structures. We hope PAGED can serve as a major landmark for automatic procedural graph extraction and the investigations in PAGED can provide valuable insights into the research on logical reasoning among non-sequential elements. The code and dataset are available in https://github.com/SCUNLP/PAGED.",
    "PANDA: Preference Adaptation for Enhancing Domain-Specific Abilities of LLMs": "While Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable capabilities across various natural language tasks, they often fall short of the performance achieved by domain-specific state-of-the-art models. One potential approach to enhance domain-specific capabilities of LLMs involves fine-tuning them using corresponding datasets. However, this method can be both resource and time-intensive, and not applicable to closed-source commercial LLMs. In this paper, we propose Preference Adaptation for Enhancing Domain-specific Abilities of LLMs (PANDA), a method designed to augment the domain-specific capabilities of LLMs by leveraging insights from the response preference of expert models without requiring fine-tuning. Our experimental results reveal that PANDA significantly enhances the domain-specific ability of LLMs on text classification and interactive decision tasks. Moreover, LLM with PANDA even outperforms the expert model that being learned on 4 tasks of ScienceWorld. This finding highlights the potential of exploring tuning-free approaches to achieve weak-to-strong generalization.",
    "PARADISE: Evaluating Implicit Planning Skills of Language Models with Procedural Warnings and Tips Dataset": "Recently, there has been growing interest within the community regarding whether large language models are capable of planning or executing plans. However, most prior studies use LLMs to generate high-level plans for simplified scenarios lacking linguistic complexity and domain diversity, limiting analysis of their planning abilities. These setups constrain evaluation methods (e.g., predefined action space), architectural choices (e.g., only generative models), and overlook the linguistic nuances essential for realistic analysis. To tackle this, we present PARADISE, an abductive reasoning task using Q&A format on practical procedural text sourced from wikiHow. It involves warning and tip inference tasks directly associated with goals, excluding intermediary steps, with the aim of testing the ability of the models to infer implicit knowledge of the plan solely from the given goal. Our experiments, utilizing fine-tuned language models and zero-shot prompting, reveal the effectiveness of task-specific small models over large language models in most scenarios. Despite advancements, all models fall short of human performance. Notably, our analysis uncovers intriguing insights, such as variations in model behavior with dropped keywords, struggles of BERT-family and GPT-4 with physical and abstract goals, and the proposed tasks offering valuable prior knowledge for other unseen procedural tasks. The PARADISE dataset and associated resources are publicly available for further research exploration with https://github.com/GGLAB-KU/paradise.",
    "Parallel Structures in Pre-training Data Yield In-Context Learning": "Pre-trained language models (LMs) are capable of in-context learning (ICL): they can adapt to a task with only a few examples given in the prompt without any parameter update. However, it is unclear where this capability comes from as there is a stark distribution shift between pre-training text and ICL prompts. In this work, we study what patterns of the pre-training data contribute to ICL. We find that LMs' ICL ability depends on parallel structures in the pre-training data—pairs of phrases following similar templates in the same context window. Specifically, we detect parallel structures by checking whether training on one phrase improves prediction of the other, and conduct ablation experiments to study their effect on ICL. We show that removing parallel structures in the pre-training data reduces LMs' ICL accuracy by 51% (vs 2% from random ablation). This drop persists even when excluding common patterns such as n-gram repetitions and long-range dependency, showing the diversity and generality of parallel structures. A closer look at the detected parallel structures indicates that they cover diverse linguistic tasks and span long distances in the data.",
    "Parameter-Efficient Detoxification with Contrastive Decoding": "The field of natural language generation has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, including the development of controllable text generation techniques. However, controlling the attributes of the generated text remains a challenge, especially when aiming to avoid undesirable behavior such as toxicity. In this work, we introduce Detoxification Generator (DETOXIGEN), an inference-time algorithm that steers the generation away from unwanted styles. DETOXIGEN is an ensemble of a pre-trained language model (generator) and a detoxifier. The detoxifier is trained intentionally on the toxic data representative of the undesirable attribute, encouraging it to generate text in that style exclusively. During the actual generation, we use the trained detoxifier to produce undesirable tokens for the generator to contrast against at each decoding step. This approach directly informs the generator to avoid generating tokens that the detoxifier considers highly likely. We evaluate DETOXIGEN on the commonly used REALTOXICITYPROMPTS benchmark (Gehman et al., 2020) with various language models as generators. We find that it significantly outperforms previous approaches in detoxification metrics while not compromising on the generation quality. Moreover, the detoxifier is obtained by soft prompt-tuning using the same backbone language model as the generator. Hence, DETOXIGEN requires only a tiny amount of extra weights from the virtual tokens of the detoxifier to be loaded into GPU memory while decoding, making it a promising lightweight, practical, and parameter-efficient detoxification strategy.",
    "Pareto Optimal Learning for Estimating Large Language Model Errors": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in many applications. When a concrete and precise answer is desired, it is important to have a quantitative estimation of the potential error rate. However, this can be challenging due to the text-in-text-out nature of generative models. We present a method based on Pareto optimization that generates a risk score to estimate the probability of error in an LLM response by integrating multiple sources of information. We prove theoretically that the error estimator optimized in our framework aligns with the LLM and the information sources in a Pareto optimal manner. Experimental results show that the risk scores estimated by our method are well correlated with the true LLM error rate, thus facilitating error correction. By dynamically combining with prompting strategies such as self-verification and information retrieval, we demonstrate the proposed method can be utilized to increase the performance of an LLM, surpassing state-of-the-art task specific models.",
    "Parrot: Enhancing Multi-Turn Instruction Following for Large Language Models": "Humans often interact with large language models (LLMs) in multi-turn interaction to obtain desired answers or more information. However, most existing studies overlook the multi-turn instruction following ability of LLMs, in terms of training dataset, training method, and evaluation benchmark. In this paper, we introduce Parrot, a solution aiming to enhance multi-turn instruction following for LLMs. First, we introduce an efficient but effective method for collecting multi-turn instructions that feature human-like queries, such as anaphora and ellipsis. Second, we propose a context-aware preference optimization strategy to further enhance LLMs for complex queries in multi-turn interaction. Moreover, to quantitatively evaluate LLMs in multi-turn instruction following, we manually build a multi-turn benchmark derived from existing ones. Extensive experiments show that Parrot improves current LLMs by up to 7.2% in multi-turn instruction following. Our dataset and codes will be open-sourced to facilitate future research.",
    "PAT-Questions: A Self-Updating Benchmark for Present-Anchored Temporal Question-Answering": "Existing work on Temporal Question Answering (TQA) has predominantly focused on questions anchored to specific timestamps or events (e.g. 'Who was the US president in 1970?'). Little work has studied questions whose temporal context is relative to the present time (e.g. 'Who was the previous US president?'). We refer to this problem as Present-Anchored Temporal QA (PATQA). PATQA poses unique challenges: (1) large language models (LLMs) may have outdated knowledge, (2) complex temporal relationships (e.g. 'before', 'previous') are hard to reason, (3) multi-hop reasoning may be required, and (4) the gold answers of benchmarks must be continuously updated. To address these challenges, we introduce the PAT-Questions benchmark, which includes single and multi-hop temporal questions. The answers in PAT-Questions can be automatically refreshed by re-running SPARQL queries on a knowledge graph, if available. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs and a SOTA temporal reasoning model (TEMPREASON-T5) on PAT-Questions through direct prompting and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The results highlight the limitations of existing solutions in PATQA and motivate the need for new methods to improve PATQA reasoning capabilities.",
    "Patent Response System Optimised for Faithfulness: Procedural Knowledge Embodiment with Knowledge Graph and Retrieval Augmented Generation": "A successful response to Office Action is crucial for an invention to obtain a patent. While previous attempts have applied generalised LLMs, such as GPT-4, in the response process, there remains significant room for improvement in generating faithful, unbiased, and practically valuable responses. To address this issue, we propose the Patent Response System Optimised for Faithfulness (PRO). PRO explicitly incorporates procedural knowledge used by patent agents during drafting arguments in response. This framework comprises several key components: (1) Our proposed PRLLM is a LLM tailored for patent responses, designed to have comprehensive patent domain-specific knowledge. (2) Our proposed PPNet encodes legal interpretations and relationships between technical components from judicial sources through a knowledge graph. (3) The augmented generation processes retrieve relevant information from both the patent text and PPNet to augment the PRLLM's input and generate faithful responses. Results show that PRO significantly reduces unfaithfulness across six error types compared to several settings. For instance, PRO outperforms GPT-4 by an average of 39% in terms of faithfulness. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our domain-specific approach in improving the quality of automated patent responses.",
    "Pause-Aware Automatic Dubbing using LLM and Voice Cloning": "Automatic dubbing aims to translate the speech of a video into another language, ensuring the new speech naturally fits the original video. This paper details Huawei Translation Services Center's (HW-TSC) submission for IWSLT 2024's automatic dubbing task, under an unconstrained setting. Our system's machine translation (MT) component utilizes a Transformer-based MT model and an LLM-based post-editor to produce translations of varying lengths. The text-to-speech (TTS) component employs a VITS-based TTS model and a voice cloning module to emulate the original speaker's vocal timbre. For enhanced dubbing synchrony, we introduce a parsing-informed pause selector. Finally, we rerank multiple results based on lip-sync error distance (LSE-D) and character error rate (CER). Our system achieves LSE-D of 10.75 and 12.19 on subset1 and subset2 of DE-EN test sets respectively, superior to last year's best system.",
    "Paying More Attention to Source Context: Mitigating Unfaithful Translations from Large Language Model": "Large language models (LLMs) have showcased impressive multilingual machine translation ability. However, unlike encoder-decoder style models, decoder-only LLMs lack an explicit alignment between source and target contexts. Analyzing contribution scores during generation processes revealed that LLMs can be biased towards previously generated tokens over corresponding source tokens, leading to unfaithful translations. To address this issue, we propose to encourage LLMs to pay more attention to the source context from both source and target perspectives in zeroshot prompting: 1) adjust source context attention weights; 2) suppress irrelevant target prefix influence; Additionally, we propose 3) avoiding over-reliance on the target prefix in instruction tuning. Experimental results from both human-collected unfaithfulness test sets focusing on LLM-generated unfaithful translations and general test sets, verify our methods' effectiveness across multiple language pairs. Further human evaluation shows our method's efficacy in reducing hallucinatory translations and facilitating faithful translation generation.",
    "PCA-Bench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models in Perception-Cognition-Action Chain": "We present PCA-Bench, a multimodal decision-making benchmark for evaluating the integrated capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Departing from previous benchmarks focusing on simplistic tasks and individual model capability, PCA-Bench introduces three complex scenarios: autonomous driving, domestic robotics, and open-world games. Given task instructions and diverse contexts, the model is required to seamlessly integrate multiple capabilities of Perception, Cognition, and Action in a reasoning chain to make accurate decisions. Moreover, PCA-Bench features error localization capabilities, scrutinizing model inaccuracies in areas such as perception, knowledge, or reasoning. This enhances the reliability of deploying MLLMs. To balance accuracy and efficiency in evaluation, we propose PCA-Eval, an automatic evaluation protocol, and assess 10 prevalent MLLMs. The results reveal significant performance disparities between open-source models and powerful proprietary models like GPT-4 Vision. To address this, we introduce Embodied-Instruction-Evolution (EIE), an automatic framework for synthesizing instruction tuning examples in multimodal embodied environments. EIE generates 7,510 training examples in PCA-Bench and enhances the performance of open-source MLLMs, occasionally surpassing GPT-4 Vision (+3% in decision accuracy), thereby validating the effectiveness of EIE. Our findings suggest that robust MLLMs like GPT4-Vision show promise for decision-making in embodied agents, opening new avenues for MLLM research. All benchmark data and evaluation code are made public.",
    "Peacock: A Family of Arabic Multimodal Large Language Models and Benchmarks": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have proven effective in a wide range of tasks that require complex reasoning and linguistic comprehension. However, due to a lack of high-quality multimodal resources in languages other than English, success of MLLMs remains relatively limited to English-based settings. This poses significant challenges in developing comparable models for other languages, even those with large speaker populations, such as Arabic. To alleviate this challenge, we introduce a comprehensive family of Arabic MLLMs, dubbed Peacock, with strong vision and language capabilities. Through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate the solid performance of our models on various visual reasoning tasks and further show their emerging dialectal potential. Additionally, we introduce Henna, a new benchmark specifically designed for assessing MLLMs on aspects related to Arabic culture, setting the first stone for culturally-aware Arabic MLLMs. The GitHub repository for the Peacock project is available at https://github.com/UBC-NLP/peacock.",
    "PEARL: A Review-Driven Persona-Knowledge Grounded Conversational Recommendation Dataset": "Conversational recommender systems are an emerging area that has garnered increasing interest in the community, especially with the advancements in large language models (LLMs) that enable sophisticated handling of conversational input. Despite the progress, the field still has many aspects left to explore. The currently available public datasets for conversational recommendation lack specific user preferences and explanations for recommendations, hindering high-quality recommendations. To address such challenges, we present a novel conversational recommendation dataset named PEARL, synthesized with persona- and knowledge-augmented LLM simulators. We obtain detailed persona and knowledge from real-world reviews and construct a large-scale dataset with over 57k dialogues. Our experimental results demonstrate that PEARL contains more specific user preferences, shows expertise in the target domain, and provides recommendations more relevant to the dialogue context than those in prior datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of PEARL by showing that our downstream models outperform baselines in both human and automatic evaluations. We release our dataset1 and code.2",
    "Peering into the Mind of Language Models: An Approach for Attribution in Contextual Question Answering": "With the enhancement in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI), contextual question answering has become extremely relevant. Attributing model generations to the input source document is essential to ensure trustworthiness and reliability. We observe that when large language models (LLMs) are used for contextual question answering, the output answer often consists of text copied verbatim from the input prompt which is linked together with glue text generated by the LLM. Motivated by this, we propose that LLMs have an inherent awareness from where the text was copied, likely captured in the hidden states of the LLM. We introduce a novel method for attribution in contextual question answering, leveraging the hidden state representations of LLMs. Our approach bypasses the need for extensive model retraining and retrieval model overhead, offering granular attributions and preserving the quality of generated answers. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method performs on par or better than GPT-4 at identifying verbatim copied segments in LLM generations and in attributing these segments to their source. Importantly, our method shows robust performance across various LLM architectures, highlighting its broad applicability. Additionally, we present VERIFIABILITY-GRANULAR1, an attribution dataset which has token level annotations for LLM generations in the contextual question answering setup.",
    "PEK: A Parameter-Efficient Framework for Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown great dialogue generation capability in different scenarios. However, the huge VRAM consumption when fine-tuning them is one of their drawbacks. PEFT approaches can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters, which enables us to fine-tune larger dialogue generation models. However, the reduction in parameter quantity can diminish a PLM's expressive capacity and affect the PLM's learning from certain specific examples like knowledge-related conversations. Previous works have demonstrated that injecting external knowledge into dialogue generation models can improve the model's performance in knowledge-related conversations. Nonetheless, these methods are designed for the scenario where most parameters of the entire framework are trainable. In this paper, we propose PEK, a parameter-efficient framework for knowledge-enhanced dialogue generation. It enables PLMs to leverage external knowledge documents and knowledge graphs to enhance its generation capabilities with an acceptable number of trainable parameters. Evaluation results on the Wizard of Wikipedia and CMU_DoG datasets show that our approach outperforms baseline methods on multiple evaluation metrics, which validates the effectiveness of our approach.",
    "PEMT: Multi-Task Correlation Guided Mixture-of-Experts Enables Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as an effective method for adapting pre-trained language models to various tasks efficiently. Recently, there has been a growing interest in transferring knowledge from one or multiple tasks to the downstream target task to achieve performance improvements. However, current approaches typically either train adapters on individual tasks or distill shared knowledge from source tasks, failing to fully exploit task-specific knowledge and the correlation between source and target tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose PEMT, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework based on multi-task transfer learning. PEMT extends the mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework to capture the transferable knowledge as a weighted combination of adapters trained on source tasks. These weights are determined by a gated unit, measuring the correlation between the target and each source task using task description prompt vectors. To fully exploit the task-specific knowledge, we also propose the Task Sparsity Loss to improve the sparsity of the gated unit. We conduct experiments on a broad range of tasks over 17 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate our PEMT yields stable improvements over full fine-tuning, and state-of-the-art PEFT and knowledge transferring methods on various tasks. The results highlight the effectiveness of our method which is capable of sufficiently exploiting the knowledge and correlation features across multiple tasks.",
    "Penetrative AI: Making LLMs Comprehend the Physical World": "Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capabilities across a range of tasks. Questions, however, persist about the nature of LLMs and their potential to integrate common-sense human knowledge when performing tasks involving information about the real physical world. This paper delves into these questions by exploring how LLMs can be extended to interact with and reason about the physical world through IoT sensors and actuators, a concept that we term Penetrative AI. The paper explores such an extension at two levels of LLMs' ability to penetrate into the physical world via the processing of sensory signals. Our preliminary findings indicate that LLMs, with ChatGPT being the representative example in our exploration, have considerable and unique proficiency in employing the embedded world knowledge for interpreting IoT sensor data and reasoning over them about tasks in the physical realm. Not only this opens up new applications for LLMs beyond traditional text-based tasks, but also enables new ways of incorporating human knowledge in cyber-physical systems.",
    "Perceptions of Language Technology Failures from South Asian English Speakers": "English NLP systems have empirically worse performance for dialects other than Standard American English (SAmE). However, how these discrepancies impact use of language technology by speakers of non-SAmE global Englishes is not well understood. We focus on reducing this gap for South Asian Englishes (SAsE), a macro-group of regional varieties with cumulatively more speakers than SAmE, by surveying SAsE speakers about their interactions with language technology and compare their responses to a control survey of SAmE speakers. SAsE speakers are more likely to recall failures with language technology and more likely to reference specific issues with written language technology than their SAmE counterparts. Furthermore, SAsE speakers indicate that they modify both their lexicon and syntax to make technology work better, but that lexical issues are perceived as the most salient challenge. We then assess whether these issues are pervasive in more recently developed Large Language Models (LLMs), introducing two benchmarks for broader SAsE Lexical and Indian English Syntactic understanding and evaluating 11 families of LLMs on them.",
    "PerLTQA: A Personal Long-Term Memory Dataset for Memory Classification, Retrieval, and Fusion in Question Answering": "In conversational AI, effectively employing long-term memory improves personalized and consistent response generation. Existing work only concentrated on a single type of long-term memory, such as preferences, dialogue history, or social relationships, overlooking their interaction in real-world contexts. To this end, inspired by the concept of semantic memory and episodic memory from cognitive psychology, we create a new and more comprehensive Chinese dataset, coined as PerLTQA, in which world knowledge, profiles, social relationships, events, and dialogues are considered to leverage the interaction between different types of long-term memory for question answering (QA) in conversation. Further, based on PerLTQA, we propose a novel framework for memory integration in QA, consisting of three subtasks: Memory Classification, Memory Retrieval, and Memory Fusion, which provides a comprehensive paradigm for memory modeling, enabling consistent and personalized memory utilization. This essentially allows the exploitation of more accurate memory information for better responses in QA. We evaluate this framework using five LLMs and three retrievers. Experimental results demonstrate the importance of personal long-term memory in the QA task.",
    "Perspective Taking through Generating Responses to Conflict Situations": "Although language model performance across diverse tasks continues to improve, these models still struggle to understand and explain the beliefs of other people. This skill requires perspective-taking, the process of conceptualizing the point of view of another person. Perspective taking becomes challenging when the text reflects more personal and potentially more controversial beliefs. We explore this task through natural language generation of responses to conflict situations. We evaluate novel modifications to recent architectures for conditioning generation on an individual's comments and self-disclosure statements. Our work extends the Social-Chem-101 corpus, using 95k judgements written by 6k authors from English Reddit data, for each of whom we obtained 20-500 self-disclosure statements. Our evaluation methodology borrows ideas from both personalized generation and theory of mind literature. Our proposed perspective-taking models outperform recent work, especially the twin encoder model conditioned on self-disclosures with high similarity to the conflict situation.",
    "Persuading across Diverse Domains: A Dataset and Persuasion Large Language Model": "Persuasive dialogue requires multi-turn following and planning abilities to achieve the goal of persuading users, which is still challenging even for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Previous works focus on retrieval-based models or generative models in a specific domain due to a lack of data across multiple domains. In this paper, we leverage GPT-4 to create the first multi-domain persuasive dialogue dataset DailyPersuasion. Then we propose a general method named PersuGPT to learn a persuasion model based on LLMs through intent-to-strategy reasoning, which summarizes the intent of user's utterance and reasons next strategy to respond. Moreover, we design a simulation-based preference optimization, which utilizes a learned user model and our model to simulate next turns and estimate their rewards more accurately. Experimental results on two datasets indicate that our proposed method outperforms all baselines in terms of automatic evaluation metric Win-Rate and human evaluation. The code and data are available at https://persugpt.github.io.",
    "Perturbed examples reveal invariances shared by language models": "The rapid growth in natural language processing (NLP) research has led to numerous new models, outpacing our understanding of how they compare to established ones. One major reason for this difficulty is saturating benchmarks, which may not well reflect differences in model performance in the wild. In this work, we introduce a novel framework to compare two NLP models by revealing their shared invariance to interpretable input perturbations targeting a specific linguistic capability. Via experiments on models from the same and different architecture families, this framework offers insights about how changes in models (e.g., distillation, size increase) affect linguistic capabilities. Furthermore, our framework enables evaluation of invariances between commercial black-box models (e.g., InstructGPT family) and models that are better understood (e.g., GPT-2). Across experiments, we observe that large language models share many invariances encoded by models of various sizes, whereas the invariances by large models are only shared by other large models. Possessing a wide variety of invariances may be key to the recent successes of large language models, and our framework can shed light on the types of invariances retained or emerging in new models. We make the code publicly available.",
    "Phased Instruction Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models": "Instruction Fine-Tuning enhances pre-trained language models from basic next-word prediction to complex instruction-following. However, existing One-off Instruction Fine-Tuning (One-off IFT) method, applied on a diverse instruction, may not effectively boost models' adherence to instructions due to the simultaneous handling of varying instruction complexities. To improve this, Phased Instruction Fine-Tuning (Phased IFT) is proposed, based on the idea that learning to follow instructions is a gradual process. It assesses instruction difficulty using GPT-4, divides the instruction data into subsets of increasing difficulty, and uptrains the model sequentially on these subsets. Experiments with Llama-2 7B/13B/70B, Llama3 8/70B and Mistral-7B models using Alpaca data show that Phased IFT significantly outperforms One-off IFT, supporting the progressive alignment hypothesis and providing a simple and efficient way to enhance large language models. Codes and datasets from our experiments are freely available at https://github.com/xubuvd/PhasedSFT.",
    "PhonologyBench: Evaluating Phonological Skills of Large Language Models": "Phonology, the study of speech's structure and pronunciation rules, is a critical yet often overlooked component in Large Language Model (LLM) research. LLMs are widely used in various downstream applications that leverage phonology such as educational tools and poetry generation. Moreover, LLMs can potentially learn imperfect associations between orthographic and phonological forms from the training data. Thus, it is imperative to benchmark the phonological skills of LLMs. To this end, we present PhonologyBench, a novel benchmark consisting of three diagnostic tasks designed to explicitly test the phonological skills of LLMs in English: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, syllable counting, and rhyme word generation. Despite having no access to speech data, LLMs showcased notable performance on the PhonologyBench tasks. However, we observe a significant gap of 17% and 45% on Rhyme Word Generation and Syllable counting, respectively, when compared to humans. Our findings underscore the importance of studying LLM performance on phonological tasks that inadvertently impact real-world applications. Furthermore, we encourage researchers to choose LLMs that perform well on the phonological task that is closely related to the downstream application since we find that no single model consistently outperforms the others on all the tasks.",
    "Picturing Ambiguity: A Visual Twist on the Winograd Schema Challenge": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in tasks like the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), showcasing advanced textual common-sense reasoning. However, applying this reasoning to multimodal domains, where understanding text and images together is essential, remains a substantial challenge. To address this, we introduce WINOVIS, a novel dataset specifically designed to probe text-to-image models on pronoun disambiguation within multimodal contexts. Utilizing GPT-4 for prompt generation and Diffusion Attentive Attribution Maps (DAAM) for heatmap analysis, we propose a novel evaluation framework that isolates the models' ability in pronoun disambiguation from other visual processing challenges. Evaluation of successive model versions reveals that, despite incremental advancements, Stable Diffusion 2.0 achieves a precision of 56.7% on WINOVIS, showing minimal improvement from past iterations and only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further error analysis identifies important areas for future research aimed at advancing text-to-image models in their ability to interpret and interact with the complex visual world.",
    "PII-Compass: Guiding LLM training data extraction prompts towards the target PII via grounding": "The latest and most impactful advances in large models stem from their increased size. Unfortunately, this translates into an improved memorization capacity, raising data privacy concerns. Specifically, it has been shown that models can output personal identifiable information (PII) contained in their training data. However, reported PII extraction performance varies widely, and there is no consensus on the optimal methodology to evaluate this risk, resulting in underestimating realistic adversaries. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that it is possible to improve the extractability of PII by over ten-fold by grounding the prefix of the manually constructed extraction prompt with in-domain data. Our approach, PII-Compass, achieves phone number extraction rates of 0.92%, 3.9%, and 6.86% with 1, 128, and 2308 queries, respectively, i.e., the phone number of 1 person in 15 is extractable.",
    "Pinpointing Diffusion Grid Noise to Enhance Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction": "Aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) has garnered significant attention in aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Current ASQP research primarily relies on pre-trained generative language models to produce templated sequences, often complemented by grid-based auxiliary methods. Despite these efforts, the persistent challenge of generation instability remains unresolved and the effectiveness of grid methods remains underexplored in current studies. To this end, we introduce Grid Noise Diffusion Pinpoint Network (GDP), a T5-based generative model aiming to tackle the issue of generation instability. The model consists of three novel modules, including Diffusion Vague Learning (DVL) to facilitate effective model learning and enhance overall robustness; Consistency Likelihood Learning (CLL) to discern the characteristics and commonalities of sentiment elements and thus reduce the impact of distributed noise; and GDP-FOR, a novel generation template, to enable models to generate outputs in a more natural way. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our approach in addressing ASQP tasks.",
    "PIXAR: Auto-Regressive Language Modeling in Pixel Space": "Recent work showed the possibility of building open-vocabulary large language models (LLMs) that directly operate on pixel representations. These models are implemented as autoencoders that reconstruct masked patches of rendered text. However, these pixel-based LLMs are limited to discriminative tasks (e.g., classification) and, similar to BERT, cannot be used to generate text. Therefore, they cannot be used for generative tasks such as free-form question answering. In this work, we introduce PIXAR, the first pixel-based autoregressive LLM that performs text generation. Consisting of only a decoder, PIXAR can perform free-form generative tasks while keeping the number of parameters on par with previous encoder-decoder models. Furthermore, we highlight the challenges of generating text as non-noisy images and show this is due to using a maximum likelihood objective. To overcome this problem, we propose an adversarial pretraining stage that improves the readability and accuracy of PIXAR by 8.1 on LAMBADA and 8.5 on bAbI— making it comparable to GPT-2 on text generation tasks. This paves the way to build open-vocabulary LLMs that operate on perceptual input only and calls into question the necessity of the usual symbolic input representation, i.e., text as (sub)tokens.",
    "PLaD: Preference-based Large Language Model Distillation with Pseudo-Preference Pairs": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in various tasks, yet their vast parameter sizes restrict their applicability in resource-constrained settings. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a viable solution by transferring expertise from large teacher models to compact student models. However, traditional KD techniques face specific challenges when applied to LLMs, including restricted access to LLM outputs, significant teacher-student capacity gaps, and the inherited mis-calibration issue. In this work, we present PLaD, a novel preference-based LLM distillation framework. PLaD exploits the teacher-student capacity discrepancy to generate pseudo-preference pairs where teacher outputs are preferred over student outputs. Then, PLaD leverages a ranking loss to re-calibrate student's estimation of sequence likelihood, which steers the student's focus towards understanding the relative quality of outputs instead of simply imitating the teacher. PLaD bypasses the need for access to teacher LLM's internal states, tackles the student's expressivity limitations, and mitigates the student mis-calibration issue. Through extensive experiments on two sequence generation tasks and with various LLMs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our PLaD framework.",
    "Plan, Generate and Complicate: Improving Low-resource Dialogue State Tracking via Easy-to-Difficult Zero-shot Data Augmentation": "Data augmentation methods have been a promising direction to improve the performance of small models for low-resource dialogue state tracking. However, traditional methods rely on pre-defined user goals and neglect the importance of data complexity in this task. In this paper, we propose EDZ-DA, an Easy-to-Difficult Zero-shot Data Augmentation framework for low-resource dialogue state tracking that utilizes large language models to automatically catch the relationships of different domains and then generate the dialogue data. We also complicate the dialogues based on the domain relation to enhance the model's capability for co-reference slot tracking. Furthermore, we permute slot values to mitigate the influence of output orders and the problem of incomplete value generation. Experimental results illustrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to previous strong data augmentation baselines on MultiWOZ.",
    "Planning First, Question Second: An LLM-Guided Method for Controllable Question Generation": "In the field of education, for better assessment of students' abilities, generated questions often need to meet experts' requirements, indicating the need for controllable question generation (CQG). However, current CQG methods mainly focus on difficulty control, neglecting the control of question content and assessed abilities, which are also crucial in educational QG. In this paper, we propose an LLM-guided method PFQS (for Planning First, Question Second), which utilizes Llama 2 to generate an answer plan and then generates questions based on it. The plan not only includes candidate answers but also integrates LLM's understanding and multiple requirements, which make question generation simple and controllable. We evaluate our approach on the FairytaleQA dataset, a well-structured QA dataset derived from child-friendly storybooks. In the dataset, the attribute label represents content control, while the local_or_sum and ex_or_im labels denote difficulty control. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art results and achieves better consistency with requirements compared to prompt-based method. Further application of our method to Llama 2 and Mistral also leads to improved requirement consistency in a zero-shot setting.",
    "Planning Like Human: A Dual-process Framework for Dialogue Planning": "In proactive dialogue, the challenge lies not just in generating responses but in steering conversations toward predetermined goals, a task where Large Language Models (LLMs) typically struggle due to their reactive nature. Traditional approaches to enhance dialogue planning in LLMs, ranging from elaborate prompt engineering to the integration of policy networks, either face efficiency issues or deliver suboptimal performance. Inspired by the dual-process theory in psychology, which identifies two distinct modes of thinking—intuitive (fast) and analytical (slow), we propose the Dual-Process Dialogue Planning (DPDP) framework. DPDP embodies this theory through two complementary planning systems: an instinctive policy model for familiar contexts and a deliberative Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) mechanism for complex, novel scenarios. This dual strategy is further coupled with a novel two-stage training regimen: offline Reinforcement Learning for robust initial policy model formation followed by MCTS-enhanced on-the-fly learning, which ensures a dynamic balance between efficiency and strategic depth. Our empirical evaluations across diverse dialogue tasks affirm DPDP's superiority in achieving both high-quality dialogues and operational efficiency, outpacing existing methods.",
    "Planning, Creation, Usage: Benchmarking LLMs for Comprehensive Tool Utilization in Real-World Complex Scenarios": "The recent trend of using Large Language Models (LLMs) as tool agents in real-world applications underscores the necessity for comprehensive evaluations of their capabilities, particularly in complex scenarios involving planning, creating, and using tools. However, existing benchmarks typically focus on simple synthesized queries that do not reflect real-world complexity, thereby offering limited perspectives in evaluating tool utilization. To address this issue, we present UltraTool, a novel benchmark designed to improve and evaluate LLMs' ability in tool utilization within real-world scenarios. UltraTool focuses on the entire process of using tools - from planning and creating to applying them in complex tasks. It emphasizes real-world complexities, demanding accurate, multi-step planning for effective problem-solving. A key feature of UltraTool is its independent evaluation of planning with natural language, which happens before tool usage and simplifies the task solving by mapping out the intermediate steps. Thus, unlike previous work, it eliminates the restriction of pre-defined toolset. Through extensive experiments on various LLMs, we offer novel insights into the evaluation of capabilities of LLMs in tool utilization, thereby contributing a fresh perspective to this rapidly evolving field.",
    "PlatoLM: Teaching LLMs in Multi-Round Dialogue via a User Simulator": "The unparalleled performance of closed-sourced ChatGPT has sparked efforts towards its democratization, with notable strides made by leveraging real user and ChatGPT dialogues, as evidenced by Vicuna. However, due to challenges in gathering dialogues involving human participation, current endeavors like Baize and UltraChat rely on ChatGPT conducting role-play to simulate humans based on instructions, resulting in overdependence on seeds, diminished human-likeness, limited topic diversity, and an absence of genuine multi-round conversational dynamics. To address the above issues, we propose a paradigm to simulate human behavior better and explore the benefits of incorporating more human-like questions in multi-turn conversations. Specifically, we directly target human questions extracted from genuine human-machine conversations as a learning goal and provide a novel user simulator called 'Socratic'. The experimental results show our response model, 'PlatoLM', achieves SoTA performance among LLaMA-based 7B models in MT-Bench. Our findings further demonstrate that our method introduces highly human-like questioning patterns and rich topic structures, which can teach the response model better than previous works in multi-round conversations.",
    "Play Guessing Game with LLM: Indirect Jailbreak Attack with Implicit Clues": "With the development of LLMs, the security threats of LLMs are getting more and more attention. Numerous jailbreak attacks have been proposed to assess the security defense of LLMs. Current jailbreak attacks primarily utilize scenario camouflage techniques. However, their explicit mention of malicious intent will be easily recognized and defended by LLMs. In this paper, we propose an indirect jailbreak attack approach, Puzzler, which can bypass the LLM's defensive strategies and obtain malicious responses by implicitly providing LLMs with some clues about the original malicious query. In addition, inspired by the wisdom of “When unable to attack, defend” from Sun Tzu's Art of War, we adopt a defensive stance to gather clues about the original malicious query through LLMs. The experimental results indicate that the Query Success Rate of the Puzzler is 14.0%-82.7% higher than baselines on the most prominent LLMs. Furthermore, when tested against the state-of-the-art jailbreak detection approaches, Puzzler proves to be more effective at evading detection compared to baselines.",
    "PLUG: Leveraging Pivot Language in Cross-Lingual Instruction Tuning": "Instruction tuning has remarkably advanced large language models (LLMs) in understanding and responding to diverse human instructions. Despite the success in high-resource languages, its application in lower-resource ones faces challenges due to the imbalanced foundational abilities of LLMs across different languages, stemming from the uneven language distribution in their pre-training data. To tackle this issue, we propose pivot language guided generation (PLUG), an approach that utilizes a high-resource language, primarily English, as the pivot to enhance instruction tuning in lower-resource languages. It trains the model to first process instructions in the pivot language, and then produce responses in the target language. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark, X-AlpacaEval, of instructions in 4 languages (Chinese, Korean, Italian, and Spanish), each annotated by professional translators. Our approach demonstrates a significant improvement in the instruction-following abilities of LLMs by 29% on average, compared to directly responding in the target language alone. Further experiments validate the versatility of our approach by employing alternative pivot languages beyond English to assist languages where LLMs exhibit lower proficiency.",
    "Plum: Prompt Learning using Metaheuristics": "Since the emergence of large language models, prompt learning has become a popular method for optimizing and customizing these models. Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly general, i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization.",
    "PocketLLM: Enabling On-Device Fine-Tuning for Personalized LLMs": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have indeed showcased their impressive capabilities. On mobile devices, the wealth of valuable, non-public data generated daily holds great promise for locally fine-tuning personalized LLMs, while maintaining privacy through on-device processing. However, the constraints of mobile device resources pose challenges to direct on-device LLM fine-tuning, mainly due to the memory-intensive nature of derivative-based optimization required for saving gradients and optimizer states. To tackle this, we propose employing derivative-free optimization techniques to enable on-device fine-tuning of LLM, even on memory-limited mobile devices. Empirical results demonstrate that the RoBERTa-large model and OPT-1.3B can be fine-tuned locally on the OPPO Reno 6 smartphone using around 4GB and 6.5GB of memory respectively, using derivative-free optimization techniques. This highlights the feasibility of on-device LLM fine-tuning on mobile devices, paving the way for personalized LLMs on resource-constrained devices while safeguarding data privacy.",
    "PokeMQA: Programmable knowledge editing for Multi-hop Question Answering": "Multi-hop question answering (MQA) is one of the challenging tasks to evaluate machine's comprehension and reasoning abilities, where large language models (LLMs) have widely achieved the human-comparable performance. Due to the dynamics of knowledge facts in real world, knowledge editing has been explored to update model with the up-to-date facts while avoiding expensive re-training or fine-tuning. Starting from the edited fact, the updated model needs to provide cascading changes in the chain of MQA. The previous art simply adopts a mix-up prompt to instruct LLMs conducting multiple reasoning tasks sequentially, including question decomposition, answer generation, and conflict checking via comparing with edited facts. However, the coupling of these functionally-diverse reasoning tasks inhibits LLMs' advantages in comprehending and answering questions while disturbing them with the unskilled task of conflict checking. We thus propose a framework, Programmable knowledge editing for Multi-hop Question Answering (PokeMQA), to decouple the jobs. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to decompose knowledge-augmented multi-hop question, while interacting with a detached trainable scope detector to modulate LLMs behavior depending on external conflict signal. The experiments on three LLM backbones and two benchmark datasets validate our superiority in knowledge editing of MQA, outperforming all competitors by a large margin in almost all settings and consistently producing reliable reasoning process. Our code is available at https://github.com/Hengrui-Gu/PokeMQA.",
    "Polarization of Autonomous Generative AI Agents Under Echo Chambers": "Online social networks often create echo chambers where people only hear opinions reinforcing their beliefs. An echo chamber often generates polarization, leading to conflicts between people with radical opinions. The echo chamber has been viewed as a human-specific problem, but this implicit assumption is becoming less reasonable as large language models, such as ChatGPT, acquire social abilities. In response to this situation, we investigated the potential for polarization to occur among a group of autonomous AI agents based on generative language models in an echo chamber environment. We had AI agents discuss specific topics and analyzed how the group's opinions changed as the discussion progressed. As a result, we found that the group of agents based on ChatGPT tended to become polarized in echo chamber environments. The analysis of opinion transitions shows that this result is caused by ChatGPT's high prompt understanding ability to update its opinion by considering its own and surrounding agents' opinions. We conducted additional experiments to investigate under what specific conditions AI agents tended to polarize. As a result, we identified factors that influence polarization, such as the agent's persona.",
    "Political Compass or Spinning Arrow? Towards More Meaningful Evaluations for Values and Opinions in Large Language Models": "Much recent work seeks to evaluate values and opinions in large language models (LLMs) using multiple-choice surveys and questionnaires. Most of this work is motivated by concerns around real-world LLM applications. For example, politically-biased LLMs may subtly influence society when they are used by millions of people. Such real-world concerns, however, stand in stark contrast to the artificiality of current evaluations: real users do not typically ask LLMs survey questions. Motivated by this discrepancy, we challenge the prevailing constrained evaluation paradigm for values and opinions in LLMs and explore more realistic unconstrained evaluations. As a case study, we focus on the popular Political Compass Test (PCT). In a systematic review, we find that most prior work using the PCT forces models to comply with the PCT's multiple-choice format. We show that models give substantively different answers when not forced; that answers change depending on how models are forced; and that answers lack paraphrase robustness. Then, we demonstrate that models give different answers yet again in a more realistic open-ended answer setting. We distill these findings into recommendations and open challenges in evaluating values and opinions in LLMs.",
    "PolyuCBS at SMM4H 2024: LLM-based Medical Disorder and Adverse Drug Event Detection with Low-rank Adaptation": "This is the demonstration of systems and results of our team's participation in the Social Media Mining for Health (SMM4H) 2024 Shared Task. Our team participated in two tasks: Task 1 and Task 5. Task 5 requires the detection of tweet sentences that claim children's medical disorders from certain users. Task 1 needs teams to extract and normalize Adverse Drug Event terms in the tweet sentence. The team selected several Pre-trained Language Models and generative Large Language Models to meet the requirements. Strategies to improve the performance include cloze test, prompt engineering, Low Rank Adaptation etc. The test result of our system has an F1 score of 0.935, Precision of 0.954 and Recall of 0.917 in Task 5 and an overall F1 score of 0.08 in Task 1.",
    "POMP: Probability-driven Meta-graph Prompter for LLMs in Low-resource Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation": "Low-resource languages (LRLs) face challenges in supervised neural machine translation (NMT) due to limited parallel data, prompting research in unsupervised NMT (UNMT). UNMT, without requiring ground truth, provides solutions for LRL translations using synthetic pseudo-parallel data and parallel data from auxiliary language pairs. However, they usually encounter translation errors, including errors from synthetic data and from auxiliary language pairs with linguistic biases. We argue that large language models (LLMs) mitigate UNMT's translation errors by dynamically organizing auxiliary languages in prompts to improve LRL translations. In this paper, we propose PrObability-driven Meta-graph Prompter (POMP), an approach employing a dynamic graph to organize multiple auxiliary languages, to prompt LLMs in LRL translations. POMP proposes a language-specific meta-graph that dynamically samples multiple translation paths to organize auxiliary languages in constructing prompts. Following the path, POMP prompts LLMs to translate with a mixture of auxiliary languages. We achieve the meta-graph's evolution by back-propagating evaluation scores to update probabilities on the graph. Our experimental improvements show POMP's effectiveness on LRLs' translation.",
    "Poor-Supervised Evaluation for SuperLLM via Mutual Consistency": "The guidance from capability evaluations has greatly propelled the progress of human society and the development of Artificial Intelligence. However, as LLMs evolve, it becomes challenging to construct evaluation benchmark with accurate labels for LLMs whose capabilities approach or even surpass those of humans (denoted as SuperLLMs). To credibly conduct evaluation without accurate labels (denoted as poor-supervised evaluation), we first prove that the consistency between the model under evaluation and the reference model, when their prediction distributions are independent and the sample size is infinite, can equivalently assess the true capabilities of the model to be evaluated. However, using either humans or LLMs as the reference model cannot sufficiently meet the conditions, for which we propose the PEEM algorithm. By treating all models under evaluation as reference models, PEEM alternately optimizes model weights and filters reference models based on EM algorithm to maximally alleviate the insufficiency of the conditions. Comprehensive experiments across 3 types of tasks with 16 mainstream LLMs validate the efficiency, universality, and effectiveness of PEEM. More generally, PEEM has advanced the evaluation paradigm evolution from human-centric to human&model-centric, alleviating the limitations of human capabilities for evaluating SuperLLMs.",
    "PPTC Benchmark: Evaluating Large Language Models for PowerPoint Task Completion": "Recent evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) have centered around testing their zero-shot/few-shot capabilities for basic natural language tasks and their ability to translate instructions into tool APIs. However, the evaluation of LLMs utilizing complex tools to finish multi-turn, multi-modal instructions in a complex multi-modal environment has not been investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the PowerPoint Task Completion (PPTC) benchmark to assess LLMs' ability to create and edit PPT files based on user instructions. It contains 279 multi-turn sessions covering diverse topics and hundreds of instructions involving multi-modal operations. We also propose the PPTX-Match Evaluation System that evaluates if LLMs finish the instruction based on the prediction file rather than the label API sequence, thus it supports various LLM-generated API sequences. We measure 3 closed LLMs and 6 open-source LLMs. The results show that GPT-4 outperforms other LLMs with 75.1% accuracy in single-turn dialogue testing but faces challenges in completing entire sessions, achieving just 6% session accuracy. We find three main error causes in our benchmark: error accumulation in the multi-turn session, long PPT template processing, and multi-modality perception. These pose great challenges for future LLM and agent systems.",
    "Pragmatic Inference of Scalar Implicature by LLMs": "This study investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), engage in pragmatic inference of scalar implicature, such as some. Two sets of experiments were conducted using cosine similarity and next sentence/token prediction as experimental methods. The results in experiment 1 showed that, both models interpret some as pragmatic implicature not all in the absence of context, aligning with human language processing. In experiment 2, in which Question Under Discussion (QUD) was presented as a contextual cue, BERT showed consistent performance regardless of types of QUDs, while GPT-2 encountered processing difficulties since a certain type of QUD required pragmatic inference for implicature. The findings revealed that, in terms of theoretical approaches, BERT inherently incorporates pragmatic implicature not all within the term some, adhering to Default model (Levinson, 2000). In contrast, GPT-2 seems to encounter processing difficulties in inferring pragmatic implicature within context, consistent with Context-driven model (Sperber and Wilson, 2002).",
    "Predicting Narratives of Climate Obstruction in Social Media Advertising": "Social media advertising offers a platform for fossil fuel value chain companies and their agents to reinforce their narratives, often emphasizing economic, labor market, and energy security benefits to promote oil and gas policy and products. Whether such narratives can be detected automatically and the extent to which the cost of human annotation can be reduced is our research question. We introduce a task of classifying narratives into seven categories, based on existing definitions and data. Experiments showed that RoBERTa-large outperforms other methods, while GPT-4 Turbo can serve as a viable annotator for the task, thereby reducing human annotation costs. Our findings and insights provide guidance to automate climate-related ad analysis and lead to more scalable ad scrutiny.",
    "Predicting Text Preference Via Structured Comparative Reasoning": "Comparative reasoning plays a crucial role in predicting text preferences; however, large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies in their reasoning, leading to incorrect preference predictions. While approaches like Chain-of-Thought improve accuracy in many settings, they struggle to consistently distinguish the similarities and differences of complex texts. We introduce SC2, a model that prompts LLMs to predict text preferences by generating structured intermediate comparisons. SC2 begins by proposing aspects for comparison, followed by generating textual comparisons under each aspect. We select consistent comparisons with a pairwise comparator that ensures each comparison of a given aspect clearly distinguishes differences between texts, significantly reducing hallucination and improving consistency. Our empirical studies across various NLP tasks, including summarization, retrieval, and automatic rating, demonstrate that SC2's enhanced performance in text preference prediction is significant.",
    "Preemptive Answer “Attacks” on Chain-of-Thought Reasoning": "Large language models (LLMs) showcase impressive reasoning capabilities when coupled with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, the robustness of this approach warrants further investigation. In this paper, we introduce a novel scenario termed preemptive answers, where the LLM obtains an answer before engaging in reasoning. This situation can arise inadvertently or induced by malicious users by prompt injection attacks. Experiments reveal that preemptive answers significantly impair the model's reasoning capability across various CoT methods and a broad spectrum of datasets. To bolster the robustness of reasoning, we propose two measures aimed at mitigating this issue to some extent.",
    "Presence or Absence: Are Unknown Word Usages in Dictionaries?": "There has been a surge of interest in computational modeling of semantic change. The foci of previous works are on detecting and interpreting word senses gained over time; however, it remains unclear whether the gained senses are covered by dictionaries. In this work, we aim to fill this research gap by comparing detected word senses with dictionary sense inventories in order to bridge between the communities of lexical semantic change detection and lexicography. We evaluate our system in the AXOLOTL-24 shared task for Finnish, Russian and German languages (Fedorova et al., 2024b). Our system is fully unsupervised. It leverages a graph-based clustering approach to predict mappings between unknown word usages and dictionary entries for Subtask 1, and generates dictionary-like definitions for those novel word usages through the state-of-the-art Large Language Models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 for Subtask 2. In Subtask 1, our system outperforms the baseline system by a large margin, and it offers interpretability for the mapping results by distinguishing between matched and unmatched (novel) word usages through our graph-based clustering approach. Our system ranks first in Finnish and German, and ranks second in Russian on the Subtask 2 test-phase leaderboard. These results show the potential of our system in managing dictionary entries, particularly for updating dictionaries to include novel sense entries. Our code and data are made publicly available1.",
    "PRewrite: Prompt Rewriting with Reinforcement Learning": "Prompt engineering is critical for the development of LLM-based applications. However, it is usually done manually in a “trial and error” fashion that can be time consuming, ineffective, and sub-optimal. Even for the prompts which seemingly work well, there is always a lingering question: can the prompts be made better with further modifications? To address these problems, we investigate automated prompt engineering in this paper. Specifically, we propose PRewrite, an automated method to rewrite an under-optimized prompt to a more effective prompt. We instantiate the prompt rewriter using an LLM. The rewriter LLM is trained using reinforcement learning to optimize the performance on a given downstream task. We conduct experiments on diverse benchmark datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of PRewrite.",
    "Pride and Prejudice: LLM Amplifies Self-Bias in Self-Refinement": "Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) improve their performance through self-feedback on certain tasks while degrade on others. We discovered that such a contrary is due to LLM's bias in evaluating their own output. In this paper, we formally define LLM's self-bias - the tendency to favor its own generation - using two statistics. We analyze six LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Gemini, LLaMA2, Mixtral and DeepSeek) on translation, constrained text generation, and mathematical reasoning tasks. We find that self-bias is prevalent in all examined LLMs across multiple languages and tasks. Our analysis reveals that while the self-refine pipeline improves the fluency and understandability of model outputs, it further amplifies self-bias. To mitigate such biases, we discover that larger model size and external feedback with accurate assessment can significantly reduce bias in the self-refine pipeline, leading to actual performance improvement in downstream tasks. The code and data are released at https://github.com/xu1998hz/llm_self_bias.",
    "PrivaT5: A Generative Language Model for Privacy Policies": "In the era of digital privacy, users often neglect to read privacy policies due to their complexity. To bridge this gap, NLP models have emerged to assist in understanding privacy policies. While recent generative language models like BART and T5 have shown prowess in text generation and discriminative tasks being framed as generative ones, their application to privacy policy domain tasks remains unexplored. To address that, we introduce PrivaT5, a T5-based model that is further pre-trained on privacy policy text. We evaluate PrivaT5 over a diverse privacy policy related tasks and notice its superior performance over T5, showing the utility of continued domain-specific pre-training. Our results also highlight challenges faced by these generative models in complex structured output label space, especially in sequence tagging tasks, where they fall short compared to lighter encoder-only models.",
    "PrivLM-Bench: A Multi-level Privacy Evaluation Benchmark for Language Models": "The rapid development of language models (LMs) brings unprecedented accessibility and usage for both models and users. On the one hand, powerful LMs achieve state-of-the-art performance over numerous downstream NLP tasks. On the other hand, more and more attention is paid to unrestricted model accesses that may bring malicious privacy risks of data leakage. To address these issues, many recent works propose privacy-preserving language models (PPLMs) with differential privacy (DP). Unfortunately, different DP implementations make it challenging for a fair comparison among existing PPLMs. In this paper, we present PrivLM-Bench, a multi-perspective privacy evaluation benchmark to empirically and intuitively quantify the privacy leakage of LMs. Instead of only reporting DP parameters, PrivLM-Bench sheds light on the neglected inference data privacy during actual usage. PrivLM-Bench first clearly defines multi-faceted privacy objectives. Then, PrivLM-Bench constructs a unified pipeline to perform private fine-tuning. Lastly, PrivLM-Bench performs existing privacy attacks on LMs with pre-defined privacy objectives as the empirical evaluation results. The empirical attack results are used to fairly and intuitively evaluate the privacy leakage of various PPLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets of GLUE for mainstream LMs.",
    "Probing Language Models for Pre-training Data Detection": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown their impressive capabilities, while also raising concerns about the data contamination problems due to privacy issues and leakage of benchmark datasets in the pre-training phase. Therefore, it is vital to detect the contamination by checking whether an LLM has been pre-trained on the target texts. Recent studies focus on the generated texts and compute perplexities, which are superficial features and not reliable. In this study, we propose to utilize the probing technique for pre-training data detection by examining the model's internal activations. Our method is simple yet effective and leads to more trustworthy pre-training data detection. Additionally, we propose ArxivMIA, a new challenging benchmark comprising arxiv abstracts from Computer Science and Mathematics categories. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all the baselines, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both WikiMIA and ArxivMIA, with additional experiments confirming its efficacy.",
    "Probing the Emergence of Cross-lingual Alignment during LLM Training": "Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable levels of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer performance. We speculate that this is predicated on their ability to align languages without explicit supervision from parallel sentences. While representations of translationally equivalent sentences in different languages are known to be similar after convergence, however, it remains unclear how such cross-lingual alignment emerges during pre-training of LLMs. Our study leverages intrinsic probing techniques, which identify which subsets of neurons encode linguistic features, to correlate the degree of cross-lingual neuron overlap with the zero-shot cross-lingual transfer performance for a given model. In particular, we rely on checkpoints of BLOOM, a multilingual autoregressive LLM, across different training steps and model scales. We observe a high correlation between neuron overlap and downstream performance, which supports our hypothesis on the conditions leading to effective cross-lingual transfer. Interestingly, we also detect a degradation of both implicit alignment and multilingual abilities in certain phases of the pre-training process, providing new insights into the multilingual pretraining dynamics.",
    "Probing the Multi-turn Planning Capabilities of LLMs via 20 Question Games": "Large language models (LLMs) are effective at answering questions that are clearly asked. However, when faced with ambiguous queries they can act unpredictably and produce incorrect outputs. This underscores the need for the development of intelligent agents capable of asking clarification questions to resolve ambiguities effectively. This capability requires complex understanding, state tracking, reasoning and planning over multiple conversational turns. However, directly measuring this can be challenging. In this paper, we offer a surrogate problem which assesses an LLMs's capability to deduce an entity unknown to itself, but revealed to a judge, by asking the judge a series of queries. This entity-deducing game can serve as an evaluation framework to probe the conversational reasoning and planning capabilities of language models. We systematically evaluate various LLMs and discover significant differences in their performance on this task. We find that strong LLMs like GPT-4 outperform human players by a large margin. We further employ Behavior Cloning (BC) to examine whether a weaker model is capable of imitating a stronger model and generalizing to data or domains, using only the demonstrations from a stronger model. We finally propose to use Reinforcement Learning to enhance reasoning and planning capacity of Vicuna models through episodes of game playing, which lead to significant performance improvement. We hope that this problem offers insights into how autonomous agents could be trained to behave more intelligently in ambiguous circumstances.",
    "PROC2PDDL: Open-Domain Planning Representations from Texts": "Planning in a text-based environment continues to be a significant challenge for AI systems. Recent approaches have utilized language models to predict planning domain definitions (e.g., PDDL) but have only been evaluated in closed-domain simulated environments. To address this, we present PROC2PDDL, the first dataset containing open-domain procedural texts paired with expert-annotated PDDL representations. Using this dataset, we evaluate the task of predicting domain actions (parameters, preconditions, and effects). We experiment with various large language models (LLMs) and prompting mechanisms, including a novel instruction inspired by the zone of proximal development (ZPD), which reconstructs the task as incremental basic skills. Our results demonstrate that PROC2PDDL is highly challenging for end-to-end LLMs, with GPT-3.5's success rate close to 0% and GPT-4o's 38%. With ZPD instructions, GPT-4o's success rate increases to 45%, outperforming regular chain-of-thought prompting's 34%. Our analysis systematically examines both syntactic and semantic errors, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of language models in generating domain-specific programs.",
    "ProgGen: Generating Named Entity Recognition Datasets Step-by-step with Self-Reflexive Large Language Models": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable adaptability across domains, these models often fall short in structured knowledge extraction tasks such as named entity recognition (NER). This paper explores an innovative, cost-efficient strategy to harness LLMs with modest NER capabilities for producing superior NER datasets. Our approach diverges from the basic class-conditional prompts by instructing LLMs to self-reflect on the specific domain, thereby generating domain-relevant attributes (such as category and emotions for movie reviews), which are utilized for creating attribute-rich training data. Furthermore, we preemptively generate entity terms and then develop NER context data around these entities, effectively bypassing the LLMs' challenges with complex structures. Our experiments across both general and niche domains reveal significant performance enhancements over conventional data generation methods while being more cost-effective than existing alternatives.",
    "Progressive Tuning: Towards Generic Sentiment Abilities for Large Language Models": "Understanding sentiment is arguably an advanced and important capability of AI agents in the physical world. In previous works, many efforts have been devoted to individual sentiment subtasks, without considering interrelated sentiment knowledge among these subtasks. Although some recent works model multiple sentiment subtasks in a unified manner, they merely simply combine these subtasks without deeply exploring the hierarchical relationships among subtasks. In this paper, we introduce GSA-7B, an open-source large language model specific to the sentiment domain. Specifically, we deeply explore the hierarchical relationships between sentiment subtasks, proposing progressive sentiment reasoning benchmark and progressive task instructions. Subsequently, we use Llama2-7B as the backbone model and propose parameter-efficient progressive tuning paradigm which is implemented by constructing chain of LoRA, resulting in the creation of GSA-7B. Experimental results show that GSA-7B as a unified model performs well across all datasets in the progressive sentiment reasoning benchmark. Additionally, under the few-shot setting, GSA-7B also exhibits good generalization ability for sentiment subtasks and datasets that were not encountered during its training phase.",
    "ProLex: A Benchmark for Language Proficiency-oriented Lexical Substitution": "Lexical Substitution discovers appropriate substitutes for a given target word in a context sentence. However, the task fails to consider substitutes that are of equal or higher proficiency than the target, an aspect that could be beneficial for language learners looking to improve their writing. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task — language proficiency-oriented lexical substitution. We also introduce ProLex, a novel benchmark designed to assess systems' ability to generate not only appropriate substitutes but also substitutes that demonstrate better language proficiency. Besides the benchmark, we propose models that can automatically perform the new task. We show that our best model, a Llama2-13B model fine-tuned with task-specific synthetic data, outperforms ChatGPT by an average of 3.2% in F-score and achieves comparable results with GPT-4 on ProLex.",
    "PROLORA: Partial Rotation Empowers More Parameter-Efficient LoRA": "With the rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs), serving numerous low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) concurrently has become increasingly impractical, leading to unaffordable costs and necessitating more parameter-efficient finetuning methods. In this work, we introduce Partially Rotation-enhanced Low-Rank Adaptation (PRoLoRA), an intra-layer sharing mechanism comprising four essential components: broadcast reduction, rotation enhancement, partially-sharing refinement, and rectified initialization strategy. As a superset of LoRA, PRoLoRA retains its advantages, and effectively circumvent the drawbacks of peer parameter-sharing methods with superior model capacity, practical feasibility, and broad applicability. Empirical experiments demonstrate the remarkably higher parameter efficiency of PRoLoRA in both specific parameter budget and performance target scenarios, and its scalability to larger LLMs. Notably, with one time less trainable parameters, PRoLoRA still outperforms LoRA on multiple instruction tuning datasets. Subsequently, an ablation study is conducted to validate the necessity of individual components and highlight the superiority of PRoLoRA over three potential variants. Hopefully, the conspicuously higher parameter efficiency can establish PRoLoRA as a resource-friendly alternative to LoRA.",
    "Prompt Chaining or Stepwise Prompt? Refinement in Text Summarization": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capacity to improve summary quality by mirroring a human-like iterative process of critique and refinement starting from the initial draft. Two strategies are designed to perform this iterative process: Prompt Chaining and Stepwise Prompt. Prompt chaining orchestrates the drafting, critiquing, and refining phases through a series of three discrete prompts, while Stepwise prompt integrates these phases within a single prompt. However, the relative effectiveness of the two methods has not been extensively studied. This paper is dedicated to examining and comparing these two methods in the context of text summarization to ascertain which method stands out as the most effective. Experimental results show that the prompt chaining method can produce a more favorable outcome. This might be because stepwise prompt might produce a simulated refinement process according to our various experiments. Since refinement is adaptable to diverse tasks, our conclusions have the potential to be extrapolated to other applications, thereby offering insights that may contribute to the broader development of LLMs.",
    "Prompt Engineering a Prompt Engineer": "Prompt engineering is a challenging yet crucial task for optimizing the performance of large language models on customized tasks. It requires complex reasoning to examine the model's errors, hypothesize what is missing or misleading in the current prompt, and communicate the task with clarity. While recent works indicate that large language models can be meta-prompted to perform automatic prompt engineering, we argue that their potential is limited due to insufficient guidance for complex reasoning in the meta-prompt. We fill this gap by infusing into the meta-prompt three key components: detailed descriptions, context specification, and a step-by-step reasoning template. The resulting method, named PE2, showcases remarkable versatility across diverse language tasks. It finds prompts that outperform “let's think step by step” by 6.3% on MultiArith and 3.1% on GSM8K, and outperforms competitive baselines on counterfactual tasks by 6.9%. Further, we show that PE2 can make targeted prompt edits, rectify erroneous prompts, and induce multi-step plans for complex tasks.",
    "Prompt Me One More Time: A Two-Step Knowledge Extraction Pipeline with Ontology-Based Verification": "This study explores a method for extending real-world knowledge graphs (specifically, Wikidata) by extracting triplets from texts with the aid of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose a two-step pipeline that includes the initial extraction of entity candidates, followed by their refinement and linkage to the canonical entities and relations of the knowledge graph. Finally, we utilize Wikidata relation constraints to select only verified triplets. We compare our approach to a model that was fine-tuned on a machine-generated dataset and demonstrate that it performs better on natural data. Our results suggest that LLM-based triplet extraction from texts, with subsequent verification, is a viable method for real-world applications.",
    "Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning": "We propose a new method, Adversarial In-Context Learning (adv-ICL), to optimize prompts for in-context learning (ICL). Inspired by adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between a generator and discriminator, with LLMs acting as both. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator then classifies the generator's input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator's loss, a prompt modifier LLM proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that applying adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 13 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, our method is computationally efficient, easily extensible to other LLMs and tasks, and effective in low-resource settings.",
    "Prompt-Based Length Controlled Generation with Multiple Control Types": "Large language models (LLMs) have attracted great attention given their strong performance on a wide range of NLP tasks. In practice, users often expect generated texts to fall within a specific length range, making length controlled generation an important topic, especially for GPT-style models. Existing length control methods mostly focus on a simple control type of “equal to” a target length. Different from them, we propose a prompt-based method to achieve length controlled generation under different control types with high accuracy. In particular, we adopt reinforcement learning (RL) and sample filtering with the reward signal given by rule-based reward models, which enhances the length control ability of models by rewarding outputs that follow certain control instructions. In addition, we introduce a standard prompt extractor to parse arbitrary users' input into standard control instructions. Experiments show that our method significantly improves the accuracy of prompt-based length control on popular summarization datasets like CNNDM and NYT under multiple control types. Moreover, both the standard prompt extractor and RL-tuned model show strong generalization to unseen control prompt templates.",
    "Prompted Aspect Key Point Analysis for Quantitative Review Summarization": "Key Point Analysis (KPA) aims for quantitative summarization that provides key points (KPs) as succinct textual summaries and quantities measuring their prevalence. KPA studies for arguments and reviews have been reported in the literature. A majority of KPA studies for reviews adopt supervised learning to extract short sentences as KPs before matching KPs to review comments for quantification of KP prevalence. Recent abstractive approaches still generate KPs based on sentences, often leading to KPs with overlapping and hallucinated opinions, and inaccurate quantification. In this paper, we propose Prompted Aspect Key Point Analysis (PAKPA) for quantitative review summarization. PAKPA employs aspect sentiment analysis and prompted in-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and quantify KPs grounded in aspects for business entities, which achieves faithful KPs with accurate quantification, and removes the need for large amounts of annotated data for supervised training. Experiments on the popular review dataset Yelp and the aspect-oriented review summarization dataset SPACE show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.",
    "Prompting open-source and commercial language models for grammatical error correction of English learner text": "Thanks to recent advances in generative AI, we are able to prompt large language models (LLMs) to produce texts which are fluent and grammatical. In addition, it has been shown that we can elicit attempts at grammatical error correction (GEC) from LLMs when prompted with ungrammatical input sentences. We evaluate how well LLMs can perform at GEC by measuring their performance on established benchmark datasets. We go beyond previous studies, which only examined GPT∗models on a selection of English GEC datasets, by evaluating seven open-source and three commercial LLMs on four established GEC benchmarks. We investigate model performance and report results against individual error types. Our results indicate that LLMs do not always outperform supervised English GEC models except in specific contexts - namely commercial LLMs on benchmarks annotated with fluency corrections as opposed to minimal edits. We find that several open-source models outperform commercial ones on minimal edit benchmarks, and that in some settings zero-shot prompting is just as competitive as few-shot prompting.",
    "PromptRE: Weakly-Supervised Document-Level Relation Extraction via Prompting-Based Data Programming": "Relation extraction aims to classify the relationships between two entities into pre-defined categories. While previous research has mainly focused on sentence-level relation extraction, recent studies have expanded the scope to document-level relation extraction. Traditional relation extraction methods heavily rely on human-annotated training data, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To mitigate the need for manual annotation, recent weakly-supervised approaches have been developed for sentence-level relation extraction while limited work has been done on document-level relation extraction. Weakly-supervised document-level relation extraction faces significant challenges due to an imbalanced number of no relation instances and the failure of directly probing pretrained large language models for document relation extraction. To address these challenges, we propose PromptRE, a novel weakly-supervised document-level relation extraction method that combines prompting-based techniques with data programming. Furthermore, PromptRE incorporates the label distribution and entity types as prior knowledge to improve the performance. By leveraging the strengths of both prompting and data programming, PromptRE achieves improved performance in relation classification and effectively handles the no relation problem. Experimental results on ReDocRED, a benchmark dataset for document-level relation extraction, demonstrate the superiority of PromptRE over baseline approaches.",
    "Proofread: Fixes All Errors with One Tap": "The impressive capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful approach to reimagine users' typing experience. This paper demonstrates the Proofread feature in Gboard, a virtual keyboard running on mobile phones. Proofread enables seamless sentence-level and paragraph-level corrections with a single tap. We describe the complete system in this paper, from data generation, metrics design to model tuning and deployment. To obtain models with sufficient quality, we implement a careful data synthetic pipeline tailored to online use cases, design multifaceted metrics, employ a two-stage tuning approach to acquire the dedicated LLM for the feature: the Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) for foundational quality, followed by the Reinforcement Learning (RL) tuning approach for targeted refinement. Specifically, we find sequential tuning on Rewrite and proofread tasks yields the best quality in SFT stage, and propose global and direct rewards in the RL tuning stage to seek further improvement. Extensive experiments on a human-labeled golden set showed our tuned PaLM2-XS model achieved 85.56% good ratio. We launched the feature to Pixel 8 devices by serving the model on TPU v5 in Google Cloud, with thousands of daily active users. Serving latency was significantly reduced by quantization, bucket inference, text segmentation, and speculative decoding. Our demo could be seen in Youtube.",
    "Propagation and Pitfalls: Reasoning-based Assessment of Knowledge Editing through Counterfactual Tasks": "Current knowledge editing approaches struggle to effectively propagate updates to interconnected facts. In this work, we delve into the barriers that hinder the appropriate propagation of updated knowledge within these models for accurate reasoning. To support our analysis, we introduce a novel reasoning-based benchmark, ReCoE (Reasoning-based Counterfactual Editing dataset), which covers six common reasoning schemes in the real world. We conduct an extensive analysis of existing knowledge editing techniques, including input-augmentation, finetuning, and locate-and-edit methods. We found that all model editing methods exhibit notably low performance on this dataset, especially within certain reasoning schemes. Our analysis of the chain-of-thought responses from edited models indicates that, while the models effectively update individual facts, they struggle to recall these facts in reasoning tasks. Moreover, locate-and-edit methods severely deteriorate the models' language modeling capabilities, leading to poor perplexity and logical coherence in their outputs.",
    "Protecting Privacy Through Approximating Optimal Parameters for Sequence Unlearning in Language Models": "Although language models (LMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities on various tasks, they are potentially vulnerable to extraction attacks, which represent a significant privacy risk. To mitigate the privacy concerns of LMs, machine unlearning has emerged as an important research area, which is utilized to induce the LM to selectively forget about some of its training data. While completely retraining the model will guarantee successful unlearning and privacy assurance, it is impractical for LMs, as it would be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Prior works efficiently unlearn the target token sequences, but upon subsequent iterations, the LM displays significant degradation in performance. In this work, we propose Privacy Protection via Optimal Parameters (POP), a novel unlearning method that effectively forgets the target token sequences from the pretrained LM by applying optimal gradient updates to the parameters. Inspired by the gradient derivation of complete retraining, we approximate the optimal training objective that successfully unlearns the target sequence while retaining the knowledge from the rest of the training data. Experimental results demonstrate that POP exhibits remarkable retention performance post-unlearning across 9 classification and 4 dialogue benchmarks, outperforming the state-of-the-art by a large margin. Furthermore, we introduce Remnant Memorization Accuracy that quantifies privacy risks based on token likelihood and validate its effectiveness through both qualitative and quantitative analyses.",
    "PROTLLM: An Interleaved Protein-Language LLM with Protein-as-Word Pre-Training": "We propose PROTLLM, a versatile cross-modal large language model (LLM) for both protein-centric and protein-language tasks. PROTLLM features a unique dynamic protein mounting mechanism, enabling it to handle complex inputs where the natural language text is interspersed with an arbitrary number of proteins. Besides, we propose the protein-as-word language modeling approach to train PROTLLM. By developing a specialized protein vocabulary, we equip the model with the capability to predict not just natural language but also proteins from a vast pool of candidates. Additionally, we construct a large-scale interleaved protein-text dataset, named InterPT, for pre-training. This dataset comprehensively encompasses both (1) structured data sources like protein annotations and (2) unstructured data sources like biological research papers, thereby endowing PROTLLM with crucial knowledge for understanding proteins. We evaluate PROTLLM on classic supervised protein-centric tasks and explore its novel protein-language applications. Experimental results demonstrate that PROTLLM not only achieves superior performance against protein-specialized baselines on protein-centric tasks but also induces zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities on protein-language tasks.",
    "Prototypical Reward Network for Data-Efficient RLHF": "The reward model for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). Notably, collecting human feedback for RLHF can be resource-intensive and lead to scalability issues for LLMs and complex tasks. Our proposed framework Proto-RM leverages prototypical networks to enhance reward models under limited human feedback. By enabling stable and reliable structural learning from fewer samples, Proto-RM significantly enhances LLMs' adaptability and accuracy in interpreting human preferences. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that Proto-RM significantly improves the performance of reward models and LLMs in human feedback tasks, achieving comparable and usually better results than traditional methods, while requiring significantly less data in data-limited scenarios. This research offers a promising direction for enhancing the efficiency of reward models and optimizing the fine-tuning of language models under restricted feedback conditions.",
    "ProtT3: Protein-to-Text Generation for Text-based Protein Understanding": "Language Models (LMs) excel in understanding textual descriptions of proteins, as evident in biomedical question-answering tasks. However, their capability falters with raw protein data, such as amino acid sequences, due to a deficit in pretraining on such data. Conversely, Protein Language Models (PLMs) can understand and convert protein data into high-quality representations, but struggle to process texts. To address their limitations, we introduce ProtT3, a framework for Protein-to-Text Generation for Text-based Protein Understanding. ProtT3 empowers an LM to understand protein sequences of amino acids by incorporating a PLM as its protein understanding module, enabling effective protein-to-text generation. This collaboration between PLM and LM is facilitated by a cross-modal projector (i.e., Q-Former) that bridges the modality gap between the PLM's representation space and the LM's input space. Unlike previous studies focusing on protein property prediction and protein-text retrieval, we delve into the largely unexplored field of protein-to-text generation. To facilitate comprehensive benchmarks and promote future research, we establish quantitative evaluations for protein-text modeling tasks, including protein captioning, protein question-answering, and protein-text retrieval. Our experiments show that ProtT3 substantially surpasses current baselines, with ablation studies further highlighting the efficacy of its core components. Our code is available at https://github.com/acharkq/ProtT3.",
    "Proving membership in LLM pretraining data via data watermarks": "Detecting whether copyright holders' works were used in LLM pretraining is poised to be an important problem. This work proposes using data watermarks to enable principled detection with only black-box model access, provided that the rightholder contributed multiple training documents and watermarked them before public release. By applying a randomly sampled data watermark, detection can be framed as hypothesis testing, which provides guarantees on the false detection rate. We study two watermarks: one that inserts random sequences, and another that randomly substitutes characters with Unicode lookalikes. We first show how three aspects of watermark design—watermark length, number of duplications, and interference—affect the power of the hypothesis test. Next, we study how a watermark's detection strength changes under model and dataset scaling: while increasing the dataset size decreases the strength of the watermark, watermarks remain strong if the model size also increases. Finally, we view SHA hashes as natural watermarks and show that we can robustly detect hashes from BLOOM-176B's training data, as long as they occurred at least 90 times. Together, our results point towards a promising future for data watermarks in real world use.",
    "PROXYQA: An Alternative Framework for Evaluating Long-Form Text Generation with Large Language Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded remarkably in understanding long-form contents. However, exploring their capability for generating long-form contents, such as reports and articles, has been relatively unexplored and inadequately assessed by existing benchmarks. The prevalent evaluation methods, which predominantly rely on crowdsourcing, are recognized for their labor-intensive nature and lack of efficiency, whereas automated metrics, such as the ROUGE score, demonstrate discordance with human judgment criteria. In this paper, we propose PROXYQA, an innovative framework dedicated to assessing long-text generation. PROXYQA comprises in-depth human-curated meta-questions spanning various domains, each accompanied by specific proxy-questions with pre-annotated answers. LLMs are tasked to generate extensive content in response to these meta-questions, by engaging an evaluator and incorporating the generated texts as contextual background, PROXYQA assesses the generated content's quality through the evaluator's accuracy in addressing the proxy-questions. We examine multiple LLMs, emphasizing PROXYQA's demanding nature as a high-quality assessment tool. Human evaluation demonstrates that the proxy-question method is notably self-consistent and aligns closely with human evaluative standards. The dataset and leaderboard is available at https://proxy-qa.com.",
    "PRP: Propagating Universal Perturbations to Attack Large Language Model Guard-Rails": "Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to be harmless to humans. Unfortunately, recent work has shown that such models are susceptible to automated jailbreak attacks that induce them to generate harmful content. More recent LLMs often incorporate an additional layer of defense, a Guard Model, which is a second LLM that is designed to check and moderate the output response of the primary LLM. Our key contribution is to show a novel attack strategy, PRP, that is successful against several open-source (e.g., Llama 2) and closed-source (e.g., GPT 3.5) implementations of Guard Models. PRP leverages a two step prefix-based attack that operates by (a) constructing a universal adversarial prefix for the Guard Model, and (b) propagating this prefix to the response. We find that this procedure is effective across multiple threat models, including ones in which the adversary has no access to the Guard Model at all. Our work suggests that further advances are required on defenses and Guard Models before they can be considered effective.",
    "PRP-Graph: Pairwise Ranking Prompting to LLMs with Graph Aggregation for Effective Text Re-ranking": "Pairwise Ranking Prompting (PRP) demonstrates impressive effectiveness in zero-shot document re-ranking tasks with large language models (LLMs). However, in the existing methods, PRP only outputs the same label for the comparison results of different confidence intervals without considering the uncertainty of pairwise comparison, which implies an underutilization of the generation probability information of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose PRP-Graph, a novel pairwise re-ranking approach, based on a refined scoring PRP unit that exploits the output probabilities of target labels to capture the degree of certainty of the comparison results. Specifically, the PRP-Graph consists of two stages, namely ranking graph construction and ranking graph aggregation. Extensive experiments conducted on the BEIR benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing PRP-based methods. Comprehensive analysis reveals that the PRP-Graph displays strong robustness towards the initial ranking order and delivers exceptional re-ranking results with acceptable efficiency.",
    "Pruning Large Language Models to Intra-module Low-rank Architecture with Transitional Activations": "Structured pruning fundamentally reduces computational and memory overheads of large language models (LLMs) and offers a feasible solution for end-side LLM deployment. Structurally pruned models remain dense and high-precision, highly compatible with further tuning and compression. However, as the coarse-grained structured pruning poses large damage to the highly interconnected model, achieving a high compression ratio for scaled-up LLMs remains a challenge.  In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic structured pruning approach coupled with a compact Transformer architecture design. The proposed approach, named TransAct, reduces transitional activations inside multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modules, while preserving the inter-module activations that are sensitive to perturbations. Hence, the LLM is pruned into an intra-module low-rank architecture, significantly reducing weights, KV Cache and attention computation. TransAct is implemented on the LLaMA model and evaluated on downstream benchmarks. Results verify the optimality of our approach at high compression with respect to both efficiency and performance. Further, ablation studies reveal the strength of activation-guided iterative pruning and provide experimental analysis on the redundancy of MHA and MLP modules.",
    "PsychoGAT: A Novel Psychological Measurement Paradigm through Interactive Fiction Games with LLM Agents": "Psychological measurement is essential for mental health, self-understanding, and personal development. Traditional methods, such as self-report scales and psychologist interviews, often face challenges with engagement and accessibility. While game-based and LLM-based tools have been explored to improve user interest and automate assessment, they struggle to balance engagement with generalizability. In this work, we propose PsychoGAT (Psychological Game AgenTs) to achieve a generic gamification of psychological assessment. The main insight is that powerful LLMs can function both as adept psychologists and innovative game designers. By incorporating LLM agents into designated roles and carefully managing their interactions, PsychoGAT can transform any standardized scales into personalized and engaging interactive fiction games. To validate the proposed method, we conduct psychometric evaluations to assess its effectiveness and employ human evaluators to examine the generated content across various psychological constructs, including depression, cognitive distortions, and personality traits. Results demonstrate that PsychoGAT serves as an effective assessment tool, achieving statistically significant excellence in psychometric metrics such as reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Moreover, human evaluations confirm PsychoGAT's enhancements in content coherence, interactivity, interest, immersion, and satisfaction.",
    "PsySafe: A Comprehensive Framework for Psychological-based Attack, Defense, and Evaluation of Multi-agent System Safety": "Multi-agent systems, when enhanced with Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibit profound capabilities in collective intelligence. However, the potential misuse of this intelligence for malicious purposes presents significant risks. To date, comprehensive research on the safety issues associated with multi-agent systems remains limited. In this paper, we explore these concerns through the innovative lens of agent psychology, revealing that the dark psychological states of agents constitute a significant threat to safety. To tackle these concerns, we propose a comprehensive framework (PsySafe) grounded in agent psychology, focusing on three key areas: firstly, identifying how dark personality traits in agents can lead to risky behaviors; secondly, evaluating the safety of multi-agent systems from the psychological and behavioral perspectives, and thirdly, devising effective strategies to mitigate these risks. Our experiments reveal several intriguing phenomena, such as the collective dangerous behaviors among agents, agents' self-reflection when engaging in dangerous behavior, and the correlation between agents' psychological assessments and dangerous behaviors. We anticipate that our framework and observations will provide valuable insights for further research into the safety of multi-agent systems. We make our data and code publicly accessible at https://github.com/AI4Good24/PsySafe.",
    "PUB: A Pragmatics Understanding Benchmark for Assessing LLMs' Pragmatics Capabilities": "LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capability for understanding semantics, but their understanding of pragmatics is not well studied. To this end, we release a Pragmatics Understanding Benchmark (PUB) dataset consisting of fourteen tasks in four pragmatics phenomena, namely, Implicature, Presupposition, Reference, and Deixis. We curate high-quality test sets for each task, consisting of Multiple Choice Question Answers (MCQA). PUB includes a total of 28k data points, 6.1k are newly annotated. We evaluate nine models varying in the number of parameters and type of training. Our study reveals several key observations about the pragmatic capabilities of LLMs: 1. chat-fine-tuning strongly benefits smaller models, 2. large base models are competitive with their chat-fine-tuned counterparts, 3. there is a huge variance in performance across different pragmatics phenomena, and 4. a noticeable performance gap between human capabilities and model capabilities. We hope that PUB will enable comprehensive evaluation of LLM's pragmatic reasoning capabilities.",
    "Publicly Shareable Clinical Large Language Model Built on Synthetic Clinical Notes": "The development of large language models tailored for handling patients' clinical notes is often hindered by the limited accessibility and usability of these notes due to strict privacy regulations. To address these challenges, we first create synthetic large-scale clinical notes using publicly available case reports extracted from biomedical literature. We then use these synthetic notes to train our specialized clinical large language model, Asclepius. While Asclepius is trained on synthetic data, we assess its potential performance in real-world applications by evaluating it using real clinical notes. We benchmark Asclepius against several other large language models, including GPT-3.5-turbo and other open-source alternatives. To further validate our approach using synthetic notes, we also compare Asclepius with its variants trained on real clinical notes. Our findings convincingly demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes can serve as viable substitutes for real ones when constructing high-performing clinical language models. This conclusion is supported by detailed evaluations conducted by both GPT-4 and medical professionals. All resources—including weights, codes, and data—used in the development of Asclepius will be made publicly accessible for future research.",
    "Pushing the Limits of Low-Resource NER Using LLM Artificial Data Generation": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an important task, but to achieve great performance, it is usually necessary to collect a large amount of labeled data, incurring high costs. In this paper, we propose using open-source Large Language Models (LLM) to generate NER data with only a few labeled examples, minimizing the need for extensive human-annotated data. Our proposed method is simple and can perform well using only a few labeled data points. Experimental results on diverse low-resource NER datasets show that our proposed data generation method can significantly improve the baseline. Additionally, our method can be used to augment datasets with class-imbalance problems and consistently improves model performance on macro-F1 metrics.",
    "PUZZLEVQA: Diagnosing Multimodal Reasoning Challenges of Language Models with Abstract Visual Patterns": "Large multimodal models extend the impressive capabilities of large language models by integrating multimodal understanding abilities. However, it is not clear how they can emulate the general intelligence and reasoning ability of humans. As recognizing patterns and abstracting concepts are key to general intelligence, we introduce PUZZLEVQA, a collection of 2000 puzzle instances based on abstract patterns. With this dataset, we evaluate large multimodal models with abstract patterns based on fundamental concepts, including colors, numbers, sizes, and shapes. Through our experiments on state-of-the-art large multimodal models, we find that they are not able to generalize well to simple abstract patterns. Notably, GPT-4V achieves a score of 46.4% on single-concept puzzles, which shows that state-of-the-art models struggle on our dataset. To diagnose the reasoning challenges in large multimodal models, we progressively guide the models with our ground truth reasoning explanations for visual perception, inductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning. Our systematic analysis finds that the main bottlenecks of GPT-4V are weaker visual perception and inductive reasoning abilities. Through this work, we hope to shed light on the limitations of large multimodal models and how they can better emulate human cognitive processes in the future.",
    "PyramidInfer: Pyramid KV Cache Compression for High-throughput LLM Inference": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable comprehension abilities but face challenges in GPU memory usage during inference, hindering their scalability for real-time applications like chatbots. To accelerate inference, we store computed keys and values (KV cache) in the GPU memory. Existing methods study the KV cache compression to reduce memory by pruning the pre-computed KV cache. However, they neglect the inter-layer dependency between layers and huge memory consumption in pre-computation. To explore these deficiencies, we find that the number of crucial keys and values that influence future generations decreases layer by layer and we can extract them by the consistency in attention weights. Based on the findings, we propose PyramidInfer, a method that compresses the KV cache by layer-wise retaining crucial context. PyramidInfer saves significant memory by computing fewer keys and values without sacrificing performance. Experimental results show PyramidInfer improves 2.2x throughput compared to Accelerate with over 54% GPU memory reduction in KV cache. Our code is available in https://github.com/mutonix/pyramidinfer.",
    "QAVSA: Question Answering using Vector Symbolic Algebras": "With the advancement of large pretrained language models (PLMs), many question answering (QA) benchmarks have been developed in order to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of these models. Augmenting PLMs with external knowledge in the form of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) has been a popular method to improve their reasoning capabilities, and a common method to reason over KGs is to use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). As an alternative to GNNs to augment PLMs, we propose a novel graph reasoning module using Vector Symbolic Algebra (VSA) graph representations and a k-layer MLP. We demonstrate that our VSA-based model performs as well as QA-GNN, a model combining a PLM and a GNN-module, on 3 multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) datasets. Our model has a simpler architecture than QA-GNN and also converges 39% faster during training.",
    "Quantifying Contamination in Evaluating Code Generation Capabilities of Language Models": "While large language models have achieved remarkable performance on various code generation benchmarks, there have been growing concerns regarding potential contamination of these benchmarks as they may be leaked into pretraining and finetuning data. While recent work has investigated contamination in natural language generation and understanding tasks, there has been less extensive research into how data contamination impacts the evaluation of code generation, which is critical for understanding the robustness and reliability of LLMs in programming contexts. In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of data contamination of popular code generation benchmarks, and precisely quantify their overlap with pretraining corpus through both surface-level and semantic-level matching. In our experiments, we show that there are substantial overlap between popular code generation benchmarks and open training corpus, and models perform significantly better on the subset of the benchmarks where similar solutions are seen during training. We also conduct extensive analysis on the factors that affects model memorization and generalization, such as model size, problem difficulty, and question length. We release all resulting files from our matching pipeline for future research.",
    "Quantifying Generalizations: Exploring the Divide Between Human and LLMs' Sensitivity to Quantification": "Generics are expressions used to communicate abstractions about categories. While conveying general truths (e.g., Birds fly), generics have the interesting property to admit exceptions (e.g., penguins do not fly). Statements of this type help us organizing our knowledge of the world, and form the basis of how we express it (Hamp-ton, 2012; Leslie, 2014). This study investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) interpret generics, drawing upon psycholinguistic experimental methodologies. Understanding how LLMs interpret generic statements serves not only as a measure of their ability to abstract but also arguably plays a role in their encoding of stereotypes. Given that generics interpretation necessitates a comparison with explicitly quantified sentences, we explored i.) whether LLMs can correctly associate a quantifier with the generic structure, and ii.) whether the presence of a generic sentence as context influences the outcomes of quantifiers. We evaluated LLMs using both Surprisal distributions and prompting techniques. The findings indicate that models do not exhibit a strong sensitivity to quantification. Nevertheless, they seem to encode a meaning linked with the generic structure, which leads them to adjust their answers accordingly when a generalization is provided as context.",
    "Quantifying the Persona Effect in LLM Simulations": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable promise in simulating human language and behavior. This study investigates how integrating persona variables—demographic, social, and behavioral factors—impacts LLMs' ability to simulate diverse perspectives. We find that persona variables account for <10% variance in annotations in existing subjective NLP datasets. Nonetheless, incorporating persona variables via prompting in LLMs provides modest but statistically significant improvements. Persona prompting is most effective in samples where many annotators disagree, but their disagreements are relatively minor. Notably, we find a linear relationship in our setting: the stronger the correlation between persona variables and human annotations, the more accurate the LLM predictions are using persona prompting. In a zero-shot setting, a powerful 70b model with persona prompting captures 81% of the annotation variance achievable by linear regression trained on ground truth annotations. However, for most subjective NLP datasets, where persona variables have limited explanatory power, the benefits of persona prompting are limited.",
    "Quantifying Uncertainty in Answers from any Language Model and Enhancing their Trustworthiness": "We introduce BSDETECTOR, a method for detecting bad and speculative answers from a pre-trained Large Language Model by estimating a numeric confidence score for any output it generated. Our uncertainty quantification technique works for any LLM accessible only via a black-box API, whose training data remains unknown. By expending a bit of extra computation, users of any LLM API can now get the same response as they would ordinarily, as well as a confidence estimate that cautions when not to trust this response. Experiments on both closed and open-form Question-Answer benchmarks reveal that BSDETECTOR more accurately identifies incorrect LLM responses than alternative uncertainty estimation procedures (for both GPT-3 and ChatGPT). By sampling multiple responses from the LLM and considering the one with the highest confidence score, we can additionally obtain more accurate responses from the same LLM, without any extra training steps. In applications involving automated evaluation with LLMs, accounting for our confidence scores leads to more reliable evaluation in both human-in-the-loop and fully-automated settings (across both GPT 3.5 and 4).",
    "Quantized Side Tuning: Fast and Memory-Efficient Tuning of Quantized Large Language Models": "Finetuning large language models (LLMs) has been empirically effective on a variety of downstream tasks. Existing approaches to finetuning an LLM either focus on parameter-efficient finetuning, which only updates a small number of trainable parameters, or attempt to reduce the memory footprint during the training phase of the finetuning. Typically, the memory footprint during finetuning stems from three contributors: model weights, optimizer states, and intermediate activations. However, existing works still require considerable memory, and none can simultaneously mitigate the memory footprint of all three sources. In this paper, we present quantized side tuning (QST), which enables memory-efficient and fast finetuning of LLMs by operating through a dual-stage process. First, QST quantizes an LLM's model weights into 4-bit to reduce the memory footprint of the LLM's original weights. Second, QST introduces a side network separated from the LLM, which utilizes the hidden states of the LLM to make task-specific predictions. Using a separate side network avoids performing back-propagation through the LLM, thus reducing the memory requirement of the intermediate activations. Finally, QST leverages several low-rank adaptors and gradient-free downsample modules to significantly reduce the trainable parameters, so as to save the memory footprint of the optimizer states. Experiments show that QST can reduce the total memory footprint by up to 2.3× and speed up the finetuning process by up to 3× while achieving competent performance compared with the state-of-the-art. When it comes to full finetuning, QST can reduce the total memory footprint up to 7×.",
    "QUB-Cirdan at “Discharge Me!”: Zero shot discharge letter generation by open-source LLM": "The BioNLP ACL'24 Shared Task on Streamlining Discharge Documentation aims to reduce the administrative burden on clinicians by automating the creation of critical sections of patient discharge letters. This paper presents our approach using the Llama3 8B quantized model to generate the “Brief Hospital Course” and “Discharge Instructions” sections. We employ a zero-shot method combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce concise, contextually accurate summaries. Our contributions include the development of a curated template-based approach to ensure reliability and consistency, as well as the integration of RAG for word count prediction. We also describe several unsuccessful experiments to provide insights into our pathway for the competition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving high scores across multiple evaluation metrics.",
    "QueryAgent: A Reliable and Efficient Reasoning Framework with Environmental Feedback-based Self-Correction": "Employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic parsing has achieved remarkable success. However, we find existing methods fall short in terms of reliability and efficiency when hallucinations are encountered. In this paper, we address these challenges with a framework called QueryAgent, which solves a question step-by-step and performs step-wise self-correction. We introduce an environmental feedback-based self-correction method called ERASER. Unlike traditional approaches, ERASER leverages rich environmental feedback in the intermediate steps to perform selective and differentiated self-correction only when necessary. Experimental results demonstrate that QueryAgent notably outperforms all previous few-shot methods using only one example on GrailQA and GraphQ by 5.7 and 15.0 F1. Moreover, our approach exhibits superiority in terms of efficiency, including runtime, query overhead, and API invocation costs. By leveraging ERASER, we further improve another baseline (i.e., AgentBench) by up to 10.5 points, revealing the strong transferability of our approach.",
    "Question Translation Training for Better Multilingual Reasoning": "Large language models show compelling performance on reasoning tasks but they tend to perform much worse in languages other than English. This is unsurprising given that their training data largely consists of English text and instructions. A typical solution is to translate instruction data into all languages of interest, and then train on the resulting multilingual data, which is called translate-training. This approach not only incurs high cost, but also results in poorly translated data due to the non-standard formatting of mathematical chain-of-thought. In this paper, we explore the benefits of question alignment, where we train the model to translate reasoning questions into English by finetuning on X-English parallel question data. In this way we perform targeted, in-domain language alignment which makes best use of English instruction data to unlock the LLMs' multilingual reasoning abilities. Experimental results on LLaMA2-13B show that question alignment leads to consistent improvements over the translate-training approach: an average improvement of 11.3% and 16.1% accuracy across ten languages on the MGSM and MSVAMP multilingual reasoning benchmarks.",
    "Question-Analysis Prompting Improves LLM Performance in Reasoning Tasks": "Although LLMs have the potential to transform many fields, they still underperform humans in reasoning tasks. Existing methods induce the model to produce step-by-step calculations, but this research explores the question: Does making the LLM analyze the question improve its performance? We propose a novel prompting strategy called Question Analysis Prompting (QAP), in which the model is prompted to explain the question in n words before solving. The value of n influences the length of response generated by the model. QAP is evaluated on GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 Turbo on arithmetic datasets GSM8K, AQuA, and SAT and commonsense dataset StrategyQA. QAP is compared with other state-of-the-art prompts including chain-of-thought (CoT), Plan and Solve Prompting (PS+) and Take A Deep Breath (TADB). QAP outperforms all state-of-the-art prompts on AQuA and SAT datasets on both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. QAP consistently ranks among the top-2 prompts on 75% of the tests. A key factor of QAP performance can be attributed to response length, where detailed responses are beneficial when answering harder questions, but can negatively affect easy questions.",
    "Question-Instructed Visual Descriptions for Zero-Shot Video Question Answering": "We present Q-ViD, a simple approach for video question answering (video QA), that unlike prior methods, which are based on complex architectures, computationally expensive pipelines or use closed models like GPTs, Q-ViD relies on a single instruction-aware open vision-language model (InstructBLIP) to tackle video QA using frame descriptions. Specifically, we create captioning instruction prompts that rely on the target questions about the videos and leverage InstructBLIP to obtain video frame captions that are useful to the task at hand. Subsequently, we form descriptions of the whole video using the question-dependent frame captions, and feed that information, along with a question-answering prompt, to a large language model (LLM). The LLM is our reasoning module, and performs the final step of multiple-choice QA. Our simple Q-ViD framework achieves competitive or even higher performances than current state of the art models on a diverse range of video QA benchmarks, including NExT-QA, STAR, How2QA, TVQA and IntentQA. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Daromog/Q-ViD",
    "RA-ISF: Learning to Answer and Understand from Retrieval Augmentation via Iterative Self-Feedback": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in numerous tasks but still heavily rely on knowledge stored in their parameters. Moreover, updating this knowledge incurs high training costs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods address this issue by integrating external knowledge. The model can answer questions it couldn't previously by retrieving knowledge relevant to the query. This approach improves performance in certain scenarios for specific tasks. However, if irrelevant texts are retrieved, it may impair model performance. In this paper, we propose Retrieval Augmented Iterative Self-Feedback (RA-ISF), a framework that iteratively decomposes tasks and processes them in three submodules to enhance the model's problem-solving capabilities. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing benchmarks, performing well on models like GPT3.5, Llama2, significantly enhancing factual reasoning capabilities and reducing hallucinations.",
    "RA-LoRA: Rank-Adaptive Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Accurate 2-bit Quantized Large Language Models": "Deploying large language models (LLMs) with their extensive parameters and high memory demands challenges computational efficiency, particularly in fine-tuning for specific applications with limited resources. Techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) help by training a smaller, modifiable extension of the base model to reduce memory usage. However, combining quantization with LoRA, especially in low-bit scenarios, can lead to performance losses due to quantization errors. Our innovative Rank-Adaptive LoRA (RA-LoRA) addresses this by dynamically adjusting the adapter's rank using rank-subspace analysis, optimizing performance with fewer parameters. We tested RA-LoRA on state-of-the-art LLMs for 2-bit efficient fine-tuning, showing it can improve model accuracy with minimal trainable parameters, marking a leap forward in quantization-aware fine-tuning methods and highlighting the significance of rank dynamics in optimizing quantized LLMs.",
    "Raccoon: Prompt Extraction Benchmark of LLM-Integrated Applications": "With the proliferation of LLM-integrated applications such as GPT-s, millions are deployed, offering valuable services through proprietary instruction prompts. These systems, however, are prone to prompt extraction attacks through meticulously designed queries. To help mitigate this problem, we introduce the Raccoon benchmark which comprehensively evaluates a model's susceptibility to prompt extraction attacks. Our novel evaluation method assesses models under both defenseless and defended scenarios, employing a dual approach to evaluate the effectiveness of existing defenses and the resilience of the models. The benchmark encompasses 14 categories of prompt extraction attacks, with additional compounded attacks that closely mimic the strategies of potential attackers, alongside a diverse collection of defense templates. This array is, to our knowledge, the most extensive compilation of prompt theft attacks and defense mechanisms to date. Our findings highlight universal susceptibility to prompt theft in the absence of defenses, with OpenAI models demonstrating notable resilience when protected. This paper aims to establish a more systematic benchmark for assessing LLM robustness against prompt extraction attacks, offering insights into their causes and potential countermeasures.",
    "RaDA: Retrieval-augmented Web Agent Planning with LLMs": "Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit important limitations, such as the restricted context length, dependency on human-engineered exemplars (e.g., for task decomposition), and insufficient generalization. To address these challenges, we propose RaDA, a novel planning method for Web agents that does not require manual exemplars, efficiently leverages the LLMs' context, and enhances generalization. RaDA disentangles planning into two stages: for a new given task, during Retrieval-augmented Task Decomposition (RaD), it decomposes tasks into high-level sub-tasks; next, during Retrieval-augmented Action Generation (RaA), it traverses the trajectory obtained with RaD to iteratively synthesize actions based on dynamically retrieved exemplars. We compare RaDA with strong baselines covering a broad space of design choices, using both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 as backbones; and we find consistent improvements over previous SOTA in two challenging benchmarks, CompWoB and Mind2Web, covering settings with different complexities. We show the contributions of RaDA via ablation studies and qualitative analysis; and we discuss the structural benefits of our more compositional design.",
    "RAGTruth: A Hallucination Corpus for Developing Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Language Models": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a main technique for alleviating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Despite the integration of RAG, LLMs may still present unsupported or contradictory claims to the retrieved contents. In order to develop effective hallucination prevention strategies under RAG, it is important to create benchmark datasets that can measure the extent of hallucination. This paper presents RAGTruth, a corpus tailored for analyzing word-level hallucinations in various domains and tasks within the standard RAG frameworks for LLM applications. RAGTruth comprises nearly 18,000 naturally generated responses from diverse LLMs using RAG. These responses have undergone meticulous manual annotations at both the individual case and word levels, incorporating evaluations of hallucination intensity. We not only benchmark hallucination frequencies across different LLMs, but also critically assess the effectiveness of several existing hallucination detection methodologies. We show that using a high-quality dataset such as RAGTruth, it is possible to finetune a relatively small LLM and achieve a competitive hallucination detection performance when compared to the existing prompt-based approaches using state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4. Furthermore, the fine-tuned model can effectively mitigate hallucination in LLM responses.",
    "Ranking Entities along Conceptual Space Dimensions with LLMs: An Analysis of Fine-Tuning Strategies": "Conceptual spaces represent entities in terms of their primitive semantic features. Such representations are highly valuable but they are notoriously difficult to learn, especially when it comes to modelling perceptual and subjective features. Distilling conceptual spaces from Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a promising strategy, but existing work has been limited to probing pre-trained LLMs using relatively simple zero-shot strategies. We focus in particular on the task of ranking entities according to a given conceptual space dimension. Unfortunately, we cannot directly fine-tune LLMs on this task, because ground truth rankings for conceptual space dimensions are rare. We therefore use more readily available features as training data and analyse whether the ranking capabilities of the resulting models transfer to perceptual and subjective features. We find that this is indeed the case, to some extent, but having at least some perceptual and subjective features in the training data seems essential for achieving the best results.",
    "Ranking Large Language Models without Ground Truth": "Evaluation and ranking of large language models (LLMs) has become an important problem with the proliferation of these models and their impact. Evaluation methods either require human responses which are expensive to acquire or use pairs of LLMs to evaluate each other which can be unreliable. In this paper, we provide a novel perspective where, given a dataset of prompts (viz. questions, instructions, etc.) and a set of LLMs, we rank them without access to any ground truth or reference responses. Inspired by real life where both an expert and a knowledgeable person can identify a novice our main idea is to consider triplets of models, where each one of them evaluates the other two, correctly identifying the worst model in the triplet with high probability. We also analyze our idea and provide sufficient conditions for it to succeed. Applying this idea repeatedly, we propose two methods to rank LLMs. In experiments on different generative tasks (summarization, multiple-choice, and dialog), our methods reliably recover close to true rankings without reference data. This points to a viable low-resource mechanism for practical use.",
    "RankMean: Module-Level Importance Score for Merging Fine-tuned Large Language Models": "Traditionally, developing new language models (LMs) capable of addressing multiple tasks involves fine-tuning pre-trained LMs using a wide collection of datasets, a process that often incurs significant computational expenses. Model merging emerges as a cost-effective alternative, allowing the integration of existing models fine-tuned on different tasks into a single model that performs well across all tasks, eliminating the need for additional training. In this paper, we propose RankMean, an algorithm for merging fine-tuned LMs without requiring any downstream data. RankMean determines merging coefficients based on the relative rankings of weight change magnitudes and applies these coefficients for module-wise integration of various fine-tuned models. Our experimental results demonstrate that RankMean outperforms existing baseline methods on multiple benchmarks.",
    "Rationales for Answers to Simple Math Word Problems Confuse Large Language Models": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated breakthrough mathematical problem-solving capabilities in grade school math word problems (MWP). For example, on the MWP benchmark GSM8K, the accuracy of GPT-3.5-Turbo and MetaMath-70B reaches 80.80% and 82.30%, respectively. One question arises, does it mean that LLMs have truly mastered related mathematical problem-solving abilities? In this paper, by presenting two types of benchmarks, where MCGSM8K aims at selecting one correct solution from four solutions, while GSM8K-Judgement judges whether a solution to a given question is true or false, we demonstrate that the ability of most LLMs to evaluate the mathematical reasoning process of MWP is far from sufficient. To compensate for this issue, we propose hybrid supervised fine-tuning data from the training data of GSM8K, MCGSM8K, and GSM8K-Judgement, which significantly improves performance on the proposed reasoning process evaluation benchmarks. For example, fine-tuning improves the performance of LLaMA-2-13B from 33.51% to 70.89% on MCGSM8K. In conclusion, we experimentally demonstrate that most LLMs have limited ability to evaluate the mathematical reasoning process of MWP, which can be enhanced through fine-tuning.",
    "RAVEL: Evaluating Interpretability Methods on Disentangling Language Model Representations": "Individual neurons participate in the representation of multiple high-level concepts. To what extent can different interpretability methods successfully disentangle these roles? To help address this question, we introduce RAVEL (Resolving Attribute-Value Entanglements in Language Models), a dataset that enables tightly controlled, quantitative comparisons between a variety of existing interpretability methods. We use the resulting conceptual framework to define the new method of Multi-task Distributed Alignment Search (MDAS), which allows us to find distributed representations satisfying multiple causal criteria. With Llama2-7B as the target language model, MDAS achieves state-of-the-art results on RAVEL, demonstrating the importance of going beyond neuron-level analyses to identify features distributed across activations. We release our benchmark at https://github.com/explanare/ravel.",
    "RDRec: Rationale Distillation for LLM-based Recommendation": "Large language model (LLM)-based recommender models that bridge users and items through textual prompts for effective semantic reasoning have gained considerable attention. However, few methods consider the underlying rationales behind interactions, such as user preferences and item attributes, limiting the reasoning capability of LLMs for recommendations. This paper proposes a rationale distillation recommender (RDRec), a compact model designed to learn rationales generated by a larger language model (LM). By leveraging rationales from reviews related to users and items, RDRec remarkably specifies their profiles for recommendations. Experiments show that RDRec achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both top-N and sequential recommendations. Our source code is released at https://github.com/WangXFng/RDRec.",
    "Re-Tuning: Overcoming the Compositionality Limits of Large Language Models with Recursive Tuning": "We present a new method for large language models to solve compositional tasks. Although they have shown strong performance on traditional language understanding tasks, large language models struggle to solve compositional tasks, where the solution depends on solving smaller instances of the same problem. We propose a natural approach to solve compositional tasks recursively. Our method, Re-Tuning, tunes models to break down a problem into subproblems, solve those subproblems, and combine the results. We show that our method significantly improves model performance on three representative compositional tasks: integer addition, dynamic programming, and parity. Compared to state-of-the-art methods that keep intermediate steps towards solving the problems, Re-Tuning achieves significantly higher accuracy and is more GPU memory efficient.",
    "Re3: A Holistic Framework and Dataset for Modeling Collaborative Document Revision": "Collaborative review and revision of textual documents is the core of knowledge work and a promising target for empirical analysis and NLP assistance. Yet, a holistic framework that would allow modeling complex relationships between document revisions, reviews and author responses is lacking. To address this gap, we introduce Re3, a framework for joint analysis of collaborative document revision. We instantiate this framework in the scholarly domain, and present Re3-Sci, a large corpus of aligned scientific paper revisions manually labeled according to their action and intent, and supplemented with the respective peer reviews and human-written edit summaries. We use the new data to provide first empirical insights into collaborative document revision in the academic domain, and to assess the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs at automating edit analysis and facilitating text-based collaboration. We make our annotation environment and protocols, the resulting data and experimental code publicly available.",
    "ReactXT: Understanding Molecular “Reaction-ship” via Reaction-Contextualized Molecule-Text Pretraining": "Molecule-text modeling, which aims to facilitate molecule-relevant tasks with a textual interface and textual knowledge, is an emerging research direction. Beyond single molecules, studying reaction-text modeling holds promise for helping the synthesis of new materials and drugs. However, previous works mostly neglect reaction-text modeling: they primarily focus on modeling individual molecule-text pairs or learning chemical reactions without texts in context. Additionally, one key task of reaction-text modeling - experimental procedure prediction - is less explored due to the absence of an open-source dataset. The task is to predict step-by-step actions of conducting chemical experiments and is crucial to automating chemical synthesis. To resolve the challenges above, we propose a new pretraining method, ReactXT, for reaction-text modeling, and a new dataset, OpenExp, for experimental procedure prediction. Specifically, ReactXT features three types of input contexts to incrementally pretrain LMs. Each of the three input contexts corresponds to a pretraining task to improve the text-based understanding of either reactions or single molecules. ReactXT demonstrates consistent improvements in experimental procedure prediction and molecule captioning and offers competitive results in retrosynthesis.",
    "REAL: A Retrieval-Augmented Entity Linking Approach for Biomedical Concept Recognition": "Large Language Models (LLMs) offer an appealing alternative to training dedicated models for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, outdated knowledge and hallucination issues can be major obstacles in their application in knowledge-intensive biomedical scenarios. In this study, we consider the task of biomedical concept recognition (CR) from unstructured scientific literature and explore the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve accuracy and reliability of the LLM-based biomedical CR. Our approach, named REAL (Retrieval Augmented Entity Linking), combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with curated knowledge bases to automatically annotate natural language texts with concepts from bio-ontologies. By applying REAL to benchmark corpora on phenotype concept recognition, we show its effectiveness in improving LLM-based CR performance. This research highlights the potential of combining LLMs with external knowledge sources to advance biomedical text processing.",
    "Realistic Evaluation of Toxicity in Large Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to our professional workflows and daily lives. Nevertheless, these machine companions of ours have a critical flaw: the huge amount of data which endows them with vast and diverse knowledge, also exposes them to the inevitable toxicity and bias. While most LLMs incorporate defense mechanisms to prevent the generation of harmful content, these safeguards can be easily bypassed with minimal prompt engineering. In this paper, we introduce the new Thoroughly Engineered Toxicity (TET) dataset, comprising manually crafted prompts designed to nullify the protective layers of such models. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate the pivotal role of TET in providing a rigorous benchmark for evaluation of toxicity awareness in several popular LLMs: it highlights the toxicity in the LLMs that might remain hidden when using normal prompts, thus revealing subtler issues in their behavior.",
    "Reasoning in Conversation: Solving Subjective Tasks through Dialogue Simulation for Large Language Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in objective tasks such as open-domain question answering and mathematical reasoning, which can often be solved through recalling learned factual knowledge or chain-of-thought style reasoning. However, we find that the performance of LLMs in subjective tasks is still unsatisfactory, such as metaphor recognition, dark humor detection, etc. Compared to objective tasks, subjective tasks focus more on interpretation or emotional response rather than a universally accepted reasoning pathway. Based on the characteristics of the tasks and the strong dialogue-generation capabilities of LLMs, we propose RiC (Reasoning in Conversation), a method that focuses on solving subjective tasks through dialogue simulation. The motivation of RiC is to mine useful contextual information by simulating dialogues instead of supplying chain-of-thought style rationales, thereby offering potential useful knowledge behind dialogues for giving the final answers. We evaluate both API-based and open-source LLMs including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and OpenChat across twelve tasks. Experimental results show that RiC can yield significant improvement compared with various baselines.",
    "Reasoning in Flux: Enhancing Large Language Models Reasoning through Uncertainty-aware Adaptive Guidance": "Machine reasoning, which involves solving complex problems through step-by-step deduction and analysis, is a crucial indicator of the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, as the complexity of tasks escalates, LLMs often encounter increasing errors in their multi-step reasoning process. This study delves into the underlying factors contributing to these reasoning errors and seeks to leverage uncertainty to refine them. Specifically, we introduce Uncertainty-aware Adaptive Guidance (UAG), a novel approach for guiding LLM reasoning onto an accurate and reliable trajectory. UAG first identifies and evaluates uncertainty signals within each step of the reasoning chain. Upon detecting a significant increase in uncertainty, UAG intervenes by retracting to a previously reliable state and then introduces certified reasoning clues for refinement. By dynamically adjusting the reasoning process, UAG offers a plug-and-play solution for improving LLMs' performance in complex reasoning. Extensive experiments across various reasoning tasks demonstrate that UAG not only enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs but also consistently outperforms several strong baselines with minimal computational overhead. Further analysis reveals that UAG is notably effective in identifying and diminishing reasoning errors.",
    "Reasons to Reject? Aligning Language Models with Judgments": "As humans, we consistently interact with our peers and receive feedback in the form of natural language. This language feedback allows us to maintain appropriate behavior, and rectify potential errors. The question arises naturally: can we use language feedback to align large language models (LLMs)? In contrast to previous research that aligns LLMs with scalar rewards, we present the first systematic exploration of alignment through the lens of language feedback (i.e., judgment). We start with an in-depth investigation of potential methods that can be adapted for aligning LLMs with judgments, revealing that these methods cannot fully capitalize on judgments. To facilitate more effective utilization of judgments, we propose a novel framework, Contrastive Unlikelihood Training (CUT), that allows for fine-grained inappropriate content detection and correction based on judgments. Our results show that, with merely 1317 off-the-shelf judgment data, CUT can beat the 175B DaVinci003 and surpass the best baseline by 50.84 points on AlpacaEval using LLaMA2-13b. CUT can also align LLMs in an iterative fashion using up-to-date model-specific judgments, improving performance from 81.09 to 91.68 points on AlpacaEval using LLaMA2-chat-13b. Further analysis suggests that judgments hold greater potential in LLM alignment than rewards.",
    "Recent Highlights in Multilingual and Multimodal Speech Translation": "Speech translation has witnessed significant progress driven by advancements in modeling techniques and the growing availability of training data. In this paper, we highlight recent advances in two ongoing research directions in ST: scaling the models to 1) many translation directions (multilingual ST) and 2) beyond the text output modality (multimodal ST). We structure this review by examining the sequential stages of a model's development lifecycle: determining training resources, selecting model architecture, training procedures, evaluation metrics, and deployment considerations. We aim to highlight recent developments in each stage, with a particular focus on model architectures (dedicated speech translation models and LLM-based general-purpose model) and training procedures (task-specific vs. task-invariant approaches). Based on the reviewed advancements, we identify and discuss ongoing challenges within the field of speech translation.",
    "RecGPT: Generative Pre-training for Text-based Recommendation": "We present the first domain-adapted and fully-trained large language model, RecGPT-7B, and its instruction-following variant, RecGPT-7B-Instruct, for text-based recommendation. Experimental results on rating prediction and sequential recommendation tasks show that our model, RecGPT-7B-Instruct, outperforms previous strong baselines. We are releasing our RecGPT models as well as their pre-training and fine-tuning datasets to facilitate future research and downstream applications in text-based recommendation. Public “huggingface” links to our RecGPT models and datasets are available at: https://github.com/VinAIResearch/RecGPT.",
    "Recognizing Everything from All Modalities at Once: Grounded Multimodal Universal Information Extraction": "In the field of information extraction (IE), tasks across a wide range of modalities and their combinations have been traditionally studied in isolation, leaving a gap in deeply recognizing and analyzing cross-modal information. To address this, this work for the first time introduces the concept of grounded Multimodal Universal Information Extraction (MUIE), providing a unified task framework to analyze any IE tasks over various modalities, along with their fine-grained groundings. To tackle MUIE, we tailor a multimodal large language model (MLLM), REAMO, capable of extracting and grounding information from all modalities, i.e., 'recognizing everything from all modalities at once'. REAMO is updated via varied tuning strategies, equipping it with powerful capabilities for information recognition and fine-grained multimodal grounding. To address the absence of a suitable benchmark for grounded MUIE, we curate a high-quality, diverse, and challenging test set, which encompasses IE tasks across 9 common modality combinations with the corresponding multimodal groundings. The extensive comparison of REAMO with existing MLLMs integrated into pipeline approaches demonstrates its advantages across all evaluation dimensions, establishing a strong benchmark for the follow-up research. Our resources are publicly released at https://haofei.vip/MUIE.",
    "RECONCILE: Round-Table Conference Improves Reasoning via Consensus among Diverse LLMs": "Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with natural language reasoning tasks. Motivated by the society of minds (Minsky, 1988), we propose RECONCILE, a multi-model multi-agent framework designed as a round table conference among diverse LLM agents. RECONCILE enhances collaborative reasoning between LLM agents via multiple rounds of discussion, learning to convince other agents to improve their answers, and employing a confidence-weighted voting mechanism that leads to a better consensus. In each round, RECONCILE initiates discussion between agents via a 'discussion prompt' that consists of (a) grouped answers and explanations generated by each agent in the previous round, (b) their confidence scores, and (c) demonstrations of answer-rectifying human explanations, used for convincing other agents. Experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that RECONCILE significantly improves LLMs' reasoning - both individually and as a team - surpassing prior single-agent and multi-agent baselines by up to 11.4% and even outperforming GPT-4 on three datasets. RECONCILE also flexibly incorporates different combinations of agents, including API-based, open-source, and domain-specific models, leading to an 8% improvement on MATH. Finally, we analyze the individual components of RECONCILE, demonstrating that the diversity originating from different models is critical to its superior performance.",
    "RECOST: External Knowledge Guided Data-efficient Instruction Tuning": "In the current landscape of large language models (LLMs), the process of instruction tuning serves as an essential step. Considering the high computing power overhead, data-efficient instruction tuning was proposed to reduce the training data size in this process, aiming at selecting high-quality instructional data. Nevertheless, we argue that most current data-efficient instruction-tuning methods are highly dependent on the quality of the original instruction-tuning dataset. When it comes to datasets synthesized by LLMs, a common scenario in this field, dirty samples will even be selected with a higher probability than other samples. To address these challenges, we utilized external knowledge (relevant examples or paragraphs) to evaluate those samples synthesized by LLMs with an in-context-based relative predictive entropy. Based on the new metric, we proposed a framework, dubbed as RECOST, which integrates external-knowledge-base reranking and diversity-consistent sampling into a single pipeline. Through extensive experiments on several synthetic datasets (Alpaca and Alpaca-gpt4), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and achieve even better results with only 1% of the full dataset.",
    "Red Teaming Visual Language Models": "VLMs (Vision-Language Models) extend the capabilities of LLMs (Large Language Models) to accept multimodal inputs. Since it has been verified that LLMs can be induced to generate harmful or inaccurate content through specific test cases (termed as Red Teaming), how VLMs perform in similar scenarios, especially with their combination of textual and visual inputs, remains a question. To explore this problem, we present a novel red teaming dataset RTVLM, which encompasses 12 subtasks (e.g., image misleading, multi-modal jailbreaking, face fairness, etc) under 4 primary aspects (faithfulness, privacy, safety, fairness). Our RTVLM is the first red teaming dataset to benchmark current VLMs in terms of these 4 different aspects. Detailed analysis shows that 10 prominent open-sourced VLMs struggle with the red teaming in different degrees and have up to 31% performance gap with GPT-4V. Additionally, we simply apply red teaming alignment to LLaVA-v1.5 with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) using RTVLM, and this bolsters the models' performance with 10% in RTVLM test set, 13% in MM-hallu, and without noticeable decline in MM-Bench, overpassing other LLaVA-based models in similar size with regular alignment data. This reveals that current open-sourced VLMs still lack red teaming alignment. Our code and datasets will be open-sourced.",
    "Reducing Privacy Risks in Online Self-Disclosures with Language Models": "Self-disclosure, while being common and rewarding in social media interaction, also poses privacy risks. In this paper, we take the initiative to protect the user-side privacy associated with online self-disclosure through detection and abstraction. We develop a taxonomy of 19 self-disclosure categories and curate a large corpus consisting of 4.8K annotated disclosure spans. We then fine-tune a language model for detection, achieving over 65% partial span F1. We further conduct an HCI user study, with 82% of participants viewing the model positively, highlighting its real-world applicability. Motivated by the user feedback, we introduce the task of self-disclosure abstraction, which is rephrasing disclosures into less specific terms while preserving their utility, e.g., “Im 16F” to “I'm a teenage girl”. We explore various fine-tuning strategies, and our best model can generate diverse abstractions that moderately reduce privacy risks while maintaining high utility according to human evaluation. To help users in deciding which disclosures to abstract, we present a task of rating their importance for context understanding. Our fine-tuned model achieves 80% accuracy, on par with GPT-3.5. Given safety and privacy considerations, we will only release our corpus and models to researchers who agree to the ethical guidelines outlined in our Ethics Statement.",
    "REFINESUMM: Self-Refining MLLM for Generating a Multimodal Summarization Dataset": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at synthesizing key information from diverse sources. However, generating accurate and faithful multimodal summaries is challenging, primarily due to the lack of appropriate multimodal datasets for fine-tuning that meaningfully integrate textual and visual modalities. To address this gap, we present a new dataset specifically designed for image-text multimodal summarization, harnessing the capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs. We generate summaries from Wikipedia sections and corresponding images and evaluate them across text-based, visual and multimodal dimensions, employing reference-free metrics. To refine the dataset, we: (1) filter the MLLM-generated summaries by training a critic model on human annotations and using its predictions to remove low-quality summaries; (2) fine-tune the MLLM with the filtered high-quality summaries; (3) use the fine-tuned model in turn to regenerate the summaries. This self-refinement process notably improves summary quality, as measured by human judgments and automatic multimodal metrics, resulting in a valuable dataset for multimodal summarization research.",
    "Reflect-RL: Two-Player Online RL Fine-Tuning for LMs": "As language models (LMs) demonstrate their capabilities in various fields, their application to tasks requiring multi-round interactions has become increasingly popular. These tasks usually have complex dynamics, so supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a limited offline dataset does not yield good performance. However, only a few works attempted to directly train the LMs within interactive decision-making environments. We aim to create an effective approach to fine-tune LMs with online reinforcement learning (RL) in these environments. We propose Reflect-RL, a two-player system to fine-tune an LM using SFT and online RL, where a frozen reflection model (player) assists the policy model (player). To generate data for the warm-up SFT stage, we use negative example generation to enhance the error-correction ability of the reflection model. Furthermore, we designed single-prompt action enumeration and applied curriculum learning to allow the policy model to learn more efficiently. Empirically, we verify that Reflect-RL outperforms SFT and online RL without reflection. Testing results indicate GPT-2 XL 1.56B fine-tuned with Reflect-RL outperforms larger open-source LMs, such as Mistral 7B. The benchmarks, dataset, and code involved in this work are publicly available.",
    "Reformulating Domain Adaptation of Large Language Models as Adapt-Retrieve-Revise: A Case Study on Chinese Legal Domain": "While large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have recently demonstrated astonishing zero-shot capabilities in general domain tasks, they often generate content with hallucinations in specific domains such as Chinese law, hindering their application in these areas. This is typically due to the absence of training data that encompasses such a specific domain, preventing GPT-4 from acquiring in-domain knowledge. A pressing challenge is that it's not plausible to continue training LLMs of the GPT-4's scale on in-domain data.  This paper introduces a simple yet effective domain adaptation framework for GPT-4 by reformulating generation as an adapt-retrieve-revise process. The initial step is to adapt an affordable 7B LLM to the Chinese legal domain by continuing learning in-domain data. When solving an in-domain task, we leverage the adapted LLM to generate a draft answer given a task query. Then, the draft answer will be used to retrieve supporting evidence candidates from an external in-domain knowledge base. Finally, the draft answer and retrieved evidence are concatenated into a whole prompt to let GPT-4 assess the evidence and revise the draft answer to generate the final answer.  Our proposal combines the advantages of the efficiency of adapting a smaller 7B model with the evidence-assessing capability of GPT-4 and effectively prevents GPT-4 from generating hallucinatory content. In the zero-shot setting of four Chinese legal tasks, our method improves the average score by +33.6 points, compared to GPT-4 direct generation. When compared to two stronger retrieval-based baselines, our method outperforms them by +17.0 and +23.5.",
    "REFT: Reasoning with REinforced Fine-Tuning": "One way to enhance the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is to conduct Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations. This approach does not show sufficiently strong generalization ability, however, because the training only relies on the given CoT data. In math problem-solving, for example, there is usually only one annotated reasoning path for each question in the training data. Intuitively, it would be better for the algorithm to learn from multiple annotated reasoning paths given a question. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) to enhance the generalizability of learning LLMs for reasoning, with math problem-solving as an example. ReFT first warmups the model with SFT, and then employs on-line reinforcement learning, specifically the PPO algorithm in this paper, to further fine-tune the model, where an abundance of reasoning paths are automatically sampled given the question and the rewards are naturally derived from the ground-truth answers. Extensive experiments on GSM8K, MathQA, and SVAMP datasets show that ReFT significantly outperforms SFT, and the performance can be potentially further boosted by combining inference-time strategies such as majority voting and re-ranking. Note that ReFT obtains the improvement by learning from the same training questions as SFT, without relying on extra or augmented training questions. This indicates a superior generalization ability for ReFT.",
    "RefuteBench: Evaluating Refuting Instruction-Following for Large Language Models": "The application scope of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly expanding. In practical use, users might provide feedback based on the model's output, hoping for a responsive model that can complete responses according to their feedback. Whether the model can appropriately respond to users' refuting feedback and consistently follow through with execution has not been thoroughly analyzed. In light of this, this paper proposes a comprehensive benchmark, RefuteBench, covering tasks such as question answering, machine translation, and email writing. The evaluation aims to assess whether models can positively accept feedback in the form of refuting instructions and whether they can consistently adhere to user demands throughout the conversation. We conduct evaluations on numerous LLMs and find that LLMs are stubborn, i.e., exhibit an inclination to their internal knowledge, often failing to comply with user feedback. Additionally, as the length of the conversation increases, models gradually forget the user's stated feedback and roll back to their own responses. We further propose a recall-and-repeat prompts as a simple and effective way to enhance the model's responsiveness to feedback.",
    "Reinforcement Learning-Driven LLM Agent for Automated Attacks on LLMs": "Recently, there has been a growing focus on conducting attacks on large language models (LLMs) to assess LLMs' safety. Yet, existing attack methods face challenges, including the need to access model weights or merely ensuring LLMs output harmful information without controlling the specific content of their output. Exactly control of the LLM output can produce more inconspicuous attacks which could reveal a new page for LLM security. To achieve this, we propose RLTA: the Reinforcement Learning Targeted Attack, a framework that is designed for attacking language models (LLMs) and is adaptable to black box (weight inaccessible) scenarios. It is capable of automatically generating malicious prompts that trigger target LLMs to produce specific outputs. We demonstrate RLTA in two different scenarios: LLM trojan detection and jailbreaking. The comprehensive experimental results show the potential of RLTA in enhancing the security measures surrounding contemporary LLMs.",
    "Reinforcement Tuning for Detecting Stances and Debunking Rumors Jointly with Large Language Models": "Learning multi-task models for jointly detecting stance and verifying rumors poses challenges due to the need for training data of stance at post level and rumor veracity at claim level, which are difficult to obtain. To address this issue, we leverage large language models (LLMs) as the foundation annotators for the joint stance detection (SD) and rumor verification (RV) tasks, dubbed as JSDRV. We introduce a novel reinforcement tuning framework to enhance the joint predictive capabilities of LLM-based SD and RV components. Specifically, we devise a policy for selecting LLM-annotated data at the two levels, employing a hybrid reward mechanism to choose high-quality labels for effective LLM fine-tuning on both tasks. Results demonstrate that JSDRV improves the capabilities of LLMs in the joint tasks, not only outperforming state-of-the-art methods but also generalizing to non-LLMs accommodated as task models.",
    "REInstruct: Building Instruction Data from Unlabeled Corpus": "Manually annotating instruction data for large language models is difficult, costly, and hard to scale. Meanwhile, current automatic annotation methods typically rely on distilling synthetic data from proprietary LLMs, which not only limits the upper bound of the quality of the instruction data but also raises potential copyright issues. In this paper, we propose REInstruct, a simple and scalable method to automatically build instruction data from an unlabeled corpus without heavy reliance on proprietary LLMs and human annotation. Specifically, REInstruct first selects a subset of unlabeled texts that potentially contain well-structured helpful and insightful content and then generates instructions for these texts. To generate accurate and relevant responses for effective and robust training, REInstruct further proposes a rewriting-based approach to improve the quality of the generated instruction data. By training Llama-7b on a combination of 3k seed data and 32k synthetic data from REInstruct, fine-tuned model achieves a 65.41% win rate on AlpacaEval leaderboard against text-davinci-003, outperforming other open-source, non-distilled instruction data construction methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/cs32963/REInstruct.",
    "RelayAttention for Efﬁcient Large Language Model Serving with Long System Prompts": "A practical large language model (LLM) service may involve a long system prompt, which specifies the instructions, examples, and knowledge documents of the task and is reused across requests. However, the long system prompt causes throughput/latency bottlenecks as the cost of generating the next token grows w.r.t. the sequence length. This paper aims to improve the efficiency of LLM services that involve long system prompts. Our key observation is that handling these system prompts requires heavily redundant memory accesses in existing causal attention computation algorithms. Specifically, for batched requests, the cached hidden states (i.e., key-value pairs) of system prompts are transferred from off-chip DRAM to on-chip SRAM multiple times, each corresponding to an individual request. To eliminate such a redundancy, we propose RelayAttention, an attention algorithm that allows reading these hidden states from DRAM exactly once for a batch of input tokens. RelayAttention is a free lunch: it maintains the generation quality while requiring no model retraining, as it is based on a mathematical reformulation of causal attention. We have observed significant performance improvements to a production-level system, vLLM, through integration with RelayAttention. The improvements are even more profound with longer system prompts.",
    "Relying on the Unreliable: The Impact of Language Models' Reluctance to Express Uncertainty": "As natural language becomes the default interface for human-AI interaction, there is a need for LMs to appropriately communicate uncertainties in downstream applications. In this work, we investigate how LMs incorporate confidence in responses via natural language and how downstream users behave in response to LM-articulated uncertainties. We examine publicly deployed models and find that LMs are reluctant to express uncertainties when answering questions even when they produce incorrect responses. LMs can be explicitly prompted to express confidences, but tend to be overconfident, resulting in high error rates (an average of 47%) among confident responses. We test the risks of LM overconfidence by conducting human experiments and show that users rely heavily on LM generations, whether or not they are marked by certainty. Lastly, we investigate the preference-annotated datasets used in post training alignment and find that humans are biased against texts with uncertainty. Our work highlights new safety harms facing human-LM interactions and proposes design recommendations and mitigating strategies moving forward.",
    "ReMAG-KR: Retrieval and Medically Assisted Generation with Knowledge Reduction for Medical Question Answering": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant potential for facilitating intelligent end-user applications in healthcare. However, hallucinations remain an inherent problem with LLMs, making it crucial to address this issue with extensive medical knowledge and data. In this work, we propose a Retrieve-and-Medically-Augmented-Generation with Knowledge Reduction (ReMAG-KR) pipeline, employing a carefully curated knowledge base using cross-encoder re-ranking strategies. The pipeline is tested on medical MCQ-based QA datasets as well as general QA datasets. It was observed that when the knowledge base is reduced, the model's performance decreases by 2-8%, while the inference time improves by 47%.",
    "rematchka at ArabicNLU2024: Evaluating Large Language Models for Arabic Word Sense and Location Sense Disambiguation": "Natural Language Understanding (NLU) plays a vital role in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by facilitating semantic interactions. Arabic, with its diverse morphology, poses a challenge as it allows multiple interpretations of words, leading to potential misunderstandings and errors in NLP applications. In this paper, we present our approach for tackling Arabic NLU shared tasks for word sense disambiguation (WSD) and location mention disambiguation (LMD). Various approaches have been investigated from zero-shot inference of large language models (LLMs) to fine-tuning of pre-trained language models (PLMs). The best approach achieved 57% on WSD task ranking third place, while for the LMD task, our best systems achieved 94% MRR@1 ranking first place.",
    "RePair: Automated Program Repair with Process-based Feedback": "The gap between the trepidation of program reliability and the expense of repairs underscores the indispensability of Automated Program Repair (APR). APR is instrumental in transforming vulnerable programs into more robust ones, bolstering program reliability while simultaneously diminishing the financial burden of manual repairs. Commercial-scale language models (LM) have taken APR to unprecedented levels. However, the emergence reveals that for models fewer than 100B parameters, making single-step modifications may be difficult to achieve the desired effect. Moreover, humans interact with the LM through explicit prompts, which hinders the LM from receiving feedback from compiler and test cases to automatically optimize its repair policies. In this literature, we explore how small-scale LM (less than 20B) achieve excellent performance through process supervision and feedback. We start by constructing a dataset named CodeNet4Repair, replete with multiple repair records, which supervises the fine-tuning of a foundational model. Building upon the encouraging outcomes of reinforcement learning, we develop a reward model that serves as a critic, providing feedback for the fine-tuned LM's action, progressively optimizing its policy. During inference, we require the LM to generate solutions iteratively until the repair effect no longer improves or hits the maximum step limit. The results show that process-based not only outperforms larger outcome-based generation methods, but also nearly matches the performance of closed-source commercial large-scale LMs.",
    "RePALM: Popular Quote Tweet Generation via Auto-Response Augmentation": "A quote tweet allows users to share others' content and add their comments. To help users write a quote tweet with better public engagement, we study the popular quote tweet generation task. It aims to generate quote tweets with higher popularity reflected by more likes, replies, and retweets. Despite the exceptional language generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs), limited work has examined how LLMs can learn the popularity of text to engage the public better. Consequently, we propose a novel Response-augmented Popularity-Aligned Language Model (RePALM) to align language generation to popularity by leveraging readers' insights from augmented auto-responses. Here, we employ the Proximal Policy Optimization framework with a dual-reward mechanism to jointly explore the quote tweet's popularity and consistency with the auto-responses. For experiments, we gathered two datasets of quote tweets with external links and others' tweets. Extensive results show the superiority of RePALM over advanced language models without response augmentation.",
    "RepCodec: A Speech Representation Codec for Speech Tokenization": "With recent rapid growth of large language models (LLMs), discrete speech tokenization has played an important role for injecting speech into LLMs. However, this discretization gives rise to a loss of information, consequently impairing overall performance. To improve the performance of these discrete speech tokens, we present RepCodec, a novel speech representation codec for semantic speech tokenization. In contrast to audio codecs which reconstruct the raw audio, RepCodec learns a vector quantization codebook through reconstructing speech representations from speech encoders like HuBERT or data2vec. Together, the speech encoder, the codec encoder and the vector quantization codebook form a pipeline for converting speech waveforms into semantic tokens. The extensive experiments illustrate that RepCodec, by virtue of its enhanced information retention capacity, significantly outperforms the widely used k-means clustering approach in both speech understanding and generation. Furthermore, this superiority extends across various speech encoders and languages, affirming the robustness of RepCodec. We believe our method can facilitate large language modeling research on speech processing.",
    "Rephrasing the Web: A Recipe for Compute and Data-Efficient Language Modeling": "Large language models are trained on massive scrapes of the web, which are often unstructured, noisy, and poorly phrased. Current scaling laws show that learning from such data requires an abundance of both compute and data, which grows with the size of the model being trained. This is infeasible both because of the large compute costs and duration associated with pre-training, and the impending scarcity of high-quality data on the web. In this work, we propose Web Rephrase Augmented Pre-training (WRAP) that uses an off-the-shelf instruction-tuned model prompted to paraphrase documents on the web in specific styles such as “like Wikipedia” or in “question-answer format” to jointly pre-train LLMs on real and synthetic rephrases. First, we show that using WRAP on the C4 dataset, which is naturally noisy, speeds up pre-training by ∼3×. At the same pre-training compute budget, it improves perplexity by more than 50% on average across different subsets of the Pile, and improves zero-shot question answer accuracy across 13 tasks by more than 2%. Second, we investigate the impact of the re-phrasing style on the performance of the model, offering insights into how the composition of the training data can impact the performance of LLMs in OOD settings. Our gains are attributed to the fact that re-phrased synthetic data (i) incorporates style diversity that closely reflects downstream evaluation style, and (ii) has higher 'quality' than web-scraped data.",
    "RESCUE: Ranking LLM Responses with Partial Ordering to Improve Response Generation": "Customizing LLMs for a specific task involves separating high-quality responses from lower-quality ones. This skill can be developed using supervised fine-tuning with extensive human preference data. However, obtaining a large volume of expert-annotated data is costly for most tasks. In this paper, we explore a novel method to optimize LLMs using ranking metrics. This method trains the model to prioritize the best responses from a pool of candidates created for a particular task. Rather than a traditional full ordering, we advocate for a partial ordering, as achieving consensus on the perfect order of candidate responses can be challenging. Our partial ordering is more robust, less sensitive to noise, and can be achieved with limited human annotations or through heuristic methods. We test our system's improved response generation ability using benchmark datasets, including textual entailment and multi-document question answering. We conduct ablation studies to understand crucial factors, such as how to gather candidate responses for a specific task, determine their most suitable order, and balance supervised fine-tuning with ranking metrics. Our approach, named RESCUE, offers a promising avenue for enhancing the response generation and task accuracy of LLMs.",
    "RESEMO: A Benchmark Chinese Dataset for Studying Responsive Emotion from Social Media Content": "On social media platforms, users' emotions are triggered when they encounter particular content from other users, where such emotions are different from those that spontaneously emerged, owing to the “responsive” nature. Analyzing the aforementioned responsive emotions from user interactions is a task of significant importance for understanding human cognition, the mechanisms of emotion generation, behavior on the Internet, etc. Performing the task with artificial intelligence generally requires human-annotated data to help train a well-performing system, while existing data resources do not cover this specific area, with none of them focusing on responsive emotion analysis. In this paper, we propose a Chinese dataset named RESEMO for responsive emotion analysis, including 3,813 posts with 68,781 comments collected from Weibo, the largest social media platform in China. RESEMO contains three types of human annotations with respect to responsive emotions, namely, responsive relationship, responsive emotion cause, and responsive emotion category. Moreover, to test this dataset, we build large language model (LLM) baseline methods for responsive relation extraction, responsive emotion cause extraction, and responsive emotion detection, which show the potential of the proposed RESEMO being a benchmark for future studies on responsive emotions.",
    "ResLoRA: Identity Residual Mapping in Low-Rank Adaption": "As one of the most popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is commonly applied to fine-tune large language models (LLMs). However, updating the weights of LoRA blocks effectively and expeditiously is challenging due to the long calculation path in the original model. To address this, we propose ResLoRA, an improved framework of LoRA. By adding residual paths during training and using merging approaches to eliminate these extra paths during inference, our method can achieve better results in fewer training steps without any extra trainable parameters or inference cost compared to LoRA. The experiments on NLG, NLU, and text-to-image tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. To the best of our knowledge, ResLoRA is the first work that combines the residual path with LoRA. The code of our method is available at https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps/tree/main/reslora.",
    "Resonance RoPE: Improving Context Length Generalization of Large Language Models": "This paper addresses the challenge of train-short-test-long (TSTL) scenarios in Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), where models pre-trained on shorter sequences face difficulty with out-of-distribution (OOD) token positions in longer sequences. We introduce RESONANCE ROPE, a novel approach designed to narrow the generalization gap in TSTL scenarios by refining the interpolation of RoPE features for OOD positions, significantly improving the model performance without additional online computational costs. Furthermore, we present POSGEN, a new synthetic benchmark specifically designed for fine-grained behavior analysis in TSTL scenarios, aiming to isolate the constantly increasing difficulty of token generation on long contexts from the challenges of recognizing new token positions. Our experiments on synthetic tasks show that after applying RESONANCE ROPE, Transformers recognize OOD position better and more robustly. Our extensive LLM experiments also show superior performance after applying RESONANCE ROPE to the current state-of-the-art RoPE scaling method, YaRN, on both upstream language modeling tasks and a variety of downstream long-text applications.",
    "Retaining Key Information under High Compression Ratios: Query-Guided Compressor for LLMs": "The growing popularity of Large Language Models has sparked interest in context compression for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the performance of previous methods degrades dramatically as compression ratios increase, sometimes even falling to the closed-book level. This decline can be attributed to the loss of key information during the compression process. Our preliminary study supports this hypothesis, emphasizing the significance of retaining key information to maintain model performance under high compression ratios. As a result, we introduce Query-Guided Compressor (QGC), which leverages queries to guide the context compression process, effectively preserving key information within the compressed context. Additionally, we employ a dynamic compression strategy. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed QGC on the Question Answering task, including NaturalQuestions, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA datasets. Experimental results show that QGC can consistently perform well even at high compression ratios, which also offers significant benefits in terms of inference cost and throughput.",
    "Rethinking Negative Instances for Generative Named Entity Recognition": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for generalizing in unseen tasks. In the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, recent advancements have seen the remarkable improvement of LLMs in a broad range of entity domains via instruction tuning, by adopting entity-centric schema. In this work, we explore the potential enhancement of the existing methods by incorporating negative instances into training. Our experiments reveal that negative instances contribute to remarkable improvements by (1) introducing contextual information, and (2) clearly delineating label boundaries. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient longest common subsequence (LCS) matching algorithm, which is tailored to transform unstructured predictions into structured entities. By integrating these components, we present GNER, a Generative NER system that shows improved zero-shot performance across unseen entity domains. Our comprehensive evaluation illustrates our system's superiority, surpassing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods by 9 F1 score in zero-shot evaluation.",
    "Rethinking Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems: From Complex Modularity to Zero-Shot Autonomous Agent": "Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are predominantly designed to be composed of several functional modules (e.g. dialogue state tracker, dialogue policy, natural language generation) whether they are pipeline or end-to-end architectures. However, this modular design not only heavily relies on massive fully-annotated data, but also suffers from many intrinsic drawbacks, such as serious error accumulation, poor generalization ability, high customization cost, and low fault tolerance rate. In this paper, we rethink the architecture of the task-oriented dialogue systems and propose a novel fully zero-shot autonomous TOD agent, named AutoTOD, where all the delicate modules in traditional TOD systems are deprecated and all it needs is a general-purpose instruction-following language model (e.g. GPT-4). AutoTOD only leverages a simple instruction schema consisting of the description of tasks and external APIs, and can autonomously decide what to do at each dialogue turn, including asking for information, calling APIs, summarizing API results, and correcting previous mistakes. Moreover, we propose a simulation-based evaluation framework to better validate the abilities of TOD models in real-life scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets show the superior task completion ability and flexible language skills of AutoTOD.",
    "Rethinking the Bounds of LLM Reasoning: Are Multi-Agent Discussions the Key?": "Recent progress in LLMs discussion suggests that multi-agent discussion improves the reasoning abilities of LLMs. In this work, we reevaluate this claim through systematic experiments, where we propose a novel group discussion framework to enrich the set of discussion mechanisms. Interestingly, our results show that a single-agent LLM with strong prompts can achieve almost the same performance as the best existing discussion approach on a wide range of reasoning tasks and backbone LLMs. We observe that the multi-agent discussion performs better than a single agent only when there is no demonstration in the prompt. Further study reveals the common interaction mechanisms of LLMs during the discussion.",
    "Retrieval Augmented Fact Verification by Synthesizing Contrastive Arguments": "The rapid propagation of misinformation poses substantial risks to public interest. To combat misinformation, large language models (LLMs) are adapted to automatically verify claim credibility. Nevertheless, existing methods heavily rely on the embedded knowledge within LLMs and/or black-box APIs for evidence collection, leading to subpar performance with smaller LLMs or upon unreliable context. In this paper, we propose retrieval augmented fact verification through the synthesis of contrasting arguments (RAFTS). Upon input claims, RAFTS starts with evidence retrieval, where we design a retrieval pipeline to collect and re-rank relevant documents from verifiable sources. Then, RAFTS forms contrastive arguments (i.e., supporting or refuting) conditioned on the retrieved evidence. In addition, RAFTS leverages an embedding model to identify informative demonstrations, followed by in-context prompting to generate the prediction and explanation. Our method effectively retrieves relevant documents as evidence and evaluates arguments from varying perspectives, incorporating nuanced information for fine-grained decision-making. Combined with informative in-context examples as prior, RAFTS achieves significant improvements to supervised and LLM baselines without complex prompts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments, where RAFTS can outperform GPT-based methods with a significantly smaller 7B LLM.",
    "Retrieval-augmented generation in multilingual settings": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising solution for incorporating up-to-date or domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) and improving LLM factuality, but is predominantly studied in English-only settings. In this work, we consider RAG in the multilingual setting (mRAG), i.e. with user queries and the datastore in 13 languages, and investigate which components and with which adjustments are needed to build a well-performing mRAG pipeline, that can be used as a strong baseline in future works. Our findings highlight that despite the availability of high-quality off-the-shelf multilingual retrievers and generators, task-specific prompt engineering is needed to enable generation in user languages. Moreover, current evaluation metrics need adjustments for multilingual setting, to account for variations in spelling named entities. The main limitations to be addressed in future works include frequent code-switching in non-Latin alphabet languages, occasional fluency errors, wrong reading of the provided documents, or irrelevant retrieval. We release the code for the resulting mRAG baseline pipeline at https://github.com/naver/bergen1.",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Integration into Language Models: A Survey": "This survey analyses how external knowledge can be integrated into language models in the context of retrieval-augmentation. The main goal of this work is to give an overview of: (1) Which external knowledge can be augmented? (2) Given a knowledge source, how to retrieve from it and then integrate the retrieved knowledge? To achieve this, we define and give a mathematical formulation of retrieval-augmented knowledge integration (RAKI). We discuss retrieval and integration techniques separately in detail, for each of the following knowledge formats: knowledge graph, tabular and natural language.",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Multilingual Knowledge Editing": "Knowledge represented in Large Language Models (LLMs) is quite often incorrect and can also become obsolete over time. Updating knowledge via fine-tuning is computationally resource-hungry and not reliable, and so knowledge editing (KE) has developed as an effective and economical alternative to inject new knowledge or to fix factual errors in LLMs. Although there has been considerable interest in this area, current KE research exclusively focuses on monolingual settings, typically in English. However, what happens if the new knowledge is supplied in one language, but we would like to query an LLM in a different language? To address the problem of multilingual knowledge editing, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Multilingual Knowledge Editor (ReMaKE) to update knowledge in LLMs. ReMaKE can be used to perform model-agnostic knowledge editing in a multilingual setting. ReMaKE concatenates the new knowledge retrieved from a multilingual knowledge base with users' prompts before querying an LLM. Our experimental results show that ReMaKE outperforms baseline knowledge editing methods by a significant margin and is scalable to real-word application scenarios. Our multilingual knowledge editing dataset (MzsRE) in 12 languages, the code, and additional project information are available at https://github.com/weixuan-wang123/ReMaKE.",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Retrieval: Large Language Models are Strong Zero-Shot Retriever": "We propose a simple method that applies a large language model (LLM) to large-scale retrieval in zero-shot scenarios. Our method, the Large language model as Retriever (LameR), is built upon no other neural models but an LLM in a retrieval-augmented retrieval fashion, while breaking brute-force combinations of retrievers with LLMs and lifting the performance of zero-shot retrieval to be very competitive on benchmark datasets. Essentially, we propose to augment a query with its potential answers by prompting LLMs with a composition of the query and the query's in-domain candidates. The candidates, regardless of correct or wrong, are obtained by a vanilla retrieval procedure on the target collection. As a part of the prompts, they are likely to help LLM generate more precise answers by pattern imitation or candidate summarization. Even if all the candidates are wrong, the prompts at least make LLM aware of in-collection patterns and genres. Moreover, due to the low performance of a self-supervised retriever, the LLM-based query augmentation becomes less effective as the retriever bottlenecks the whole pipeline. Therefore, we propose to leverage a non-parametric lexicon-based method (e.g., BM25) as the retrieval module to capture query-document overlap in a literal fashion. As such, LameR makes the retrieval procedure transparent to the LLM, thus circumventing the bottleneck.",
    "RetrievalQA: Assessing Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Short-form Open-Domain Question Answering": "Adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (ARAG) aims to dynamically determine the necessity of retrieval for queries instead of retrieving indiscriminately to enhance the efficiency and relevance of the sourced information. However, previous works largely overlook the evaluation of ARAG approaches, leading to their effectiveness being understudied. This work presents a benchmark, RetrievalQA, comprising 1,271 short-form questions covering new world and long-tail knowledge. The knowledge necessary to answer the questions is absent from LLMs; therefore, external information must be retrieved to answer correctly. This makes RetrievalQA a suitable testbed to evaluate existing ARAG methods. We observe that calibration-based methods heavily rely on threshold tuning, while vanilla prompting is inadequate for guiding LLMs to make reliable retrieval decisions. Based on our findings, we propose Time-Aware Adaptive REtrieval (TA-ARE), a simple yet effective method that helps LLMs assess the necessity of retrieval without calibration or additional training.",
    "Revealing the Parametric Knowledge of Language Models: A Unified Framework for Attribution Methods": "Language Models (LMs) acquire parametric knowledge from their training process, embedding it within their weights. The increasing scalability of LMs, however, poses significant challenges for understanding a model's inner workings and further for updating or correcting this embedded knowledge without the significant cost of retraining. This underscores the importance of unveiling exactly what knowledge is stored and its association with specific model components. Instance Attribution (IA) and Neuron Attribution (NA) offer insights into this training-acquired knowledge, though they have not been compared systematically. Our study introduces a novel evaluation framework to quantify and compare the knowledge revealed by IA and NA. To align the results of the methods we introduce the attribution method NA-Instances to apply NA for retrieving influential training instances, and IA-Neurons to discover important neurons of influential instances discovered by IA. We further propose a comprehensive list of faithfulness tests to evaluate the comprehensiveness and sufficiency of the explanations provided by both methods. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that NA generally reveals more diverse and comprehensive information regarding the LM's parametric knowledge compared to IA. Nevertheless, IA provides unique and valuable insights into the LM's parametric knowledge, which are not revealed by NA. Our findings further suggest the potential of a synergistic approach of combining the diverse findings of IA and NA for a more holistic understanding of an LM's parametric knowledge.",
    "Revealing User Familiarity Bias in Task-Oriented Dialogue via Interactive Evaluation": "Most task-oriented dialogue (TOD) benchmarks assume users that know exactly how to use the system by constraining the user behaviors within the system's capabilities via strict user goals, namely “user familiarity” bias. This data bias deepens when it combines with data-driven TOD systems, as it is impossible to fathom the effect of it with existing static evaluations. Hence, we conduct an interactive user study to unveil how vulnerable TOD systems are against realistic scenarios. In particular, we compare users with 1) detailed goal instructions that conform to the system boundaries (closed-goal) and 2) vague goal instructions that are often unsupported but realistic (open-goal). Our study reveals that conversations in open-goal settings lead to catastrophic failures of the system, in which 92% of the dialogues had significant issues. Moreover, we conduct a thorough analysis to identify distinctive features between the two settings through error annotation. From this, we discover a novel “pretending” behavior, in which the system pretends to handle the user requests even though they are beyond the system's capabilities. We discuss its characteristics and toxicity while showing recent large language models can also suffer from this behavior.",
    "Revisiting Code Similarity Evaluation with Abstract Syntax Tree Edit Distance": "This paper revisits recent code similarity evaluation metrics, particularly focusing on the application of Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) editing distance in diverse programming languages. In particular, we explore the usefulness of these metrics and compare them to traditional sequence similarity metrics. Our experiments showcase the effectiveness of AST editing distance in capturing intricate code structures, revealing a high correlation with established metrics. Furthermore, we explore the strengths and weaknesses of AST editing distance and prompt-based GPT similarity scores in comparison to BLEU score, execution match, and Jaccard Similarity. We propose, optimize, and publish an adaptable metric that demonstrates effectiveness across all tested languages, representing an enhanced version of Tree Similarity of Edit Distance (TSED).",
    "Revisiting Demonstration Selection Strategies in In-Context Learning": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown an impressive ability to perform a wide range of tasks using in-context learning (ICL), where a few examples are used to describe a task to the model. However, the performance of ICL varies significantly with the choice of demonstrations, and previous research usually focuses on the data aspect ignoring the model's effect. In this work, we first revisit the factors contributing to this variance from the model aspect, and find that the demonstration choice is both data- and model-dependent. We further propose a conjecture that the performance of a demonstration positively correlates with its contribution to the model's understanding of the test samples, and accordingly propose a data-and model-dependent demonstration selection method, TopK + ConE. Empirically, our method yields consistent improvements in both language understanding and generation tasks with different model scales. Further analyses confirm that, besides the generality and stability under different circumstances, our method provides a unified explanation for the effectiveness of previous methods. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/Romainpkq/revisit_demon_selection_in_ICL.",
    "Revisiting Knowledge Distillation for Autoregressive Language Models": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a common approach to compress a teacher model to reduce its inference cost and memory footprint, by training a smaller student model. However, in the context of autoregressive language models (LMs), we empirically find that larger teachers might dramatically result in a poorer student. In response to this problem, we conduct a series of analyses and reveal that different tokens have different teaching modes, neglecting which will lead to performance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive teaching approach (ATKD) to improve the KD. The core of ATKD is to reduce rote learning and make teaching more diverse and flexible. Extensive experiments on 8 LM tasks show that, with the help of ATKD, various baseline KD methods can achieve consistent and significant performance gains (up to +3.04% average score) across all model types and sizes. More encouragingly, ATKD can improve the student model generalization effectively.",
    "Revisiting OPRO: The Limitations of Small-Scale LLMs as Optimizers": "Numerous recent works aim to enhance the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) through strategic prompting. In particular, the Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO) approach provides state-of-the-art performance by leveraging LLMs as optimizers where the optimization task is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy (Yang et al., 2023). In this paper, we revisit OPRO for automated prompting with relatively small-scale LLMs, such as LLaMa-2 family and Mistral 7B. Our investigation reveals that OPRO shows limited effectiveness in small-scale LLMs, with limited inference capabilities constraining optimization ability. We suggest future automatic prompting engineering to consider both model capabilities and computational costs. Additionally, for small-scale LLMs, we recommend direct instructions that clearly outline objectives and methodologies as robust prompt baselines, ensuring efficient and effective prompt engineering in ongoing research.",
    "Revisiting Parallel Context Windows: A Frustratingly Simple Alternative and Chain-of-Thought Deterioration": "We identify two crucial limitations in the evaluation of recent parallel-integrated method Parallel Context Windows (PCW) (Ratner et al., 2023), which extends the maximum context lengths of language models, e.g., 2048 for LLaMA, by harnessing window-wise attention and positional embedding techniques. We first show that a simple yet strong baseline, weighted sum ensemble, is missing for the in-context few-shot classification. Moreover, on more challenging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning (e.g., HotpotQA), PCW would present unexpected deterioration regarding question miscomprehension and false inference. Based on our findings, we suggest that the existing PCW design may not guarantee sufficient improvement and practicality in handling lengthy documents in real-world applications. More community efforts on enabling language models' long context understanding ability should be paid.",
    "Rewriting the Code: A Simple Method for Large Language Model Augmented Code Search": "In code search, the Generation-Augmented Retrieval (GAR) framework, which generates exemplar code snippets to augment queries, has emerged as a promising strategy to address the principal challenge of modality misalignment between code snippets and natural language queries, particularly with the demonstrated code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nevertheless, our preliminary investigations indicate that the improvements conferred by such an LLM-augmented framework are somewhat constrained. This limitation could potentially be ascribed to the fact that the generated codes, albeit functionally accurate, frequently display a pronounced stylistic deviation from the ground truth code in the codebase. In this paper, we extend the foundational GAR framework and propose a simple yet effective method that additionally Rewrites the Code (ReCo) within the codebase for style normalization. Experimental results demonstrate that ReCo significantly boosts retrieval accuracy across sparse (up to 35.7%), zero-shot dense (up to 27.6%), and fine-tuned dense (up to 23.6%) retrieval settings in diverse search scenarios. To further elucidate the advantages of ReCo and stimulate research in code style normalization, we introduce Code Style Similarity, the first metric tailored to quantify stylistic similarities in code. Notably, our empirical findings reveal the inadequacy of existing metrics in capturing stylistic nuances.",
    "Rich Semantic Knowledge Enhanced Large Language Models for Few-shot Chinese Spell Checking": "Chinese Spell Checking (CSC) is a widely used technology, which plays a vital role in speech to text (STT) and optical character recognition (OCR). Most of the existing CSC approaches relying on BERT architecture achieve excellent performance. However, limited by the scale of the foundation model, BERT-based method does not work well in few-shot scenarios, showing certain limitations in practical applications. In this paper, we explore using an in-context learning method named RS-LLM (Rich Semantic based LLMs) to introduce large language models (LLMs) as the foundation model. Besides, we study the impact of introducing various Chinese rich semantic information in our framework. We found that by introducing a small number of specific Chinese rich semantic structures, LLMs achieve better performance than most of the BERT-based model on few-shot CSC task. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on multiple datasets, and the experimental results verified the superiority of our proposed framework.",
    "RIFF: Learning to Rephrase Inputs for Few-shot Fine-tuning of Language Models": "Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) can be accurately fine-tuned for downstream text processing tasks. Recently, researchers have introduced several parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods that optimize input prompts or adjust a small number of model parameters (e.g., LoRA). In this study, we explore the impact of altering the input text of the original task in conjunction with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. To most effectively rewrite the input text, we train a few-shot paraphrase model with a Marginal Maximum Likelihood objective. Using six few-shot text classification datasets, we show that enriching data with paraphrases at train and test time enhances the performance beyond what can be achieved with parameter-efficient fine-tuning alone. The code used for our experiments can be found at https://github.com/SaeedNajafi/RIFF.",
    "RIGA at SMM4H-2024 Task 1: Enhancing ADE discovery with GPT-4": "The following is a description of the RIGA team's submissions for the SMM4H-2024 Task 1: Extraction and normalization of adverse drug events (ADEs) in English tweets. Our approach focuses on utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate data that enhances the fine-tuning of classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) models. Our solution significantly outperforms mean and median submissions of other teams. The efficacy of our ADE extraction from tweets is comparable to the current state-of-the-art solution, established as the task baseline. The code for our method is available on GitHub.",
    "RLHFPoison: Reward Poisoning Attack for Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback in Large Language Models": "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a methodology designed to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, playing an important role in LLMs alignment. Despite its advantages, RLHF relies on human annotators to rank the text, which can introduce potential security vulnerabilities if any adversarial annotator (i.e., attackers) manipulates the ranking score by up-ranking any malicious text to steer the LLM adversarially. To assess the red-teaming of RLHF against human preference data poisoning, we propose RankPoison, a poisoning attack method on candidates' selection of preference rank flipping to reach certain malicious behaviors (e.g., generating longer sequences, which can increase the computational cost). With poisoned dataset generated by RankPoison, we can perform poisoning attacks on LLMs to generate longer tokens without hurting the original safety alignment performance. Moreover, applying RankPoison, we also successfully implement a backdoor attack where LLMs can generate longer answers under questions with the trigger word. Our findings highlight critical security challenges in RLHF, underscoring the necessity for more robust alignment methods for LLMs.",
    "RoleLLM: Benchmarking, Eliciting, and Enhancing Role-Playing Abilities of Large Language Models": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has paved the way for complex tasks such as role-playing, which enhances user interactions by enabling models to imitate various characters. However, the closed-source nature of state-of-the-art LLMs and their general-purpose training limit role-playing optimization. In this paper, we introduce RoleLLM, a framework to benchmark, elicit, and enhance role-playing abilities in LLMs. RoleLLM comprises four stages: (1) Role Profile Construction for 100 roles; (2) Context-Based Instruction Generation (Context-Instruct) for role-specific knowledge extraction; (3) Role Prompting using GPT (RoleGPT) for speaking style imitation; and (4) Role-Conditioned Instruction Tuning (RoCIT) for fine-tuning open-source models along with role customization. By Context-Instruct and RoleGPT, we create RoleBench, the first systematic and fine-grained character-level benchmark dataset for role-playing with 168,093 samples. Moreover, RoCIT on RoleBench yields RoleLLaMA (English) and RoleGLM (Chinese), significantly enhancing role-playing abilities and even achieving comparable results with RoleGPT (using GPT-4).",
    "ROMANSETU: Efficiently unlocking multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models via Romanization": "This study addresses the challenge of extending Large Language Models (LLMs) to non-English languages that use non-Roman scripts. We propose an approach that utilizes the romanized form of text as an interface for LLMs, hypothesizing that its frequent informal use and shared tokens with English enhance cross-lingual alignment. Our approach involves the continual pretraining of an English LLM like Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023) on romanized text of non-English, non-Roman script languages, followed by instruction tuning on romanized data. The results indicate that romanized text not only reduces token fertility by 2x-4x but also matches or outperforms native script representation across various NLU, NLG, and MT tasks. Moreover, the embeddings computed on romanized text exhibit closer alignment with their English translations than those from the native script. Our approach presents a promising direction for leveraging the power of English LLMs in languages traditionally underrepresented in NLP. Our code is available on https://github.com/AI4Bharat/romansetu.",
    "ROSE Doesn't Do That: Boosting the Safety of Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models with Reverse Prompt Contrastive Decoding": "With the development of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), improving the safety of LLMs has become more critical. However, the current approaches for aligning the LLMs output with expected safety usually require substantial training efforts, e.g., high-quality safety data and expensive computational resources, which are costly and inefficient. To this end, we present Reverse prOmpt contraStive dEcoding (ROSE), a simple-yet-effective method to directly boost the safety of existing instruction-tuned LLMs without any additional training. The principle of ROSE is to improve the probability of desired safe output via suppressing the undesired output induced by the carefully-designed reverse prompts. Experiments on 6 safety and 2 general-purpose tasks show that, our ROSE not only brings consistent and significant safety improvements (up to +13.8% safety score) upon 5 types of instruction-tuned LLMs, but also benefits the general-purpose ability of LLMs. In-depth analyses explore the underlying mechanism of ROSE, and reveal when and where to use it.",
    "Roux-lette at “Discharge Me!”: Reducing EHR Chart Burden with a Simple, Scalable, Clinician-Driven AI Approach": "Healthcare providers spend a significant amount of time reading and synthesizing electronic health records (EHRs), negatively impacting patient outcomes and causing provider burnout. Traditional supervised machine learning approaches using large language models (LLMs) to summarize clinical text have struggled due to hallucinations and lack of relevant training data. Here, we present a novel, simplified solution for the “Discharge Me!” shared task. Our solution uses a question-based approach to treat this summarization task as a context-aware and domain-specific question-answering process. Our pipeline prompts an LLM to answer specific questions posed by subject-matter experts (SMEs) using only patient-specific context data. This method (i) avoids hallucinations through hybrid RAG/zero-shot contextualized prompting; (ii) requires no extensive training or fine-tuning; and (iii) is adaptable to various clinical tasks.",
    "RRNorm: A Novel Framework for Chinese Disease Diagnoses Normalization via LLM-Driven Terminology Component Recognition and Reconstruction": "The Clinical Terminology Normalization aims at finding standard terms from a given termbase for mentions extracted from clinical texts. However, we found that extracted mentions suffer from the multi-implication problem, especially disease diagnoses. The reason for this is that physicians often use abbreviations, conjunctions, and juxtapositions when writing diagnoses, and it is difficult to manually decompose. To address this problem, we propose a Terminology Component Recognition and Reconstruction strategy that leverages the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize the components of terms, enabling automated decomposition and transforming original mentions into multiple atomic mentions. Furthermore, we adopt the mainstream “Recall and Rank” framework to apply the benefits of the above strategy to the task flow. By leveraging the LLM incorporating the advanced sampling strategies, we design a sampling algorithm for atomic mentions and train the recall model using contrastive learning. Besides the information about the components is also used as knowledge to guide the final term ranking and selection. The experimental results show that our proposed strategy effectively improves the performance of the terminology normalization task and our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art on the experimental dataset. We release our code and data on the repository RRNorm.",
    "Rule or Story, Which is a Better Commonsense Expression for Talking with Large Language Models?": "Building machines with commonsense has been a longstanding challenge in NLP due to the reporting bias of commonsense rules and the exposure bias of rule-based commonsense reasoning. In contrast, humans convey and pass down commonsense implicitly through stories. This paper investigates the inherent commonsense ability of large language models (LLMs) expressed through storytelling. We systematically investigate and compare stories and rules for retrieving and leveraging commonsense in LLMs. Experimental results on 28 commonsense QA datasets show that stories outperform rules as the expression for retrieving commonsense from LLMs, exhibiting higher generation confidence and commonsense accuracy. Moreover, stories are the more effective commonsense expression for answering questions regarding daily events, while rules are more effective for scientific questions. This aligns with the reporting bias of commonsense in text corpora. We further show that the correctness and relevance of commonsense stories can be further improved via iterative self-supervised fine-tuning. These findings emphasize the importance of using appropriate language to express, retrieve, and leverage commonsense for LLMs, highlighting a promising direction for better exploiting their commonsense abilities.",
    "Rule-Based, Neural and LLM Back-Translation: Comparative Insights from a Variant of Ladin": "This paper explores the impact of different back-translation approaches on machine translation for Ladin, specifically the Val Badia variant. Given the limited amount of parallel data available for this language (only 18k Ladin-Italian sentence pairs), we investigate the performance of a multilingual neural machine translation model fine-tuned for Ladin-Italian. In addition to the available authentic data, we synthesise further translations by using three different models: a fine-tuned neural model, a rule-based system developed specifically for this language pair, and a large language model. Our experiments show that all approaches achieve comparable translation quality in this low-resource scenario, yet round-trip translations highlight differences in model performance.",
    "S3-DST: Structured Open-Domain Dialogue Segmentation and State Tracking in the Era of LLMs": "Traditional Dialogue State Tracking (DST) has focused on tracking preferences and intents in conversations centered around specific tasks (e.g. booking services). These conventional systems assume a relatively restricted conversation flow in which each turn gradually offers new information. However, advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in more versatile open-domain chat systems in which extended dialogue sessions encompassing numerous tasks and topics are common—in turn requiring new conversational tracking tools in order to successfully orchestrate such systems. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel approach combining dialogue segmentation and state tracking within open-domain dialogues, tailored for zero-shot applications appropriate to a true open-domain dialogue system. Our proposed method S3-DST employs a unique structured prompting technique called Pre-Analytical Recollection, a novel grounding mechanism we designed for improving long context tracking. Tested on proprietary anonymized open-domain dialogue datasets as well as publicly available DST and segmentation datasets, S3-DST consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, showcasing its effectiveness and adaptability state tracking in the next wave of LLM-based chat systems. We also release S3-DST annotations with GPT-4 on a curated subset of LMSYS-Chat-1M (Zheng et al., 2023) to be used as a testbed to fuel research in this direction.",
    "SAC-KG: Exploiting Large Language Models as Skilled Automatic Constructors for Domain Knowledge Graphs": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a pivotal role in knowledge-intensive tasks across specialized domains, where the acquisition of precise and dependable knowledge is crucial. However, existing KG construction methods heavily rely on human intervention to attain qualified KGs, which severely hinders the practical applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a general KG construction framework, named SAC-KG, to exploit large language models (LLMs) as Skilled Automatic Constructors for domain Knowledge Graph. SAC-KG effectively involves LLMs as domain experts to generate specialized and precise multi-level KGs. Specifically, SAC-KG consists of three components: Generator, Verifier, and Pruner. For a given entity, Generator produces its relations and tails from raw domain corpora, to construct a specialized single-level KG. Verifier and Pruner then work together to ensure precision by correcting generation errors and determining whether newly produced tails require further iteration for the next-level KG. Experiments demonstrate that SAC-KG automatically constructs a domain KG at the scale of over one million nodes and achieves a precision of 89.32%, leading to a superior performance with over 20% increase in precision rate compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for the KG construction task.",
    "SafeDecoding: Defending against Jailbreak Attacks via Safety-Aware Decoding": "As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications such as code generation and chatbot assistance, extensive efforts have been made to align LLM behavior with human values, including safety. Jailbreak attacks, aiming to provoke unintended and unsafe behaviors from LLMs, remain a significant LLM safety threat. In this paper, we aim to defend LLMs against jailbreak attacks by introducing SafeDecoding, a safety-aware decoding strategy for LLMs to generate helpful and harmless responses to user queries. Our insight in developing SafeDecoding is based on the observation that, even though probabilities of tokens representing harmful contents outweigh those representing harmless responses, safety disclaimers still appear among the top tokens after sorting tokens by probability in descending order. This allows us to mitigate jailbreak attacks by identifying safety disclaimers and amplifying their token probabilities, while simultaneously attenuating the probabilities of token sequences that are aligned with the objectives of jailbreak attacks. We perform extensive experiments on five LLMs using six state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks and four benchmark datasets. Our results show that SafeDecoding significantly reduces attack success rate and harmfulness of jailbreak attacks without compromising the helpfulness of responses to benign user queries while outperforming six defense methods.",
    "Safety Alignment in NLP Tasks: Weakly Aligned Summarization as an In-Context Attack": "Recent developments in balancing the usefulness and safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised a critical question: Are mainstream NLP tasks adequately aligned with safety consideration? Our study, focusing on safety-sensitive documents obtained through adversarial attacks, reveals significant disparities in the safety alignment of various NLP tasks. For instance, LLMs can effectively summarize malicious long documents but often refuse to translate them. This discrepancy highlights a previously unidentified vulnerability: attacks exploiting tasks with weaker safety alignment, like summarization, can potentially compromise the integrity of tasks traditionally deemed more robust, such as translation and question-answering (QA). Moreover, the concurrent use of multiple NLP tasks with lesser safety alignment increases the risk of LLMs inadvertently processing harmful content. We demonstrate these vulnerabilities in various safety-aligned LLMs, particularly Llama2 models, Gemini and GPT-4, indicating an urgent need for strengthening safety alignments across a broad spectrum of NLP tasks.",
    "SafetyBench: Evaluating the Safety of Large Language Models": "With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), increasing attention has been paid to their safety concerns. Consequently, evaluating the safety of LLMs has become an essential task for facilitating the broad applications of LLMs. Nevertheless, the absence of comprehensive safety evaluation benchmarks poses a significant impediment to effectively assess and enhance the safety of LLMs. In this work, we present SafetyBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the safety of LLMs, which comprises 11,435 diverse multiple choice questions spanning across 7 distinct categories of safety concerns. Notably, SafetyBench also incorporates both Chinese and English data, facilitating the evaluation in both languages. Our extensive tests over 25 popular Chinese and English LLMs in both zero-shot and few-shot settings reveal a substantial performance advantage for GPT-4 over its counterparts, and there is still significant room for improving the safety of current LLMs. We also demonstrate that the measured safety understanding abilities in SafetyBench are correlated with safety generation abilities. Data and evaluation guidelines are available at https://github.com/thu-coai/SafetyBench. Submission entrance and leaderboard are available at https://llmbench.ai/safety.",
    "SAGA: A Participant-specific Examination of Story Alternatives and Goal Applicability for a Deeper Understanding of Complex Events": "Interpreting and assessing goal driven actions is vital to understanding and reasoning over complex events. It is important to be able to acquire the knowledge needed for this understanding, though doing so is challenging. We argue that such knowledge can be elicited through a participant achievement lens. We analyze a complex event in a narrative according to the intended achievements of the participants in that narrative, the likely future actions of the participants, and the likelihood of goal success. We collect 6.3K high quality goal and action annotations reflecting our proposed participant achievement lens, with an average weighted Fleiss-Kappa IAA of 80%. Our collection contains annotated alternate versions of each narrative. These alternate versions vary minimally from the “original” story, but can license drastically different inferences. Our findings suggest that while modern large language models can reflect some of the goal-based knowledge we study, they find it challenging to fully capture the design and intent behind concerted actions, even when the model pretraining included the data from which we extracted the goal knowledge. We show that smaller models fine-tuned on our dataset can achieve performance surpassing larger models.",
    "SALAD-Bench: A Hierarchical and Comprehensive Safety Benchmark for Large Language Models": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring robust safety measures is paramount. To meet this crucial need, we propose SALAD-Bench, a safety benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLMs, attack, and defense methods. Distinguished by its breadth, SALAD-Bench transcends conventional benchmarks through its large scale, rich diversity, intricate taxonomy spanning three levels, and versatile functionalities. SALAD-Bench is crafted with a meticulous array of questions, from standard queries to complex ones enriched with attack, defense modifications and multiple-choice. To effectively manage the inherent complexity, we introduce an innovative evaluator: the LLM-based MD-Judge for QA pairs with a particular focus on attack-enhanced queries, ensuring a seamless and reliable evaluation. These components extend SALAD-Bench from standard LLM safety evaluation to both LLM attack and defense methods evaluation, ensuring the joint-purpose utility. Our extensive experiments shed light on the resilience of LLMs against emerging threats and the efficacy of contemporary defense tactics. Data and evaluator are released under https://github.com/OpenSafetyLab/SALAD-BENCH.",
    "Same Task, More Tokens: the Impact of Input Length on the Reasoning Performance of Large Language Models": "This paper explores the impact of extending input lengths on the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite LLMs advancements in recent times, their performance consistency across different input lengths is not well understood. We investigate this aspect by introducing a novel QA reasoning framework, specifically designed to assess the impact of input length. We isolate the effect of input length using multiple versions of the same sample, each being extended with padding of different lengths, types, and locations. Our findings show a notable degradation in LLMs' reasoning performance at much shorter input lengths than their technical maximum. We show that the degradation trend appears in every version of our dataset, although at different intensities. Additionally, our study reveals that the traditional metric of next word prediction correlates negatively with performance of LLMs' on our reasoning dataset. We analyze our results and identify failure modes that can serve as useful guides for future research, potentially informing strategies to address the limitations observed in LLMs.",
    "SAPT: A Shared Attention Framework for Parameter-Efficient Continual Learning of Large Language Models": "The continual learning (CL) ability is vital for deploying large language models (LLMs) in the dynamic world. Existing methods devise the learning module to acquire task-specific knowledge with parameter-efficient tuning (PET) block and the selection module to pick out the corresponding one for the testing input, aiming at handling the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and knowledge transfer in CL. However, these methods tend to address only one of the challenges, ignoring the potential of aligning the two modules to effectively address catastrophic forgetting and knowledge transfer simultaneously. To this end, we propose a novel Shared Attention Framework (SAPT), to align the PET learning and selection via the Shared Attentive Learning & Selection module. Extensive experiments on two CL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SAPT. Moreover, SAPT consistently demonstrates its superiority when we scale it to different model sizes (from 770M to 13B), different model architectures (T5 and LLaMA-2) and unseen tasks.",
    "SCALE: Synergized Collaboration of Asymmetric Language Translation Engines": "In this paper, we introduce SCALE, a collaborative framework that connects a compact Specialized Translation Model (STM) and a general-purpose Large Language Model (LLM) as one unified translation engine. By introducing translation from STM into the triplet in-context demonstrations, SCALE unlocks refinement and pivoting ability of LLM, thus 1) mitigating language bias of LLMs and parallel data bias of STMs, 2) enhancing LLM speciality without sacrificing generality, and 3) facilitating continual learning in a LLM-tuning-free way. Our comprehensive experiments show that SCALE significantly outperforms both LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5) and supervised models (NLLB, M2M) in either high-resource or challenging low-resource settings. Moreover SCALE demonstrates the scalability by only updating the lightweight STM and witness consistent system improvement, an averaged 4 BLEURT score across 4 languages without tuning LLM. Interestingly, SCALE could also effectively exploit the existing language bias of LLMs by using an English-centric STM as a pivot to conduct translation between any language pairs, outperforming GPT-4 by an average of 6 COMET points across eight translation directions. Furthermore we provide an in-depth analysis of SCALE's robustness, translation characteristics, latency costs and inherent language bias, providing solid foundation for future studies exploring the potential synergy between LLMs and more specialized models.",
    "SceMQA: A Scientific College Entrance Level Multimodal Question Answering Benchmark": "The paper introduces SceMQA, a novel benchmark for scientific multimodal question answering at the college entrance level. It addresses a critical educational phase often overlooked in existing benchmarks, spanning high school to pre-college levels. SceMQA focuses on core science subjects including Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. It features a blend of multiple-choice and free-response formats, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of AI models' abilities. Additionally, our benchmark provides specific knowledge points for each problem and detailed explanations for each answer. SceMQA also uniquely presents problems with identical contexts but varied questions to facilitate a more thorough and accurate assessment of reasoning capabilities. In the experiment, we evaluate both open-source and close-source state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), across various experimental settings. The results show that further research and development are needed in developing more capable MLLM, as highlighted by only 50% to 60% accuracy achieved by the strongest models.",
    "SCIMON: Scientific Inspiration Machines Optimized for Novelty": "We explore and enhance the ability of neural language models to generate novel scientific directions grounded in literature. Work on literature-based hypothesis generation has traditionally focused on binary link prediction—severely limiting the expressivity of hypotheses. This line of work also does not focus on optimizing novelty. We take a dramatic departure with a novel setting in which models use as input background contexts (e.g., problems, experimental settings, goals), and output natural language ideas grounded in literature. We present SCIMON, a modeling framework that uses retrieval of “inspirations” from past scientific papers, and explicitly optimizes for novelty by iteratively comparing to prior papers and updating idea suggestions until sufficient novelty is achieved. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that GPT-4 tends to generate ideas with overall low technical depth and novelty, while our methods partially mitigate this issue. Our work represents a first step toward evaluating and developing language models that generate new ideas derived from the scientific literature.",
    "SDA: Semantic Discrepancy Alignment for Text-conditioned Image Retrieval": "In the realm of text-conditioned image retrieval, models utilize a query composed of a reference image and modification text to retrieve corresponding images. Despite its significance, this task is fraught with challenges, including small-scale datasets due to labeling costs and the complexity of attributes in modification texts. These challenges often result in models learning a generalized representation of the query, thereby missing the semantic correlations of image and text attributes. In this paper, we introduce a general boosting framework designed to address these issues by employing semantic discrepancy alignment. Our framework first leverages the ChatGPT to augment text data by modifying the original modification text's attributes. The augmented text is then combined with the original reference image to create an augmented composed query. Then we generate corresponding images using GPT-4 for the augmented composed query. We realize the cross-modal semantic discrepancy alignment by formulating distance consistency and neighbor consistency between the image and text domains. Through this novel approach, attributes in the text domain can be more effectively transferred to the image domain, enhancing retrieval performance. Extensive experiments on three prominent datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, with state-of-the-art results on a majority of evaluation metrics compared to various baseline methods.",
    "SDG target detection in environmental reports using Retrieval-augmented Generation with LLMs": "With the consolidation of Large Language Models (LLM) as a dominant component in approaches for multiple linguistic tasks, the interest in these technologies has greatly increased within a variety of areas and domains. A particular scenario of information needs where to exploit these approaches is climate-aware NLP. Paradigmatically, the vast manual labour of inspecting long, heterogeneous documents to find environment-relevant expressions and claims suits well within a recently established Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) framework. In this paper, we tackle dual problems within environment analysis dealing with the common goal of detecting a Sustainable Developmental Goal (SDG) target being addressed in a textual passage of an environmental assessment report. We develop relevant test collections, and propose and evaluate a series of methods within the general RAG pipeline, in order to assess the current capabilities of LLMs for the tasks of SDG target evidence identification and SDG target detection.",
    "Se2: Sequential Example Selection for In-Context Learning": "The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) for in-context learning (ICL) needs to be activated by demonstration examples. Prior work has extensively explored the selection of examples for ICL, predominantly following the select then organize paradigm, such approaches often neglect the internal relationships between examples and exist an inconsistency between the training and inference. In this paper, we formulate the problem as a Sequential Selection problem and introduce Se2, a sequential-aware method that leverages the LLM's feedback on varying context, aiding in capturing inter-relationships and sequential information among examples, significantly enriching the contextuality and relevance of ICL prompts. Meanwhile, we utilize beam search to seek and construct example sequences, enhancing both quality and diversity. Extensive experiments across 23 NLP tasks from 8 distinct categories illustrate that Se2 markedly surpasses competitive baselines and achieves 42% relative improvement over random selection. Further in-depth analysis shows the effectiveness of proposed strategies, highlighting Se2's exceptional stability and adaptability across various scenarios.",
    "SEA-VQA: Southeast Asian Cultural Context Dataset For Visual Question Answering": "Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a critical task requiring the simultaneous understanding of visual and textual information. While significant advancements have been made with multilingual datasets, these often lack cultural specificity, especially in the context of Southeast Asia (SEA). In this paper, we introduce SEA-VQA, aiming to highlight the challenges and gaps in existing VQA models when confronted with culturally specific content. Our dataset includes images from eight SEA countries, curated from the UNESCO Cultural Heritage collection. Our evaluation, comparing GPT-4 and GEMINI models, demonstrates substantial performance drops on culture-centric questions compared to the A-OKVQA dataset, a commonsense and world-knowledge VQA benchmark comprising approximately 25,000 questions. Our findings underscore the importance of cultural diversity in VQA datasets and reveal substantial gaps in the ability of current VQA models to handle culturally rich contexts. SEA-VQA serves as a crucial benchmark for identifying these gaps and guiding future improvements in VQA systems.",
    "SeaLLMs - Large Language Models for Southeast Asia": "Despite the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various tasks, there remains a linguistic bias that favors high-resource languages, such as English, often at the expense of low-resource and regional languages. To address this imbalance, we introduce SeaLLMs, an innovative series of language models that specifically focuses on Southeast Asian (SEA) languages. SeaLLMs are built upon popular English-centric models through continued pre-training with an extended vocabulary, specialized instruction and alignment tuning to better capture the intricacies of regional languages. This allows them to respect and reflect local cultural norms, customs, stylistic preferences, and legal considerations. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SeaLLM models exhibit superior performance across a wide spectrum of linguistic tasks and assistant-style instruction-following capabilities relative to comparable open-source models. Moreover, they outperform ChatGPT-3.5 in non-Latin languages, such as Thai, Khmer, Lao, and Burmese, by large margins while remaining lightweight and cost-effective to operate.",
    "Search-Adaptor: Embedding Customization for Information Retrieval": "Embeddings extracted by pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant potential to improve information retrieval and search. Beyond the zero-shot setup in which they are being conventionally used, being able to take advantage of the information from the relevant query-corpus paired data can further boost the LLM capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Search-Adaptor, for customizing LLMs for information retrieval in an efficient and robust way. Search-Adaptor modifies the embeddings generated by pre-trained LLMs, and can be integrated with any LLM, including those only available via prediction APIs. On multiple English, multilingual, and multimodal retrieval datasets, we show consistent and significant performance benefits for Search-Adaptor - e.g., more than 5% improvements for Google Embedding APIs in nDCG@10 averaged over 14 BEIR datasets.",
    "Seed-Free Synthetic Data Generation Framework for Instruction-Tuning LLMs: A Case Study in Thai": "We present a synthetic data approach for instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) for low-resource languages in a data-efficient manner, specifically focusing on Thai. We identify three key properties that contribute to the effectiveness of instruction-tuning datasets: fluency, diversity, and cultural context. We propose a seed-data-free framework for generating synthetic instruction-tuning data that incorporates these essential properties. Our framework employs an LLM to generate diverse topics, retrieve relevant contexts from Wikipedia, and create instructions for various tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and conversation. The experimental results show that our best-performing synthetic dataset, which incorporates all three key properties, achieves competitive performance using only 5,000 instructions when compared to state-of-the-art Thai LLMs trained on hundreds of thousands of instructions. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/parinzee/seed-free-synthetic-instruct.",
    "SeeGULL Multilingual: a Dataset of Geo-Culturally Situated Stereotypes": "While generative multilingual models are rapidly being deployed, their safety and fairness evaluations are largely limited to resources collected in English. This is especially problematic for evaluations targeting inherently socio-cultural phenomena such as stereotyping, where it is important to build multilingual resources that reflect the stereotypes prevalent in respective language communities. However, gathering these resources, at scale, in varied languages and regions pose a significant challenge as it requires broad socio-cultural knowledge and can also be prohibitively expensive. To overcome this critical gap, we employ a recently introduced approach that couples LLM generations for scale with culturally situated validations for reliability, and build SeeGULL Multilingual, a global-scale multilingual dataset of social stereotypes, containing over 25K stereotypes, spanning 23 pairs of languages and regions they are common in, with human annotations, and demonstrate its utility in identifying gaps in model evaluations. Content warning: Stereotypes shared in this paper can be offensive.",
    "SEGO: Sequential Subgoal Optimization for Mathematical Problem-Solving": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven substantial progress in artificial intelligence in recent years, exhibiting impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including mathematical problem-solving. Inspired by the success of subgoal-based methods, we propose a novel framework called SEquential subGoal Optimization (SEGO) to enhance LLMs' ability to solve mathematical problems. By establishing a connection between the subgoal breakdown process and the probability of solving problems, SEGO aims to identify better subgoals with theoretical guarantees. Addressing the challenge of identifying suitable subgoals in a large solution space, our framework generates problem-specific subgoals and adjusts them according to carefully designed criteria. Incorporating these optimized subgoals into the policy model training leads to significant improvements in problem-solving performance. We validate SEGO's efficacy through experiments on two benchmarks, GSM8K and MATH, where our approach outperforms existing methods, highlighting the potential of SEGO in AI-driven mathematical problem-solving.",
    "Selective Prefix Tuning for Pre-trained Language Models": "The prevalent approach for optimizing pre-trained language models in downstream tasks is fine-tuning. However, it is both time-consuming and memory-inefficient. In response, a more efficient method called Prefix Tuning, which inserts learnable vectors into each Transformer layers, has been proposed and proven effective. Recent investigations reveal that prefix tokens carry context-specific information, prompting the hypothesis that enhancing their specialization can improve model performance. To address this, we propose Selective Prefix Tuning (SPT), integrating a selective mechanism inspired by selective self-attention. Additionally, we introduce Selective Loss (SL) to encourage diversity in prefix tokens. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of SPT in sentence and token classification tasks. We contribute insight into understanding the role of prefix in model adaptation.",
    "Selective Prompting Tuning for Personalized Conversations with LLMs": "In conversational AI, personalizing dialogues with persona profiles and contextual understanding is essential. Despite large language models' (LLMs) improved response coherence, effective persona integration remains a challenge. In this work, we first study two common approaches for personalizing LLMs: textual prompting and direct fine-tuning. We observed that textual prompting often struggles to yield responses that are similar to the ground truths in datasets, while direct fine-tuning tends to produce repetitive or overly generic replies. To alleviate those issues, we propose Selective Prompt Tuning (SPT), which softly prompts LLMs for personalized conversations in a selective way. Concretely, SPT initializes a set of soft prompts and uses a trainable dense retriever to adaptively select suitable soft prompts for LLMs according to different input contexts, where the prompt retriever is dynamically updated through feedback from the LLMs. Additionally, we propose context-prompt contrastive learning and prompt fusion learning to encourage the SPT to enhance the diversity of personalized conversations. Experiments on the CONVAI2 dataset demonstrate that SPT significantly enhances response diversity by up to 90%, along with improvements in other critical performance indicators. Those results highlight the efficacy of SPT in fostering engaging and personalized dialogue generation. The SPT model code is publicly available for further exploration.",
    "Selective Reflection-Tuning: Student-Selected Data Recycling for LLM Instruction-Tuning": "Instruction tuning is critical to large language models (LLMs) for achieving better instruction following and task adaptation capabilities but its success heavily relies on the training data quality. Many recent methods focus on improving the data quality but often overlook the compatibility of the data with the student model being finetuned. This paper introduces Selective Reflection-Tuning, a novel paradigm that synergizes a teacher LLM's reflection and introspection for improving existing data quality with the data selection capability of the student LLM, to automatically refine existing instruction-tuning data. This teacher-student collaboration produces high-quality and student-compatible instruction-response pairs, resulting in sample-efficient instruction tuning and LLMs of superior performance. Selective Reflection-Tuning is a data augmentation and synthesis that generally improves LLM finetuning and self-improvement without collecting brand-new data. We apply our method to Alpaca and WizardLM data and achieve much stronger and top-tier 7B and 13B LLMs.",
    "Selective “Selective Prediction”: Reducing Unnecessary Abstention in Vision-Language Reasoning": "Selective prediction minimizes incorrect predictions from vision-language models (VLMs) by allowing them to abstent from answering when uncertain. However, when deploying a vision-language system with low tolerance for inaccurate predictions, selective prediction may be over-cautious and abstain too frequently, even on many correct predictions. We introduce ReCoVERR, an inference-time algorithm to reduce the over-abstention of a selective vision-language system without increasing the error rate of the system's predictions. When the VLM makes a low-confidence prediction, instead of abstaining ReCoVERR tries to find relevant clues in the image that provide additional evidence for the prediction. ReCoVERR uses an LLM to pose related questions to the VLM, collects high-confidence evidences, and if enough evidence confirms the prediction the system makes a prediction instead of abstaining. ReCoVERR enables three VLMs (BLIP2, InstructBLIP and LLaVA-1.5) to answer up to 20% more questions on the VQAv2 and A-OKVQA tasks without decreasing system accuracy, thus improving overall system reliability. Our code is available at https://github.com/tejas1995/ReCoVERR.",
    "Selectively Answering Visual Questions": "Recently, large multi-modal models (LMMs) have emerged with the capacity to perform vision tasks such as captioning and visual question answering (VQA) with unprecedented accuracy. Applications such as helping the blind or visually impaired have a critical need for precise answers. It is specially important for models to be well calibrated and be able to quantify their uncertainty in order to selectively decide when to answer and when to abstain or ask for clarifications. We perform the first in-depth analysis of calibration methods and metrics for VQA with in-context learning LMMs. Studying VQA on two answerability benchmarks, we show that the likelihood score of visually grounded models is better calibrated than in their text-only counterparts for in-context learning, where sampling based methods are generally superior, but no clear winner arises. We propose AVG BLEU, a calibration score combining the benefits of both sampling and likelihood methods across modalities.",
    "Selene: Pioneering Automated Proof in Software Verification": "Ensuring correctness is a pivotal aspect of software engineering. Among various strategies available, software verification offers a definitive assurance of correctness. Nevertheless, writing verification proofs is resource-intensive and manpower-consuming, and there is a great need to automate this process. We introduce Selene in this paper, which is the first project-level automated proof benchmark constructed based on the real-world industrial-level operating system microkernel, seL4. Selene provides a comprehensive framework for end-to-end proof generation and a lightweight verification environment. Our experimental results with advanced large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, highlight the capabilities of LLMs in the domain of automated proof generation. Additionally, our further proposed augmentations indicate that the challenges presented by Selene can be mitigated in future research endeavors.",
    "Just Ask One More Time! Self-Agreement Improves Reasoning of Language Models in (Almost) All Scenarios": "Although chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting combined with language models has achieved encouraging results on complex reasoning tasks, the naive greedy decoding used in CoT prompting usually causes the repetitiveness and local optimality. To address this shortcoming, ensemble-optimization tries to obtain multiple reasoning paths to get the final answer assembly. However, current ensemble-optimization methods either simply employ rule-based post-processing such as self-consistency, or train an additional model based on several task-related human annotations to select the best one among multiple reasoning paths, yet fail to generalize to realistic settings where the type of input questions is unknown or the answer format of reasoning paths is unknown. To avoid their limitations, we propose Self-Agreement, a generalizable ensemble-optimization method applying in almost all scenarios where the type of input questions and the answer format of reasoning paths may be known or unknown. Self-agreement firstly samples from language model's decoder to generate a diverse set of reasoning paths, and subsequently prompts the language model one more time to determine the optimal answer by selecting the most agreed answer among the sampled reasoning paths. Self-agreement simultaneously achieves remarkable performance on six public reasoning benchmarks and superior generalization capabilities.",
    "Self-Alignment for Factuality: Mitigating Hallucinations in LLMs via Self-Evaluation": "Despite showing impressive abilities, large language models (LLMs) often struggle with factual inaccuracies, i.e., “hallucinations”, even when they hold relevant knowledge. To mitigate these hallucinations, current approaches typically necessitate high-quality human factuality annotations. In this work, we explore Self-Alignment for Factuality, where we leverage the self-evaluation capability of an LLM to provide training signals that steer the model towards factuality. Specifically, we incorporate SELF-EVAL, a self-evaluation component, to prompt an LLM to validate the factuality of its own generated responses solely based on its internal knowledge. Additionally, we design S¯ elf-K¯ nowledge Tuning (SK-TUNING) to augment the LLM's self-evaluation ability by improving the model's confidence estimation and calibration. We then utilize these self-annotated responses to fine-tune the model via Direct Preference Optimization algorithm. We show that the proposed self-alignment approach substantially enhances factual accuracy over LLAMA family models across three key knowledge-intensive tasks on TruthfulQA and BioGEN.",
    "Self-Augmented In-Context Learning for Unsupervised Word Translation": "Recent work has shown that, while large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong word translation or bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) capabilities in few-shot setups, they still cannot match the performance of 'traditional' mapping-based approaches in the unsupervised scenario where no seed translation pairs are available, especially for lower-resource languages. To address this challenge with LLMs, we propose self-augmented in-context learning (SAIL) for unsupervised BLI: starting from a zero-shot prompt, SAIL iteratively induces a set of high-confidence word translation pairs for in-context learning (ICL) from an LLM, which it then reapplies to the same LLM in the ICL fashion. Our method shows substantial gains over zero-shot prompting of LLMs on two established BLI benchmarks spanning a wide range of language pairs, also outperforming mapping-based baselines across the board. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art unsupervised BLI performance, we also conduct comprehensive analyses on SAIL and discuss its limitations.",
    "Self-chats from Large Language Models Make Small Emotional Support Chatbot Better": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong generalization abilities to excel in various tasks, including emotion support conversations. However, deploying such LLMs like GPT-3 (175B parameters) is resource-intensive and challenging at scale. In this study, we utilize LLMs as “Counseling Teacher” to enhance smaller models' emotion support response abilities, significantly reducing the necessity of scaling up model size. To this end, we first introduce an iterative expansion framework, aiming to prompt the large teacher model to curate an expansive emotion support dialogue dataset. This curated dataset, termed ExTES, encompasses a broad spectrum of scenarios and is crafted with meticulous strategies to ensure its quality and comprehensiveness. Based on this, we then devise a Diverse Response Inpainting (DRI) mechanism to harness the teacher model to produce multiple diverse responses by filling in the masked conversation context. This richness and variety serve as instructive examples, providing a robust foundation for fine-tuning smaller student models. Experiments across varied scenarios reveal that the teacher-student scheme with DRI notably improves the response abilities of smaller models, even outperforming the teacher model in some cases. The dataset and codes are available.",
    "Self-Contrast: Better Reflection Through Inconsistent Solving Perspectives": "The reflection capacity of Large Language Model (LLM) has garnered extensive attention. A post-hoc prompting strategy, e.g., reflection and self-refine, refines LLM's response based on self-evaluated or external feedback. However, recent research indicates without external feedback, LLM's intrinsic reflection is unstable. Our investigation unveils that the key bottleneck is the quality of the self-evaluated feedback. We find LLMs often exhibit overconfidence or high randomness when self-evaluate, offering stubborn or inconsistent feedback, which causes poor reflection. To remedy this, we advocate Self-Contrast: It adaptively explores diverse solving perspectives tailored to the request, contrasts the differences, and summarizes these discrepancies into a checklist which could be used to re-examine and eliminate discrepancies. Our method provides LLM with diverse perspectives to alleviate stubborn biases. Moreover, their discrepancies indicate potential errors or inherent uncertainties that LLM often overlooks. Reflecting upon these can prompt more accurate and stable reflection. Experiments conducted on a series of reasoning and translation tasks with different LLMs serve to underscore the effectiveness and generality of our strategy.",
    "Self-Distillation Bridges Distribution Gap in Language Model Fine-Tuning": "The surge in Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, but fine-tuning them for specific tasks often encounters challenges in balancing performance and preserving general instruction-following abilities. In this paper, we posit that the distribution gap between task datasets and the LLMs serves as the primary underlying cause. To address the problem, we introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a novel approach that bridges the distribution gap by guiding fine-tuning with a distilled dataset generated by the model itself to match its original distribution. Experimental results on the Llama-2-chat model across various benchmarks demonstrate that SDFT effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while achieving comparable or superior performance on downstream tasks compared to the vanilla fine-tuning. Moreover, SDFT demonstrates the potential to maintain the helpfulness and safety alignment of LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/sdft.",
    "Self-Evolving GPT: A Lifelong Autonomous Experiential Learner": "To improve the performance of large language models (LLMs), researchers have explored providing LLMs with textual task-solving experience via prompts. However, they rely on manual efforts to acquire and apply such experience for each task, which is not feasible for the growing demand for LLMs and the variety of user questions. To address this issue, we design a lifelong autonomous experiential learning framework based on LLMs to explore whether LLMs can imitate human ability for learning and utilizing experience. It autonomously learns and accumulates experience through experience transfer and induction, categorizing the types of input questions to select which accumulated experience to employ for them. Experimental results on six widely used NLP datasets show that our framework performs reliably in each intermediate step and effectively improves the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. This validates the feasibility of using LLMs to mimic human experiential learning and application capabilities. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the behavior of our framework at each step.",
    "Self-Para-Consistency: Improving Reasoning Tasks at Low Cost for Large Language Models": "Recently, the self-consistency decoding strategy has shown the ability to improve performance for complex reasoning tasks with large language models (LLMs). However, the costs may be high because the sampling process of the strategy generates some low-probability text, resulting in low-quality reasoning paths. As a consequence, it requires a relatively large sampling number to obtain good aggregation performance.  In this paper, we propose an alternative strategy, self-para-consistency. It first generates multiple paraphrases for each test question, then generates reasoning paths for the original and all the paraphrased questions based on greedy decoding, and finally selects the most consistent answer. Since all the candidate paths have relatively high probabilities, the sampling number could be much smaller than the self-consistency strategy. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in reducing the sampling number.",
    "Self-Specialization: Uncovering Latent Expertise within Large Language Models": "Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of self-alignment in which a large language model is aligned to follow general instructions using instructional data generated from the model itself starting from a handful of human-written seeds. Instead of general alignment, in this work, we focus on self-alignment for expert domain specialization (e.g., biomedicine, finance). As a preliminary, we quantitatively show the marginal effect that generic instruction-following training has on downstream expert domains' performance. To remedy this, we propose self-specialization - allowing for effective model specialization while achieving cross-task generalization by leveraging only a few labeled seeds. Self-specialization offers a data- and parameter-efficient way of “carving out” an expert model out of a generalist pre-trained LLM. Exploring a variety of popular open large models as a base for specialization, our experimental results in both biomedical and financial domains show that our self-specialized models outperform their base models by a large margin, and even larger models that are generally instruction-tuned or that have been adapted to the target domain by other means.",
    "Self-Supervised Position Debiasing for Large Language Models": "Fine-tuning has been demonstrated to be an effective method to improve the domain performance of large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs might fit the dataset bias and shortcuts for prediction, leading to poor generation performance. Previous works have proven that LLMs are prone to exhibit position bias, i.e., leveraging information positioned at the beginning or end, or specific positional cues within the input. Existing debiasing methods for LLMs require external bias knowledge or annotated non-biased samples, which is lacking for position debiasing and impractical in reality. In this work, we propose a self-supervised position debiasing (SOD) framework to mitigate position bias for LLMs. SOD leverages unsupervised responses from pre-trained LLMs for debiasing without relying on any external knowledge. To improve the quality of unsupervised responses, we propose an objective alignment (OAM) module to prune these responses. Experiments on eight datasets and five tasks show that SOD consistently outperforms existing methods in mitigating three types of position biases. Besides, SOD achieves this by sacrificing only a small performance on biased samples, which is general and effective. To facilitate the reproducibility of the results, we share the code of all methods and datasets on https://github.com/LZKSKY/SOD.",
    "Self-Training with Direct Preference Optimization Improves Chain-of-Thought Reasoning": "Teaching small-scale language models to perform math reasoning is a valuable yet challenging task. Besides obtaining labeled data from human experts, one of the most common ways to collect high-quality data is by sampling from a larger and more powerful language model. Although previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method, such a knowledge distillation paradigm can be costly and unstable, especially considering that many large language models, such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), are closed-source, proprietary, and their behaviors are unpredictable. In this work, to avoid relying on outputs from large models, we demonstrate that the reasoning abilities of small-scale language models can be enhanced through self-training, which involves training models with their own outputs. We also show that the conventional self-training can be further augmented by an alignment algorithm called Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). We empirically found that models trained with the DPO objective are capable of making better generations that largely benefit multi-turn self-training. The experimental results show our models outperform the existing models with comparable sizes on the GSM8K benchmark with minimal resource requirements.",
    "Self-Training with Pseudo-Label Scorer for Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction": "Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction (ASQP) aims to predict all quads (aspect term, aspect category, opinion term, sentiment polarity) for a given review, which is the most representative and challenging task in aspect-based sentiment analysis. A key challenge in the ASQP task is the scarcity of labeled data, which limits the performance of existing methods. To tackle this issue, we propose a self-training framework with a pseudo-label scorer, wherein a scorer assesses the match between reviews and their pseudo-labels, aiming to filter out mismatches and thereby enhance the effectiveness of self-training. We highlight two critical aspects to ensure the scorer's effectiveness and reliability: the quality of the training dataset and its model architecture. To this end, we create a human-annotated comparison dataset and train a generative model on it using ranking-based objectives. Extensive experiments on public ASQP datasets reveal that using our scorer can greatly and consistently improve the effectiveness of self-training. Moreover, we explore the possibility of replacing humans with large language models for comparison dataset annotation, and experiments demonstrate its feasibility.",
    "Semantic are Beacons: A Semantic Perspective for Unveiling Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in Knowledge Learning": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods enable efficient adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) to various downstream applications. However, the effectiveness of the PEFT diminishes notably when downstream tasks require accurate learning of factual knowledge. In this paper, we adopt a semantic perspective to investigate this phenomenon, uncovering the reasons behind PEFT's limitations in knowledge learning tasks. Our findings reveal that: (1) PEFT presents a notable risk of pushing the model away from the intended knowledge target; (2) multiple knowledge interfere with each other, and such interference suppresses the learning and expression of knowledge features. Based on these insights, we introduce a data filtering strategy to exclude data that is detrimental to knowledge learning and a re-weighted learning strategy to make the model attentive to semantic distance during knowledge learning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on open-source large language models, further validate the semantic challenge in PEFT, thus paving the way for future research.",
    "Semantic Graphs for Syntactic Simplification: A Revisit from the Age of LLM": "Symbolic sentence meaning representations, such as AMR (Abstract Meaning Representation) provide expressive and structured semantic graphs that act as intermediates that simplify downstream NLP tasks. However, the instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) offers a shortcut to effectively solve NLP tasks, questioning the utility of semantic graphs. Meanwhile, recent work has also shown the difficulty of using meaning representations merely as a helpful auxiliary for LLMs. We revisit the position of semantic graphs in syntactic simplification, the task of simplifying sentence structures while preserving their meaning, which requires semantic understanding, and evaluate it on a new complex and natural dataset. The AMR-based method that we propose, AMRS3, demonstrates that state-of-the-art meaning representations can lead to easy-to-implement simplification methods with competitive performance and unique advantages in cost, interpretability, and generalization. With AMRS3 as an anchor, we discover that syntactic simplification is a task where semantic graphs are helpful in LLM prompting. We propose AMRCoC prompting that guides LLMs to emulate graph algorithms for explicit symbolic reasoning on AMR graphs, and show its potential for improving LLM on semantic-centered tasks like syntactic simplification.",
    "Semantic Skill Grounding for Embodied Instruction-Following in Cross-Domain Environments": "In embodied instruction-following (EIF), the integration of pretrained language models (LMs) as task planners emerges as a significant branch, where tasks are planned at the skill level by prompting LMs with pretrained skills and user instructions. However, grounding these pretrained skills in different domains remains challenging due to their intricate entanglement with the domain-specific knowledge. To address this challenge, we present a semantic skill grounding (SemGro) framework that leverages the hierarchical nature of semantic skills. SemGro recognizes the broad spectrum of these skills, ranging from short-horizon low-semantic skills that are universally applicable across domains to long-horizon rich-semantic skills that are highly specialized and tailored for particular domains. The framework employs an iterative skill decomposition approach, starting from the higher levels of semantic skill hierarchy and then moving downwards, so as to ground each planned skill to an executable level within the target domain. To do so, we use the reasoning capabilities of LMs for composing and decomposing semantic skills, as well as their multi-modal extension for assessing the skill feasibility in the target domain. Our experiments in the VirtualHome benchmark show the efficacy of SemGro in 300 cross-domain EIF scenarios.",
    "Semantic Word and Sentence Embeddings Compression using Discrete Wavelet Transform": "Wavelet transforms, a powerful mathematical tool, have been widely used in different domains, including Signal and Image processing, to unravel intricate patterns, enhance data representation, and extract meaningful features from data. Tangible results from their application suggest that Wavelet transforms can be applied to NLP capturing a variety of linguistic and semantic properties. In this paper, we empirically leverage the application of Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) to word and sentence embeddings. We aim to showcase the capabilities of DWT in analyzing embedding representations at different levels of resolution and compressing them while maintaining their overall quality. We assess the effectiveness of DWT embeddings on semantic similarity tasks to show how DWT can be used to consolidate important semantic information in an embedding vector. We show the efficacy of the proposed paradigm using different embedding models, including large language models, on downstream tasks. Our results show that DWT can reduce the dimensionality of embeddings by 50-93% with almost no change in performance for semantic similarity tasks, while achieving superior accuracy in most downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for applying DWT to improve NLP applications.",
    "Semantics or spelling? Probing contextual word embeddings with orthographic noise": "Pretrained language model (PLM) hidden states are frequently employed as contextual word embeddings (CWE): high-dimensional representations that encode semantic information given linguistic context. Across many areas of computational linguistics research, similarity between CWEs is interpreted as semantic similarity. However, it remains unclear exactly what information is encoded in PLM hidden states. We investigate this practice by probing PLM representations using minimal orthographic noise. We expect that if CWEs primarily encode semantic information, a single character swap in the input word will not drastically affect the resulting representation, given sufficient linguistic context. Surprisingly, we find that CWEs generated by popular PLMs are highly sensitive to noise in input data, and that this sensitivity is related to subword tokenization: the fewer tokens used to represent a word at input, the more sensitive its corresponding CWE. This suggests that CWEs capture information unrelated to word-level meaning and can be manipulated through trivial modifications of input data. We conclude that these PLM-derived CWEs may not be reliable semantic proxies, and that caution is warranted when interpreting representational similarity.",
    "Semiparametric Token-Sequence Co-Supervision": "In this work, we introduce a semiparametric token-sequence co-supervision training method. It trains a language model by simultaneously leveraging supervision from the traditional next token prediction loss which is calculated over the parametric token embedding space and the next sequence prediction loss which is calculated over the nonparametric sequence embedding space. The nonparametric sequence embedding space is constructed by a separate language model tasked to condense an input text into a single representative embedding. Our experiments demonstrate that a model trained via both supervisions consistently surpasses models trained via each supervision independently. Analysis suggests that this co-supervision encourages a broader generalization capability across the model. Especially, the robustness of parametric token space which is established during the pretraining step tends to effectively enhance the stability of nonparametric sequence embedding space, a new space established by another language model.",
    "Set the Clock: Temporal Alignment of Pretrained Language Models": "Language models (LMs) are trained on web text originating from many points in time and, in general, without any explicit temporal grounding. This work investigates the temporal chaos of pretrained LMs and explores various methods to align their internal knowledge to a target time, which we call “temporal alignment.” To do this, we first automatically construct a dataset containing 20K time-sensitive questions and their answers for each year from 2000 to 2023. Based on this dataset, we empirically show that pretrained LMs (e.g., LLaMa2), despite having a recent pretraining cutoff (e.g., 2022), mostly answer questions using earlier knowledge (e.g., in 2019). We then develop several methods, from prompting to finetuning, to align LMs to use their most recent knowledge when answering questions, and investigate various factors in this alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that aligning LLaMa2 to the year 2022 can enhance its performance by up to 62% according to that year's answers. This improvement occurs even without explicitly mentioning time information, indicating the possibility of aligning models' internal sense of time after pretraining. Finally, we find that alignment to a historical time is also possible, with up to 2.8× the performance of the unaligned LM in 2010 if finetuning models to that year. These findings hint at the sophistication of LMs' internal knowledge organization and the necessity of tuning them properly.",
    "Shifting Attention to Relevance: Towards the Predictive Uncertainty Quantification of Free-Form Large Language Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising results in language generation and instruction following but frequently “hallucinate”, making their outputs less reliable. Despite Uncertainty Quantification's (UQ) potential solutions, implementing it accurately within LLMs is challenging. Our research introduces a simple heuristic: not all tokens in auto-regressive LLM text equally represent the underlying meaning, as “linguistic redundancy” often allows a few keywords to convey the essence of long sentences. However, current methods underestimate this inequality when assessing uncertainty, causing tokens with limited semantics to be equally or excessively weighted in UQ. To correct this, we propose Shifting Attention to more Relevant (SAR) components at both token- and sentence-levels for better UQ. We conduct extensive experiments involving a range of popular “off-the-shelf” LLMs, such as Vicuna, WizardLM, and LLaMA-2-chat, with model sizes extending up to 33B parameters. We evaluate various free-form question-answering tasks, encompassing domains such as reading comprehension, science Q&A, and medical Q&A. Our experimental results, coupled with a comprehensive demographic analysis, demonstrate the superior performance of SAR. The code is available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/SAR.",
    "Shimo Lab at “Discharge Me!”: Discharge Summarization by Prompt-Driven Concatenation of Electronic Health Record Sections": "In this paper, we present our approach to the shared task “Discharge Me!” at the BioNLP Workshop 2024. The primary goal of this task is to reduce the time and effort clinicians spend on writing detailed notes in the electronic health record (EHR). Participants develop a pipeline to generate the “Brief Hospital Course” and “Discharge Instructions” sections from the EHR. Our approach involves a first step of extracting the relevant sections from the EHR. We then add explanatory prompts to these sections and concatenate them with separate tokens to create the input text. To train a text generation model, we perform LoRA fine-tuning on the ClinicalT5-large model. On the final test data, our approach achieved a ROUGE-1 score of 0.394, which is comparable to the top solutions.",
    "SIBO: A Simple Booster for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning": "Fine-tuning all parameters of large language models (LLMs) necessitates substantial computational power and extended time. Latest advancements in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapter tuning and LoRA, allow for adjustments to only a minor fraction of the parameters of these LLMs. Concurrently, it has been noted that the issue of over-smoothing diminishes the effectiveness of these Transformer-based LLMs, resulting in suboptimal performances in downstream tasks. In this paper, we present SIBO, which is a SImple BOoster to enhance PEFT, by injecting an initial residual. SIBO is straightforward and readily extensible to a range of state-of-the-art PEFT techniques to alleviate over-smoothing and enhance performance. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SIBO significantly enhances the performance of various strong baselines, achieving up to 15.7% and 23.5% improvement over existing PEFT methods on the arithmetic and common-sense reasoning tasks, respectively.",
    "SIFiD: Reassess Summary Factual Inconsistency Detection with LLM": "Ensuring factual consistency between the summary and the original document is paramount in summarization tasks. Consequently, considerable effort has been dedicated to detecting inconsistencies. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies have begun to leverage their advanced language understanding capabilities for inconsistency detection. However, early attempts have shown that LLMs underperform traditional models due to their limited ability to follow instructions and the absence of an effective detection methodology. In this study, we reassess summary inconsistency detection with LLMs, comparing the performances of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. To advance research in LLM-based inconsistency detection, we propose SIFiD (Summary Inconsistency Detection with Filtered Document) that identifies key sentences within documents by either employing natural language inference or measuring semantic similarity between summaries and documents.",
    "Silent Signals, Loud Impact: LLMs for Word-Sense Disambiguation of Coded Dog Whistles": "Warning: This paper contains content that may be upsetting or offensive to some readers. A dog whistle is a form of coded communication that carries a secondary meaning to specific audiences and is often weaponized for racial and socioeconomic discrimination. Dog whistling historically originated from United States politics, but in recent years has taken root in social media as a means of evading hate speech detection systems and maintaining plausible deniability. In this paper, we present an approach for word-sense disambiguation of dog whistles from standard speech using Large Language Models (LLMs), and leverage this technique to create a dataset of 16,550 high-confidence coded examples of dog whistles used in formal and informal communication.

    "Simplifying Translations for Children: Iterative Simplification Considering Age of Acquisition with LLMs": "In recent years, neural machine translation (NMT) has been widely used in everyday life. However, the current NMT lacks a mechanism to adjust the difficulty level of translations to match the user's language level. Additionally, due to the bias in the training data for NMT, translations of simple source sentences are often produced with complex words. In particular, this could pose a problem for children, who may not be able to understand the meaning of the translations correctly. In this study, we propose a method that replaces words with high Age of Acquisitions (AoA) in translations with simpler words to match the translations to the user's level. We achieve this by using large language models (LLMs), providing a triple of a source sentence, a translation, and a target word to be replaced. We create a benchmark dataset using back-translation on Simple English Wikipedia. The experimental results obtained from the dataset show that our method effectively replaces high-AoA words with lower-AoA words and, moreover, can iteratively replace most of the high-AoA words while still maintaining high BLEU and COMET scores.",
    "Simul-LLM: A Framework for Exploring High-Quality Simultaneous Translation with Large Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters and pretrained on massive amounts of data are now capable of near or better than state-of-the-art performance in a variety of downstream natural language processing tasks. Neural machine translation (NMT) is one such task that LLMs have been applied to with great success. However, little research has focused on applying LLMs to the more difficult subset of NMT called simultaneous translation (SimulMT), where translation begins before the entire source context is available to the model. In this paper, we address key challenges facing LLMs fine-tuned for SimulMT, validate classical SimulMT concepts and practices in the context of LLMs, explore adapting LLMs that are fine-tuned for NMT to the task of SimulMT, and introduce Simul-LLM1, the first open-source fine-tuning and evaluation pipeline development framework for LLMs focused on SimulMT.",
    "Simulated Misinformation Susceptibility (SMISTS): Enhancing Misinformation Research with Large Language Model Simulations": "Psychological inoculation, a strategy to build resistance against persuasive misinformation, has been shown to reduce its spread and adverse effects. Although these inoculations are effective, the design and optimization of them typically require substantial financial and human resources. To address these challenges, this work introduces Simulated Misinformation Susceptibility Test (SMIST), leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate participant responses in misinformation studies. SMIST employs a life experience-driven simulation methodology, which accounts for various aspects of participants' backgrounds, to mitigate common issues of caricatures and stereotypes in LLM simulations and enhance response diversity. Our extensive experimentation demonstrates that SMIST, utilizing GPT-4 as the backend model, yields results that align closely with those obtained from human-subject studies in misinformation susceptibility. This alignment suggests that LLMs can effectively serve as proxies in evaluating the impact of psychological inoculations. Further, SMIST can be applied to emerging and anticipated misinformation scenarios without harming human participants, thereby expanding the scope of misinformation research.",
    "Simulating Expert Discussions with Multi-agent for Enhanced Scientific Problem Solving": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential across various domains, yet their application in addressing complex scientific problems remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a novel methodology to augment the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs by assigning them roles as domain-specific experts. By simulating a panel of experts, each LLM is tasked with delivering professional and cautious responses to scientific inquiries. Our approach involves querying multiple LLMs and assessing the consistency of their responses. High agreement among the LLMs suggests greater confidence in the proposed solution, whereas discrepancies prompt a collaborative discussion among the LLMs to reach a consensus. This method emulates real-world scientific problem-solving processes, fostering a more reliable and robust mechanism for LLMs to tackle scientific questions. Our experimental results show that assigning roles to multiple LLMs as domain-specific experts significantly improves their accuracy and reliability in solving scientific problems. This framework has the potential to advance the application of AI in scientific research, enhancing its effectiveness and trustworthiness.",
    "SINAI at BioLaySumm: Self-Play Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models for Biomedical Lay Summarisation": "An effective disclosure of scientific knowledge and advancements to the general public is often hindered by the complexity of the technical language used in research which often results very difficult, if not impossible, for non-experts to understand. In this paper we present the approach developed by the SINAI team as the result of our participation in BioLaySumm shared task hosted by the BioNLP workshop at ACL 2024. Our approach stems from the experimentation we performed in order to test the ability of state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models, namely GPT 3.5, GPT 4 and Llama-3, to tackle this task in a few-shot manner. In order to improve this baseline, we opted for fine-tuning Llama-3 by applying parameter-efficient methodologies. The best performing system which resulted from applying self-play fine tuning method which allows the model to improve while learning to distinguish between its own generations from the previous step from the gold standard summaries. This approach achieved 0.4205 ROUGE-1 score and 0.8583 BERTScore.",
    "SirLLM: Streaming Infinite Retentive LLM": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent in various domains, their ability to process inputs of any length and maintain a degree of memory becomes essential. However, the one-off input of overly long texts is limited, as studies have shown that when input lengths exceed the LLMs' pre-trained text length, there is a dramatic decline in text generation capabilities. Moreover, simply extending the length of pre-training texts is impractical due to the difficulty in obtaining long text data and the substantial memory consumption costs this would entail for LLMs. Recent efforts have employed streaming inputs to alleviate the pressure of excessively long text inputs, but this approach can significantly impair the model's long-term memory capabilities.  Motivated by this challenge, we introduce Streaming Infinite Retentive LLM (SirLLM), which allows LLMs to maintain longer memory during infinite-length dialogues without the need for fine-tuning. SirLLM utilizes the Token Entropy metric and a memory decay mechanism to filter key phrases, endowing LLMs with both long-lasting and flexible memory. We designed three distinct tasks and constructed three datasets to measure the effectiveness of SirLLM from various angles: (1) DailyDialog; (2) Grocery Shopping; (3) Rock-Paper-Scissors. Our experimental results robustly demonstrate that SirLLM can achieve stable and significant improvements across different LLMs and tasks, compellingly proving its effectiveness. When having a coversation, A sir could forget himself, but SirLLM never does! Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Zoeyyao27/SirLLM",
    "Sketch-Guided Constrained Decoding for Boosting Blackbox Large Language Models without Logit Access": "Constrained decoding, a technique for enforcing constraints on language model outputs, offers a way to control text generation without retraining or architectural modifications. Its application is, however, typically restricted to models that give users access to next-token distributions (usually via softmax logits), which poses a limitation with blackbox large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces sketch-guided constrained decoding (SketchGCD), a novel approach to constrained decoding for blackbox LLMs, which operates without access to the logits of the blackbox LLM. SketchGCD utilizes a locally hosted auxiliary model to refine the output of an unconstrained blackbox LLM, effectively treating this initial output as a “sketch” for further elaboration. This approach is complementary to traditional logit-based techniques and enables the application of constrained decoding in settings where full model transparency is unavailable. We demonstrate the efficacy of SketchGCD through experiments in closed information extraction and constituency parsing, showing how it enhances the utility and flexibility of blackbox LLMs for complex NLP tasks.",
    "Skin-in-the-Game: Decision Making via Multi-Stakeholder Alignment in LLMs": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in tasks such as summarization, arithmetic reasoning, and question answering. However, they encounter significant challenges in the domain of moral reasoning and ethical decision-making, especially in complex scenarios with multiple stakeholders. This paper introduces the Skin-in-the-Game (SKIG) framework, aimed at enhancing moral reasoning in LLMs by exploring decisions' consequences from multiple stakeholder perspectives. Central to SKIG's mechanism is simulating accountability for actions, which, alongside empathy exercises and risk assessment, is pivotal to its effectiveness. We validate SKIG's performance across various moral reasoning benchmarks with proprietary and opensource LLMs, and investigate its crucial components through extensive ablation analyses. The code and related content can be found in: skin-in-the-game.github.io",
    "SLIDE: A Framework Integrating Small and Large Language Models for Open-Domain Dialogues Evaluation": "The long-standing one-to-many problem of gold standard responses in open-domain dialogue systems presents challenges for automatic evaluation metrics. Though prior works have demonstrated some success by applying powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), existing approaches still struggle with the one-to-many problem, and exhibit subpar performance in domain-specific scenarios. We assume the commonsense reasoning biases within LLMs may hinder their performance in domain-specific evaluations. To address both issues, we propose a novel framework SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), that leverages both a small, specialised model (SLM), and LLMs for the evaluation of open domain dialogues. Our approach introduces several techniques: (1) Contrastive learning to differentiate between robust and non-robust response embeddings; (2) A novel metric for semantic sensitivity that combines embedding cosine distances with similarity learned through neural networks, and (3) A strategy for incorporating the evaluation results from both the SLM and LLMs. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both the classification and evaluation tasks, and additionally the SLIDE evaluator exhibits better correlation with human judgements.",
    "Small But Funny: A Feedback-Driven Approach to Humor Distillation": "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought to light promising language generation capabilities, particularly in performing tasks like complex reasoning and creative writing. Consequently, distillation through imitation of teacher responses has emerged as a popular technique to transfer knowledge from LLMs to more accessible, Small Language Models (SLMs). While this works well for simpler tasks, there is a substantial performance gap on tasks requiring intricate language comprehension and creativity, such as humor generation. We hypothesize that this gap may stem from the fact that creative tasks might be hard to learn by imitation alone and explore whether an approach, involving supplementary guidance from the teacher could yield higher performance. To address this, we study the effect of assigning a dual role to the LLM - as a “teacher” generating data, as well as a “critic” evaluating the student's performance. Our experiments on humor generation reveal that the incorporation of feedback significantly narrows the performance gap between SLMs and their larger counterparts compared to merely relying on imitation. As a result, our research highlights the potential of using feedback as an additional dimension to data when transferring complex language abilities via distillation.",
    "Small Language Models Need Strong Verifiers to Self-Correct Reasoning": "Self-correction has emerged as a promising solution to boost the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), where LLMs refine their solutions using self-generated critiques that pinpoint the errors. This work explores whether small (≤13B) language models (LMs) have the ability of self-correction on reasoning tasks with minimal inputs from stronger LMs. We propose a novel pipeline that prompts smaller LMs to collect self-correction data that supports the training of self-refinement abilities. First, we leverage correct solutions to guide the model in critiquing their incorrect responses. Second, the generated critiques, after filtering, are used for supervised fine-tuning of the self-correcting reasoner through solution refinement. Our experimental results show improved self-correction abilities of two models on five datasets spanning math and commonsense reasoning, with notable performance gains when paired with a strong GPT-4-based verifier, though limitations are identified when using a weak self-verifier for determining when to correct.",
    "Small Models are Valuable Plug-ins for Large Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 are powerful but their weights are often publicly unavailable and their immense sizes make the models difficult to be tuned with common hardware. As a result, effectively tuning these models with large-scale supervised data can be challenging. As an alternative, In-Context Learning (ICL) can only use a small number of supervised examples due to context length limits. In this paper, we propose Super In-Context Learning (SuperICL) which allows black-box LLMs to work with locally fine-tuned smaller models, resulting in superior performance on supervised tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that SuperICL can improve performance beyond state-of-the-art fine-tuned models while addressing the instability problem of in-context learning.",
    "Small Models, Big Insights: Leveraging Slim Proxy Models to Decide When and What to Retrieve for LLMs": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) and search engines represents a significant evolution in knowledge acquisition methodologies. However, determining the knowledge that an LLM already possesses and the knowledge that requires the help of a search engine remains an unresolved issue. Most existing methods solve this problem through the results of preliminary answers or reasoning done by the LLM itself, but this incurs excessively high computational costs. This paper introduces a novel collaborative approach, namely SlimPLM, that detects missing knowledge in LLMs with a slim proxy model, to enhance the LLM's knowledge acquisition process. We employ a proxy model which has far fewer parameters, and take its answers as heuristic answers. Heuristic answers are then utilized to predict the knowledge required to answer the user question, as well as the known and unknown knowledge within the LLM. We only conduct retrieval for the missing knowledge in questions that the LLM does not know. Extensive experimental results on five datasets with two LLMs demonstrate a notable improvement in the end-to-end performance of LLMs in question-answering tasks, achieving or surpassing current state-of-the-art models with lower LLM inference costs.",
    "Smaller Language Models are capable of selecting Instruction-Tuning Training Data for Larger Language Models": "Instruction-tuning language models has become a crucial step in aligning them for general use. Typically, this process involves extensive training on large datasets, incurring high training costs. In this paper, we introduce a novel training data selection based on the learning percentage of the samples. We assert that current language models possess the capability to autonomously select high-quality training data, leading to comparable or improved performance compared to training on the entire dataset. Our experiments span different-sized models, revealing that this characteristic holds for models ranging from 1B (small) to 13B (large) in size. Moreover, we demonstrate an interesting finding that the data hardness transfers across model sizes, and a smaller 350M model can effectively curate high-quality training data with hard samples for a larger 13B model, resulting in an equally or superior instruction-tuned model compared to training on the complete dataset. Utilizing open-sourced OPT and Llama-2 models up to 13B in size, two publicly available instruction-tuning training datasets and evaluated by both automatic metrics & humans, our paper introduces a novel approach to training data selection, showcasing a more efficient alternative.",
    "SMART: Submodular Data Mixture Strategy for Instruction Tuning": "Instruction Tuning involves finetuning a language model on a collection of instruction-formatted datasets in order to enhance the generalizability of the model to unseen tasks. Studies have shown the importance of balancing different task proportions during finetuning, but finding the right balance remains challenging. Unfortunately, there's currently no systematic method beyond manual tuning or relying on practitioners' intuition. In this paper, we introduce SMART (Submodular data Mixture strAtegy for instRuction Tuning) — a novel data mixture strategy which makes use of a submodular function to assign importance scores to tasks which are then used to determine the mixture weights. Given a fine-tuning budget, SMART redistributes the budget among tasks and selects non-redundant samples from each task. Experimental results demonstrate that SMART significantly outperforms traditional methods such as examples proportional mixing and equal mixing. Furthermore, SMART facilitates the creation of data mixtures based on a few representative subsets of tasks alone and through task pruning analysis, we reveal that in a limited budget setting, allocating budget among a subset of representative tasks yields superior performance compared to distributing the budget among all tasks. The code for reproducing our results is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/SMART.",
    "SMASH at StanceEval 2024: Prompt Engineering LLMs for Arabic Stance Detection": "This paper presents our submission for the Stance Detection in Arabic Language (StanceEval) 2024 shared task conducted by Team SMASH of the University of Edinburgh. We evaluated the performance of various BERT-based and large language models (LLMs). MARBERT demonstrates superior performance among the BERT-based models, achieving F1 and macro-F1 scores of 0.570 and 0.770, respectively. In contrast, the Command-R model outperforms all models with the highest overall F1 score of 0.661 and macro F1 score of 0.820.",
    "SMM4H'24 Task6 : Extracting Self-Reported Age with LLM and BERTweet: Fine-Grained Approaches for Social Media Text": "The paper presents two distinct approaches to Task 6 of the SMM4H'24 workshop: extracting self-reported exact age information from social media posts across platforms. This research task focuses on developing methods for automatically extracting self-reported ages from posts on two prominent social media platforms: Twitter (now X) and Reddit. The work leverages two ways, one Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 Large Language Model (LLM) and another pre-trained language model BERTweet, to achieve robust and generalizable age classification, surpassing limitations of existing methods that rely on predefined age groups. The proposed models aim to advance the automatic extraction of self-reported exact ages from social media posts, enabling more nuanced analyses and insights into user demographics across different platforms.",
    "SocialBench: Sociality Evaluation of Role-Playing Conversational Agents": "Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of various AI conversational agents, including role-playing agents that mimic diverse characters and human behaviors. While prior research has predominantly focused on enhancing the conversational capability, role-specific knowledge and style of these agents, there has been a noticeable gap in assessing their social intelligence. In this paper, we introduce SocialBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the sociality of role-playing agents at both individual and group levels of social interactions. SocialBench is constructed from various sources and covers a wide range of 500 characters and over 6,000 question prompts and 30,800 multi-turn role-playing utterances. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on this benchmark using mainstream LLMs. We find that agents excelling at the individual level do not necessarily demonstrate proficiency at the group level. Experimental results on SocialBench confirm its significance as a testbed for assessing the social interaction of role-playing agents. The benchmark is publicly accessible at https://github.com/X-PLUG/RoleInteract.",
    "Sociodemographic Bias in Language Models: A Survey and Forward Path": "Sociodemographic bias in language models (LMs) has the potential for harm when deployed in real-world settings. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the past decade of research on sociodemographic bias in LMs, organized into a typology that facilitates examining the different aims: types of bias, quantifying bias, and debiasing techniques. We track the evolution of the latter two questions, then identify current trends and their limitations, as well as emerging techniques. To guide future research towards more effective and reliable solutions, and to help authors situate their work within this broad landscape, we conclude with a checklist of open questions.",
    "Soft Knowledge Prompt: Help External Knowledge Become a Better Teacher to Instruct LLM in Knowledge-based VQA": "LLM has achieved impressive performance on multi-modal tasks, which have received ever-increasing research attention. Recent research focuses on improving prediction performance and reliability (e.g., addressing the hallucination problem). They often prepend relevant external knowledge to the input text as an extra prompt. However, these methods would be affected by the noise in the knowledge and the context length limitation of LLM. In our work, we focus on making better use of external knowledge and propose a method to actively extract valuable information in the knowledge to produce the latent vector as a soft prompt, which is then fused with the image embedding to form a knowledge-enhanced context to instruct LLM. The experimental results on knowledge-based VQA benchmarks show that the proposed method enjoys better utilization of external knowledge and helps the model achieve better performance.",
    "Soft Self-Consistency Improves Language Model Agents": "Generations from large language models (LLMs) can be improved by sampling and scoring multiple solutions to select a final answer. Current “sample and select” methods such as self-consistency (SC; Wang et al., 2023) rely on majority voting to score answers. However, when tasks have many distinct and valid answers, selection by voting requires a large number of samples. This makes SC prohibitively expensive for interactive tasks that involve generating multiple actions (answers) sequentially. After establishing that majority voting fails to provide consistent gains on such tasks, we demonstrate how to increase success rates by softening the scoring criterion. We introduce Soft Self-Consistency (SOFT-SC), which replaces SC's discontinuous scoring with a continuous score computed from model likelihoods, allowing for selection even when actions are sparsely distributed. SOFT-SC improves both performance and efficiency on long-horizon interactive tasks, requiring half as many samples as SC for comparable or better performance. For a fixed number of samples, SOFT-SC leads to a 1.3% increase over SC in absolute success rate on writing bash programs, a 6.6% increase on online shopping (WebShop), and a 4.7% increase for an interactive household game (ALFWorld). Finally, we show that SOFT-SC can be applied to both open-source and black-box models.",
    "SoftDedup: an Efficient Data Reweighting Method for Speeding Up Language Model Pre-training": "The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) is often hindered by duplicated data in their extensive pre-training datasets. Current approaches primarily focus on detecting and removing duplicates, which risks the loss of valuable information and neglects the varying degrees of duplication. To address this, we propose a soft deduplication method that maintains dataset integrity while selectively reducing the sampling weight of data with high commonness. Central to our approach is the concept of data commonness, a metric we introduce to quantify the degree of duplication by measuring the occurrence probabilities of samples using an n-gram model. Empirical analysis shows that this method significantly improves training efficiency, achieving comparable perplexity scores with at least a 26% reduction in required training steps. Additionally, it enhances average few-shot downstream accuracy by 1.77% when trained for an equivalent duration. Importantly, this approach consistently improves performance, even on rigorously deduplicated datasets, indicating its potential to complement existing methods and become a standard pre-training process for LLMs.",
    "SoMeLVLM: A Large Vision Language Model for Social Media Processing": "The growth of social media, characterized by its multimodal nature, has led to the emergence of diverse phenomena and challenges, which calls for an effective approach to uniformly solve automated tasks. The powerful Large Vision Language Models make it possible to handle a variety of tasks simultaneously, but even with carefully designed prompting methods, the general domain models often fall short in aligning with the unique speaking style and context of social media tasks. In this paper, we introduce a Large Vision Language Model for Social Media Processing (SoMeLVLM), which is a cognitive framework equipped with five key capabilities including knowledge & comprehension, application, analysis, evaluation, and creation. SoMeLVLM is designed to understand and generate realistic social media behavior. We have developed a 654k multimodal social media instruction-tuning dataset to support our cognitive framework and fine-tune our model. Our experiments demonstrate that SoMeLVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple social media tasks. Further analysis shows its significant advantages over baselines in terms of cognitive abilities.",
    "SOTOPIA-π: Interactive Learning of Socially Intelligent Language Agents": "Humans learn social skills through both imitation and social interaction. This social learning process is largely understudied by existing research on building language agents. Motivated by this gap, we propose an interactive learning method, SOTOPIA-π, improving the social intelligence of language agents. This method leverages behavior cloning and self-reinforcement training on filtered social interaction data according to large language model (LLM) ratings. We show that our training method allows a 7B LLM to reach the social goal completion ability of an expert model (GPT-4-based agent), while improving the safety of language agents and maintaining general QA ability on the MMLU benchmark. We also find that this training paradigm uncovers some difficulties in LLM-based evaluation of social intelligence: LLM-based evaluators overestimate the abilities of the language agents trained specifically for social interaction.",
    "Sowing the Wind, Reaping the Whirlwind: The Impact of Editing Language Models": "Warning: This paper contains several unethical and sensitive statements. In the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence, the concept of 'Red-Teaming' or 'Jailbreaking' large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a crucial area of study. This approach is especially significant in terms of assessing and enhancing the safety and robustness of these models. This paper investigates the intricate consequences of such modifications through model editing, uncovering a complex relationship between enhancing model accuracy and preserving its ethical integrity. Our in-depth analysis reveals a striking paradox: while injecting accurate information is crucial for model reliability, it can paradoxically destabilize the model's foundational framework, resulting in unpredictable and potentially unsafe behaviors. Additionally, we propose a benchmark dataset NICHEHAZARDQA to investigate this unsafe behavior both within the same and cross topical domain. This aspect of our research sheds light on how the edits impact the model's safety metrics and guardrails. Our findings show that model editing serves as a cost-effective tool for topical red-teaming by methodically applying targeted edits and evaluating the resultant model behavior.",
    "SP3: Enhancing Structured Pruning via PCA Projection": "Structured pruning is a widely used technique for reducing the size of pre-trained language models (PLMs), but current methods often overlook the potential of compressing the hidden dimension (d) in PLMs, a dimension critical to model size and efficiency. This paper introduces a novel structured pruning approach, Structured Pruning with PCA Projection (SP3), targeting the effective reduction of d by projecting features into a space defined by principal components before masking. Extensive experiments on benchmarks (GLUE and SQuAD) show that SP3 can reduce d by 70%, compress 94% of the BERTbase model, and maintain over 96% accuracy and outperform other methods that compress d by 6% in accuracy at the same compression ratio. SP3 has also proven effective with other models, including OPT and Llama. Our data and code are available at ours repo.",
    "SPAGHETTI: Open-Domain Question Answering from Heterogeneous Data Sources with Retrieval and Semantic Parsing": "We introduce SPAGHETTI: Semantic Parsing Augmented Generation for Hybrid English information from Text Tables and Infoboxes, a hybrid question-answering (QA) pipeline that utilizes information from heterogeneous knowledge sources, including knowledge base, text, tables, and infoboxes. Our LLM-augmented approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COMPMIX dataset, the most comprehensive heterogeneous open-domain QA dataset, with 56.5% exact match (EM) rate. More importantly, manual analysis on a sample of the dataset suggests that SPAGHETTI is more than 90% accurate, indicating that EM is no longer suitable for assessing the capabilities of QA systems today.",
    "SpaRC and SpaRP: Spatial Reasoning Characterization and Path Generation for Understanding Spatial Reasoning Capability of Large Language Models": "Spatial reasoning is a crucial component of both biological and artificial intelligence. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the capability of current state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on spatial reasoning. To support our study, we created and contribute a novel Spatial Reasoning Characterization (SpaRC) framework and Spatial Reasoning Paths (SpaRP) datasets, to enable an in-depth understanding of the spatial relations and compositions as well as the usefulness of spatial reasoning chains. We found that all the state-of-the-art LLMs do not perform well on the datasets—their performances are consistently low across different setups. The spatial reasoning capability improves substantially as model sizes scale up. Finetuning both large language models (e.g., Llama-2-70B) and smaller ones (e.g., Llama-2-13B) can significantly improve their F1-scores by 7-32 absolute points. We also found that the top proprietary LLMs still significantly outperform their open-source counterparts in topological spatial understanding and reasoning.",
    "SPARSEFIT: Few-shot Prompting with Sparse Fine-tuning for Jointly Generating Predictions and Natural Language Explanations": "Models that generate natural language explanations (NLEs) for their predictions have recently gained increasing interest. However, this approach usually demands large datasets of human-written NLEs for the ground-truth answers at training time, which can be expensive and potentially infeasible for some applications. When only a few NLEs are available (a few-shot setup), fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) in conjunction with prompt-based learning has recently shown promising results. However, PLMs typically have billions of parameters, making full fine-tuning expensive. We propose SPARSEFIT, a sparse few-shot fine-tuning strategy that leverages discrete prompts to jointly generate predictions and NLEs. We experiment with SPARSEFIT on three sizes of the T5 language model and four datasets and compare it against existing state-of-the-art Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques. We find that fine-tuning only 6.8% of the model parameters leads to competitive results for both the task performance and the quality of the generated NLEs compared to full fine-tuning of the model and produces better results on average than other PEFT methods in terms of predictive accuracy and NLE quality.",
    "Sparsity-Accelerated Training for Large Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks but often require additional training, such as continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. However, the costs associated with this, primarily due to their large parameter count, remain high. This paper proposes leveraging sparsity in pre-trained LLMs to expedite this training process. By observing sparsity in activated neurons during forward iterations, we identify the potential for computational speed-ups by excluding inactive neurons. We address associated challenges by extending existing neuron importance evaluation metrics and introducing a ladder omission rate scheduler. Our experiments on Llama-2 demonstrate that Sparsity-Accelerated Training (SAT) achieves comparable or superior performance to standard training while significantly accelerating the process. Specifically, SAT achieves a 45% throughput improvement in continual pre-training and saves 38% training time in supervised fine-tuning in practice. It offers a simple, hardware-agnostic, and easily deployable framework for additional LLM training. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenDFM/SAT.",
    "Speaker Verification in Agent-generated Conversations": "The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has attracted widespread interest to develop role-playing conversational agents personalized to the characteristics and styles of different speakers to enhance their abilities to perform both general and special purpose dialogue tasks. However, the ability to personalize the generated utterances to speakers, whether conducted by human or LLM, has not been well studied. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a novel evaluation challenge: speaker verification in agent-generated conversations, which aimed to verify whether two sets of utterances originate from the same speaker. To this end, we assemble a large dataset collection encompassing thousands of speakers and their utterances. We also develop and evaluate speaker verification models under experiment setups. We further utilize the speaker verification models to evaluate the personalization abilities of LLM-based role-playing models. Comprehensive experiments suggest that the current role-playing models fail in accurately mimicking speakers, primarily due to their inherent linguistic characteristics.",
    "Spectral Filters, Dark Signals, and Attention Sinks": "Projecting intermediate representations onto the vocabulary is an increasingly popular interpretation tool for transformer-based LLMs, also known as the logit lens (Nostalgebraist). We propose a quantitative extension to this approach and define spectral filters on intermediate representations based on partitioning the singular vectors of the vocabulary embedding and unembedding matrices into bands. We find that the signals exchanged in the tail end of the spectrum, i.e. corresponding to the singular vectors with smallest singular values, are responsible for attention sinking (Xiao et al., 2023), of which we provide an explanation. We find that the negative log-likelihood of pretrained models can be kept low despite suppressing sizeable parts of the embedding spectrum in a layer-dependent way, as long as attention sinking is preserved. Finally, we discover that the representation of tokens that draw attention from many tokens have large projections on the tail end of the spectrum, and likely act as additional attention sinks.",
    "Speculative Contrastive Decoding": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance in language tasks, yet their auto-regressive inference is limited due to high computational requirements and is sub-optimal due to the exposure bias. Inspired by speculative decoding and contrastive decoding, we introduce Speculative Contrastive Decoding (SCD), a straightforward yet powerful decoding approach that leverages predictions from smaller language models (LMs) to achieve both decoding acceleration and quality improvement. Extensive evaluations and analyses on four diverse language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of SCD, showing that decoding efficiency and quality can compatibly benefit from one smaller LM.",
    "Speculative Decoding via Early-exiting for Faster LLM Inference with Thompson Sampling Control Mechanism": "The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been extraordinary, yet the escalating inference costs associated with them present challenges in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Early-exiting Speculative Decoding (EESD) with lossless acceleration. Specifically, EESD utilizes a segment of the LLM to generate draft tokens, incorporating Early-exiting structures after the first N layers. To enhance the quality of draft tokens, a self-distillation method is integrated. This early-exiting design not only reduces deployment and training costs but also significantly accelerates the token generation speed. Moreover, we introduce a novel sampling mechanism that leverages Thompson Sampling to regulate the generation processes, automatically determining the quantity of draft tokens in each round. The original LLM is then employed to validate these draft tokens through a single forward pass, and thus guarantees that the final output text maintains a distribution consistent with vanilla auto-regressive decoding. The experimental results on both 13B and 70B models demonstrate that our approach decodes tokens at a markedly accelerated rate compared to prior methods, showing the effectiveness of our approach.",
    "Speech language models lack important brain-relevant semantics": "Despite known differences between reading and listening in the brain, recent work has shown that text-based language models predict both text-evoked and speech-evoked brain activity to an impressive degree. This poses the question of what types of information language models truly predict in the brain. We investigate this question via a direct approach, in which we systematically remove specific low-level stimulus features (textual, speech, and visual) from language model representations to assess their impact on alignment with fMRI brain recordings during reading and listening. Comparing these findings with speech-based language models reveals starkly different effects of low-level features on brain alignment. While text-based models show reduced alignment in early sensory regions post-removal, they retain significant predictive power in late language regions. In contrast, speech-based models maintain strong alignment in early auditory regions even after feature removal but lose all predictive power in late language regions. These results suggest that speech-based models provide insights into additional information processed by early auditory regions, but caution is needed when using them to model processing in late language regions. We make our code publicly available.",
    "Speech Translation with Speech Foundation Models and Large Language Models: What is There and What is Missing?": "The field of natural language processing (NLP) has recently witnessed a transformative shift with the emergence of foundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) that have revolutionized text-based NLP. This paradigm has extended to other modalities, including speech, where researchers are actively exploring the combination of Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) and LLMs into single, unified models capable of addressing multimodal tasks. Among such tasks, this paper focuses on speech-to-text translation (ST). By examining the published papers on the topic, we propose a unified view of the architectural solutions and training strategies presented so far, highlighting similarities and differences among them. Based on this examination, we not only organize the lessons learned but also show how diverse settings and evaluation approaches hinder the identification of the best-performing solution for each architectural building block and training choice. Lastly, we outline recommendations for future works on the topic aimed at better understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the SFM+LLM solutions for ST.",
    "Speech vs. Transcript: Does It Matter for Human Annotators in Speech Summarization?": "Reference summaries for abstractive speech summarization require human annotation, which can be performed by listening to an audio recording or by reading textual transcripts of the recording. In this paper, we examine whether summaries based on annotators listening to the recordings differ from those based on annotators reading transcripts. Using existing intrinsic evaluation based on human evaluation, automatic metrics, LLM-based evaluation, and a retrieval-based reference-free method, we find that summaries are indeed different based on the source modality, and that speech-based summaries are more factually consistent and information-selective than transcript-based summaries. Meanwhile, transcript-based summaries are impacted by recognition errors in the source, and expert-written summaries are more informative and reliable. We make all the collected data and analysis code public to facilitate the reproduction of our work and advance research in this area.",
    "Speech-based Slot Filling using Large Language Models": "Recently, advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown an unprecedented ability across various language tasks. This paper investigates the potential application of LLMs to slot filling with noisy ASR transcriptions, via both in-context learning and task-specific fine-tuning. Dedicated prompt designs and noise-robust LoRA fine-tuning are proposed to improve the robustness of LLMs for slot filling with noisy ASR transcriptions. Moreover, a linearised knowledge injection (LKI) scheme is also proposed to integrate dynamic external knowledge into LLMs. Experiments were performed on SLURP to quantify the performance of LLMs, including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA-2-13B and Vicuna-13B (v1.1 and v1.5) with different ASR error rates. The use of the noise-robust fine-tuning together with LKI for Vicuna-13B-v1.5 achieved 6.7% and 17.6% absolute SLU-F1 improvements compared to a fully fine-tuned Flan-T5-XL model on the limited data setup and the zero-shot setup respectively.",
    "SpeechGuard: Exploring the Adversarial Robustness of Multimodal Large Language Models": "Integrated Speech and Large Language Models (SLMs) that can follow speech instructions and generate relevant text responses have gained popularity lately. However, the safety and robustness of these models remains largely unclear. In this work, we investigate the potential vulnerabilities of such instruction-following speech-language models to adversarial attacks and jailbreaking. Specifically, we design algorithms that can generate adversarial examples to jailbreak SLMs in both white-box and black-box attack settings without human involvement. Additionally, we propose countermeasures to thwart such jailbreaking attacks. Our models, trained on dialog data with speech instructions, achieve state-of-the-art performance on spoken question-answering task, scoring over 80% on both safety and helpfulness metrics. Despite safety guardrails, experiments on jailbreaking demonstrate the vulnerability of SLMs to adversarial perturbations and transfer attacks, with average attack success rates of 90% and 10% respectively when evaluated on a dataset of carefully designed harmful questions spanning 12 different toxic categories. However, we demonstrate that our proposed countermeasures reduce the attack success significantly.",
    "SPIN: Sparsifying and Integrating Internal Neurons in Large Language Models for Text Classification": "Among the many tasks that Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized is text classification. Current text classification paradigms, however, rely solely on the output of the final layer in the LLM, with the rich information contained in internal neurons largely untapped. In this study, we present SPIN: a model-agnostic framework that sparsifies and integrates internal neurons of intermediate layers of LLMs for text classification. Specifically, SPIN sparsifies internal neurons by linear probing-based salient neuron selection layer by layer, avoiding noise from unrelated neurons and ensuring efficiency. The cross-layer salient neurons are then integrated to serve as multi-layered features for the classification head. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed framework can significantly improve text classification accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability.",
    "Spiral of Silence: How is Large Language Model Killing Information Retrieval?—A Case Study on Open Domain Question Answering": "The practice of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with retrieval systems, has become increasingly prevalent. However, the repercussions of LLM-derived content infiltrating the web and influencing the retrieval-generation feedback loop are largely uncharted territories. In this study, we construct and iteratively run a simulation pipeline to deeply investigate the short-term and long-term effects of LLM text on RAG systems. Taking the trending Open Domain Question Answering (ODQA) task as a point of entry, our findings reveal a potential digital “Spiral of Silence” effect, with LLM-generated text consistently outperforming human-authored content in search rankings, thereby diminishing the presence and impact of human contributions online. This trend risks creating an imbalanced information ecosystem, where the unchecked proliferation of erroneous LLM-generated content may result in the marginalization of accurate information. We urge the academic community to take heed of this potential issue, ensuring a diverse and authentic digital information landscape.",
    "Split and Rephrase with Large Language Models": "The Split and Rephrase (SPRP) task, which consists in splitting complex sentences into a sequence of shorter grammatical sentences, while preserving the original meaning, can facilitate the processing of complex texts for humans and machines alike. It is also a valuable testbed to evaluate natural language processing models, as it requires modelling complex grammatical aspects. In this work, we evaluate large language models on the task, showing that they can provide large improvements over the state of the art on the main metrics, although still lagging in terms of splitting compliance. Results from two human evaluations further support the conclusions drawn from automated metric results. We provide a comprehensive study that includes prompting variants, domain shift, fine-tuned pretrained language models of varying parameter size and training data volumes, contrasted with both zero-shot and few-shot approaches on instruction-tuned language models. Although the latter were markedly outperformed by fine-tuned models, they may constitute a reasonable off-the-shelf alternative. Our results provide a fine-grained analysis of the potential and limitations of large language models for SPRP, with significant improvements achievable using relatively small amounts of training data and model parameters overall, and remaining limitations for all models on the task.",
    "SPOR: A Comprehensive and Practical Evaluation Method for Compositional Generalization in Data-to-Text Generation": "Compositional generalization is an important ability of language models and has many different manifestations. For data-to-text generation, previous research on this ability is limited to a single manifestation called Systematicity and lacks consideration of large language models (LLMs), which cannot fully cover practical application scenarios. In this work, we propose SPOR, a comprehensive and practical evaluation method for compositional generalization in data-to-text generation. SPOR includes four aspects of manifestations (Systematicity, Productivity, Order invariance, and Rule learnability) and allows high-quality evaluation without additional manual annotations based on existing datasets. We demonstrate SPOR on two different datasets and evaluate some existing language models including LLMs. We find that the models are deficient in various aspects of the evaluation and need further improvement. Our work shows the necessity for comprehensive research on different manifestations of compositional generalization in data-to-text generation and provides a framework for evaluation.",
    "SportsMetrics: Blending Text and Numerical Data to Understand Information Fusion in LLMs": "Large language models hold significant potential for integrating various data types, such as text documents and database records, for advanced analytics. However, blending text and numerical data presents substantial challenges. LLMs need to process and cross-reference entities and numbers, handle data inconsistencies and redundancies, and develop planning capabilities such as building a working memory for managing complex data queries. In this paper, we introduce four novel tasks centered around sports data analytics to evaluate the numerical reasoning and information fusion capabilities of LLMs. These tasks involve providing LLMs with detailed, play-by-play sports game descriptions, then challenging them with adversarial scenarios such as new game rules, longer durations, scrambled narratives, and analyzing key statistics in game summaries. We conduct extensive experiments on NBA and NFL games to assess the performance of LLMs on these tasks. Our benchmark, SportsMetrics, introduces a new mechanism for assessing LLMs' numerical reasoning and fusion skills.",
    "Spotting AI's Touch: Identifying LLM-Paraphrased Spans in Text": "AI-generated text detection has attracted increasing attention as powerful language models approach human-level generation. Limited work is devoted to detecting (partially) AI-paraphrased texts. However, AI paraphrasing is commonly employed in various application scenarios for text refinement and diversity. To this end, we propose a novel detection framework, paraphrased text span detection (PTD), aiming to identify paraphrased text spans within a text. Different from text-level detection, PTD takes in the full text and assigns each of the sentences with a score indicating the paraphrasing degree. We construct a dedicated dataset, PASTED, for paraphrased text span detection. Both in-distribution and out-of-distribution results demonstrate the effectiveness of PTD models in identifying AI-paraphrased text spans. Statistical and model analysis explains the crucial role of the surrounding context of the paraphrased text spans. Extensive experiments show that PTD models can generalize to versatile paraphrasing prompts and multiple paraphrased text spans.",
    "SRCB at #SMM4H 2024: Making Full Use of LLM-based Data Augmentation in Adverse Drug Event Extraction and Normalization": "This paper reports on the performance of SRCB's system in the Social Media Mining for Health (#SMM4H) 2024 Shared Task 1: extraction and normalization of adverse drug events (ADEs) in English tweets. We develop a system composed of an ADE extraction module and an ADE normalization module which further includes a retrieval module and a filtering module. To alleviate the data imbalance and other issues introduced by the dataset, we employ 4 data augmentation techniques based on Large Language Models (LLMs) across both modules. Our best submission achieves an F1 score of 53.6 (49.4 on the unseen subset) on the ADE normalization task and an F1 score of 52.1 on ADE extraction task.",
    "SSS: Editing Factual Knowledge in Language Models towards Semantic Sparse Space": "Language Models (LMs) acquire factual knowledge during pre-training and store it in the parameters, which can be valuable for downstream tasks. As the world evolves, some facts may be incorrectly induced or become obsolete over time. Various model editing methods have been proposed to modify specific examples in LMs. However, existing training-based methods still suffer from sub-optimal locality, where irrelevant neighborhood examples can be adversely influenced. Model's gradients are still struggling to identify the appropriate direction when updating the parameters. To address this issue, we find that directing the hidden state of the edit example towards spaces where semantics are sparse tends to help preserve the semantics of irrelevant neighborhood examples. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a novel metric, named SSS, to evaluate the degree of sparsity around a sentence embedding in the semantic space without any human or machine annotation. Subsequently, we incorporate SSS into the original loss function of the existing training-based methods to enhance locality. Experiments conducted on two datasets across various models demonstrate that SSS is effective in improving both locality and reasoning capability. Code will be available at: https://github.com/MaybeLizzy/EditSSS.",
    "StableToolBench: Towards Stable Large-Scale Benchmarking on Tool Learning of Large Language Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, prompting the exploration of tool learning, which integrates LLMs with external tools to address diverse real-world challenges. Assessing the capability of LLMs to utilise tools necessitates large-scale and stable benchmarks. However, previous works relied on either hand-crafted online tools with limited scale, or large-scale real online APIs suffering from instability of API status. To address this problem, we introduce StableToolBench, a benchmark evolving from ToolBench, proposing a virtual API server and stable evaluation system. The virtual API server contains a caching system and API simulators which are complementary to alleviate the change in API status. Meanwhile, the stable evaluation system designs solvable pass and win rates using GPT-4 as the automatic evaluator to eliminate the randomness during evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the stability of StableToolBench, and further discuss the effectiveness of API simulators, the caching system, and the evaluator system.",
    "STAGE: Simplified Text-Attributed Graph Embeddings Using Pre-trained LLMs": "We present Simplified Text-Attributed Graph Embeddings (STAGE), a straightforward yet effective method for enhancing node features in Graph Neural Network (GNN) models that encode Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs). Our approach leverages Large-Language Models (LLMs) to generate embeddings for textual attributes. STAGE achieves competitive results on various node classification benchmarks while also maintaining a simplicity in implementation relative to current state-of-the-art (SoTA) techniques. We show that utilizing pre-trained LLMs as embedding generators provides robust features for ensemble GNN training, enabling pipelines that are simpler than current SoTA approaches which require multiple expensive training and prompting stages. We also implement diffusion-pattern GNNs in an effort to make this pipeline scalable to graphs beyond academic benchmarks.",
    "STAR: Constraint LoRA with Dynamic Active Learning for Data-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models": "Though Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the powerful capabilities of few-shot learning through prompting methods, supervised training is still necessary for complex reasoning tasks. Because of their extensive parameters and memory consumption, both Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods and Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods have been proposed for LLMs. Nevertheless, the issue of large annotated data consumption, the aim of Data-Efficient Fine-Tuning, remains unexplored. One obvious way is to combine the PEFT method with active learning. However, the experimental results show that such a combination is not trivial and yields inferior results. Through probe experiments, such observation might be explained by two main reasons: uncertainty gap and poor model calibration. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to effectively integrate uncertainty-based active learning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Specifically, for the uncertainty gap, we introduce a dynamic uncertainty measurement that combines the uncertainty of the base model and the uncertainty of the full model during the iteration of active learning. For poor model calibration, we incorporate the regularization method during LoRA training to keep the model from being over-confident, and the Monte-Carlo dropout mechanism is employed to enhance the uncertainty estimation. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing baseline models on three complex reasoning tasks.",
    "STARLING: Self-supervised Training of Text-based Reinforcement Learning Agent with Large Language Models": "Interactive fiction games have emerged as an important application to improve the generalization capabilities of language-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Existing environments for interactive fiction games are domain-specific or time-consuming to generate and do not train the RL agents to master a specific set of skills. In this work, we introduce an interactive environment for self-supervised RL, STARLING, for text-based games that bootstraps the text-based RL agents with automatically generated games (based on the seed set of game ideas) to boost the performance and generalization capabilities to reach a goal of the target environment. These games let the agent hone their skills on a predefined set of tasks. We create and test an environment with 100 games, generated using this automated framework that uses large language models (GPT3) and an interactive fiction game engine (based on Inform7) to provide the user with the ability to generate more games under minimal human supervision. Experimental results based on both the human participants and baseline text-based RL agents reveal that current state-of-the-art text-based RL agents cannot use previously learned skills in new situations at the level humans can. These results enforce STARLING's potential to serve as a sandbox environment for further research in self-supervised text-based RL.",
    "StatBot.Swiss: Bilingual Open Data Exploration in Natural Language": "The potential for improvements brought by Large Language Models (LLMs) in Text-to-SQL systems is mostly assessed on monolingual English datasets. However, LLMs' performance for other languages remains vastly unexplored. In this work, we release the StatBot.Swiss dataset, the first bilingual benchmark for evaluating Text-to-SQL systems based on real-world applications. The StatBot.Swiss dataset contains 455 natural language/SQL-pairs over 35 big databases with varying levels of complexity for both English and German. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-3.5-Turbo and Mixtral-8x7b-instruct for the Text-to-SQL translation task using an in-context learning approach. Our experimental analysis illustrates that current LLMs struggle to generalize well in generating SQL queries on our novel bilingual dataset.",
    "Statements: Universal Information Extraction from Tables with Large Language Models for ESG KPIs": "Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) KPIs assess an organization's performance on issues such as climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, waste management, human rights, diversity, and policies. ESG reports convey this valuable quantitative information through tables. Unfortunately, extracting this information is difficult due to high variability in the table structure as well as content. We propose Statements, a novel domain agnostic data-structure for extracting quantitative facts and related information. We propose translating tables to statements as a new supervised deep-learning universal information extraction task. We introduce SemTab-Net - a dataset of over 100K annotated tables. Investigating a family of T5-based Statement Extraction Models, our best model generates statements which are 82% similar to the ground-truth (compared to baseline of 21%). We demonstrate the advantages of statements by applying our model to over 2700 tables from ESG reports. The homogeneous nature of statements permits exploratory data analysis on expansive information found in large collections of ESG reports.",
    "Stealthy Attack on Large Language Model based Recommendation": "Recently, the powerful large language models (LLMs) have been instrumental in propelling the progress of recommender systems (RS). However, while these systems have flourished, their susceptibility to security threats has been largely overlooked. In this work, we reveal that the introduction of LLMs into recommendation models presents new security vulnerabilities due to their emphasis on the textual content of items. We demonstrate that attackers can significantly boost an item's exposure by merely altering its textual content during the testing phase, without requiring direct interference with the model's training process. Additionally, the attack is notably stealthy, as it does not affect the overall recommendation performance and the modifications to the text are subtle, making it difficult for users and platforms to detect. Our comprehensive experiments across four mainstream LLM-based recommendation models demonstrate the superior efficacy and stealthiness of our approach. Our work unveils a significant security gap in LLM-based recommendation systems and paves the way for future research on protecting these systems.",
    "Steering Llama 2 via Contrastive Activation Addition": "We introduce Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), a method for steering language models by modifying their activations during forward passes. CAA computes “steering vectors” by averaging the difference in residual stream activations between pairs of positive and negative examples of a particular behavior, such as factual versus hallucinatory responses. During inference, these steering vectors are added at all token positions after the user's prompt with either a positive or negative coefficient, allowing precise control over the degree of the targeted behavior. We evaluate CAA's effectiveness on Llama 2 Chat using multiple-choice behavioral question datasets and open-ended generation tasks. We demonstrate that CAA significantly alters model behavior, is effective over and on top of traditional methods like finetuning and system prompt design, and minimally reduces capabilities. Moreover, we gain deeper insights into CAA's mechanisms by employing various activation space interpretation methods. CAA accurately steers model outputs and sheds light on how high-level concepts are represented in Large Language Models (LLMs).",
    "STEP: Staged Parameter-Efficient Pre-training for Large Language Models": "Pre-training large language models faces significant memory challenges due to the large size of model weights. We propose STaged parameter-Efficient Pre-training (STEP), which combines ideas from parameter-efficient tuning and staged training. We conduct experiments on pre-training models of various sizes and demonstrate that STEP can achieve up to a 40.4% reduction in maximum memory requirement compared to vanilla pre-training while maintaining comparable performance.",
    "StepCoder: Improving Code Generation with Reinforcement Learning from Compiler Feedback": "The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the field of code generation. Previous work integrated reinforcement learning (RL) with compiler feedback for exploring the output space of LLMs to enhance code generation quality. However, the lengthy code generated by LLMs in response to complex human requirements makes RL exploration a challenge. Also, since the unit tests may not cover the complicated code, optimizing LLMs by using these unexecuted code snippets is ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we introduce StepCoder, a novel RL framework for code generation, consisting of two main components: CCCS addresses the exploration challenge by breaking the long sequences code generation task into a Curriculum of Code Completion Subtasks, while FGO only optimizes the model by masking the unexecuted code segments to provide Fine-Grained Optimization. In addition, we furthermore construct the APPS+ dataset for RL training, which is manually verified to ensure the correctness of unit tests. Experimental results show that our method improves the ability to explore the output space and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in corresponding benchmarks.",
    "STICKERCONV: Generating Multimodal Empathetic Responses from Scratch": "Stickers, while widely recognized for enhancing empathetic communication in online interactions, remain underexplored in current empathetic dialogue research, notably due to the challenge of a lack of comprehensive datasets. In this paper, we introduce the Agent for STICKERCONV (Agent4SC), which uses collaborative agent interactions to realistically simulate human behavior with sticker usage, thereby enhancing multimodal empathetic communication. Building on this foundation, we develop a multimodal empathetic dialogue dataset, STICKERCONV, comprising 12.9K dialogue sessions, 5.8K unique stickers, and 2K diverse conversational scenarios. This dataset serves as a benchmark for multimodal empathetic generation. To advance further, we propose PErceive and Generate Stickers (PEGS), a multimodal empathetic response generation framework, complemented by a comprehensive set of empathy evaluation metrics based on LLM. Our experiments demonstrate PEGS's effectiveness in generating contextually relevant and emotionally resonant multimodal empathetic responses, contributing to the advancement of more nuanced and engaging empathetic dialogue systems.",
    "StreamVoice: Streamable Context-Aware Language Modeling for Real-time Zero-Shot Voice Conversion": "Recent language model (LM) advancements have showcased impressive zero-shot voice conversion (VC) performance. However, existing LM-based VC models usually apply offline conversion from source semantics to acoustic features, demanding the complete source speech and limiting their deployment to real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce StreamVoice, a novel streaming LM-based model for zero-shot VC, facilitating real-time conversion given arbitrary speaker prompts and source speech. Specifically, to enable streaming capability, StreamVoice employs a fully causal context-aware LM with a temporal-independent acoustic predictor, while alternately processing semantic and acoustic features at each time step of autoregression which eliminates the dependence on complete source speech. To address the potential performance degradation from the incomplete context in streaming processing, we enhance the context-awareness of the LM through two strategies: 1) teacher-guided context foresight, using a teacher model to summarize the present and future semantic context during training to guide the model's forecasting for missing context; 2) semantic masking strategy, promoting acoustic prediction from preceding corrupted semantic and acoustic input, enhancing context-learning ability. Notably, StreamVoice is the first LM-based streaming zero-shot VC model without any future look-ahead. Experiments demonstrate StreamVoice's streaming conversion capability while achieving zero-shot performance comparable to non-streaming VC systems.",
    "Strengthened Symbol Binding Makes Large Language Models Reliable": "Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) constitute a critical area of research in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs). Previous works have investigated the selection bias problem in MCQs within few-shot scenarios, in which the LLM's performance may be influenced by the presentation of answer choices, leaving the selection bias during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) unexplored. In this paper, we reveal that selection bias persists in the SFT phase, primarily due to the LLM's inadequate Multiple Choice Symbol Binding (MCSB) ability. This limitation implies that the model struggles to associate the answer options with their corresponding symbols (e.g., A/B/C/D) effectively. To enhance the model's MCSB capability, we first incorporate option contents into the loss function and subsequently adjust the weights of the option symbols and contents, guiding the model to understand the option content of the current symbol. Based on this, we introduce an efficient SFT algorithm for MCQs, termed Point-wise Intelligent Feedback (PIF). PIF constructs negative instances by randomly combining the incorrect option contents with all candidate symbols, and proposes a point-wise loss to provide feedback on these negative samples into LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that PIF significantly reduces the model's selection bias by improving its MCSB capability. Remarkably, PIF exhibits a substantial enhancement in the accuracy for MCQs.",
    "Striking Gold in Advertising: Standardization and Exploration of Ad Text Generation": "In response to the limitations of manual ad creation, significant research has been conducted in the field of automatic ad text generation (ATG). However, the lack of comprehensive benchmarks and well-defined problem sets has made comparing different methods challenging. To tackle these challenges, we standardize the task of ATG and propose a first benchmark dataset, CAMERA, carefully designed and enabling the utilization of multi-modal information and facilitating industry-wise evaluations. Our extensive experiments with a variety of nine baselines, from classical methods to state-of-the-art models including large language models (LLMs), show the current state and the remaining challenges. We also explore how existing metrics in ATG and an LLM-based evaluator align with human evaluations.",
    "Strong hallucinations from negation and how to fix them": "Despite great performance on many tasks, language models (LMs) still struggle with reasoning, sometimes providing responses that cannot possibly be true because they stem from logical incoherence. We call such responses strong hallucinations and prove that they follow from an LM's computation of its internal representations for logical operators and outputs from those representations. Focusing on negation, we provide a novel solution in which negation is treated not as another element of a latent representation, but as an operation over an LM's latent representations that constrains how they may evolve. We show that our approach improves model performance in cloze prompting and natural language inference tasks with negation without requiring training on sparse negative data.",
    "StructEval: Deepen and Broaden Large Language Model Assessment via Structured Evaluation": "Evaluation is the baton for the development of large language models (LLMs). Current evaluations typically employ a single-item assessment paradigm for each atomic test objective, which struggles to discern whether a model genuinely possesses the required capabilities or merely memorizes/guesses the answers to specific questions. To this end, this paper proposes a novel evaluation framework referred to as StructEval. Starting from an atomic test objective, StructEval deepens and broadens the evaluation by conducting a structured assessment across multiple cognitive levels and critical concepts, and therefore offers a comprehensive, robust and consistent evaluation for LLMs. Experiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that StructEval serves as a reliable tool for resisting the risk of data contamination and reducing the interference of potential biases, thereby providing more reliable and consistent conclusions regarding model capabilities. Our framework also sheds light on the design of future principled and trustworthy LLM evaluation protocols.",
    "STRUCTSUM Generation for Faster Text Comprehension": "We consider the task of generating structured representations of text using large language models (LLMs). We focus on tables and mind maps as representative modalities. Tables are more organized way of representing data, while mind maps provide a visually dynamic and flexible approach, particularly suitable for sparse content. Despite the effectiveness of LLMs on different tasks, we show that current models struggle with generating structured outputs. In response, we present effective prompting strategies for both of these tasks. We introduce a taxonomy of problems around factuality, global and local structure, common to both modalities and propose a set of critiques to tackle these issues resulting in an absolute improvement in accuracy of +37pp (79%) for mind maps and +15pp (78%) for tables. To evaluate semantic coverage of generated structured representations we propose AUTO-QA, and we verify the adequacy of AUTO-QA using SQuAD dataset. We further evaluate the usefulness of structured representations via a text comprehension user study. The results show a significant reduction in comprehension time compared to text when using table (42.9%) and mind map (31.9%), without loss in accuracy.",
    "Structuring Sustainability Reports for Environmental Standards with LLMs guided by Ontology": "Following the introduction of the European Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS), companies will have to adapt to a new policy and provide mandatory sustainability reports. However, implementing such reports entails a challenge, such as the comprehension of a large number of textual information from various sources. This task can be accelerated by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) and ontologies to effectively model the domain knowledge.  In this study, we extended an existing ontology to model ESRS Topical Standard for disclosure. The developed ontology would enable automated reasoning over the data and assist in constructing Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Moreover, the proposed ontology extension would also help to identify gaps in companies' sustainability reports with regard to the ESRS requirements. Additionally, we extracted knowledge from corporate sustainability reports via LLMs guided with a proposed ontology and developed their KG representation.",
    "STUDENTEVAL: A Benchmark of Student-Written Prompts for Large Language Models of Code": "Code LLMs have the potential to make it easier for non-experts to understand and write code. However, current CodeLLM benchmarks rely on a single expert-written prompt per problem, making it hard to generalize their success to non-expert users. In this paper, we present a new natural-language-to-code benchmark of prompts written by a key population of non-experts: beginning programmers. STUDENTEVAL contains 1,749 prompts written by 80 students who have only completed one introductory Python course. STUDENTEVAL contains numerous non-expert prompts describing the same problem, enabling exploration of key factors in prompt success. We use STUDENTEVAL to evaluate 12 Code LLMs and find that STUDENTEVAL is a better discriminator of model performance than existing benchmarks. Our analysis of student prompting strategies reveals that nondeterministic LLM sampling can mislead students about the quality of their descriptions, a finding with key implications for Code LLMs in education.",
    "Stumbling Blocks: Stress Testing the Robustness of Machine-Generated Text Detectors Under Attacks": "The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) is increasing the demand for methods that detect machine-generated text to prevent misuse. The goal of our study is to stress test the detectors' robustness to malicious attacks under realistic scenarios. We comprehensively study the robustness of popular machine-generated text detectors under attacks from diverse categories: editing, paraphrasing, co-generating, and prompting. Our attacks assume limited access to the generator LLMs, and we compare the performance of detectors on different attacks under different budget levels. Our experiments reveal that almost none of the existing detectors remain robust under all the attacks, and all detectors exhibit different loopholes. Averaging all detectors, the performance drops by 35% across all attacks. Further, we investigate the reasons behind these defects and propose initial out-of-the-box patches.",
    "STYLE: Improving Domain Transferability of Asking Clarification Questions in Large Language Model Powered Conversational Agents": "Equipping a conversational search engine with strategies regarding when to ask clarification questions is becoming increasingly important across various domains. Attributing to the context understanding capability of LLMs and their access to domain-specific sources of knowledge, LLM-based clarification strategies feature rapid transfer to various domains in a post-hoc manner. However, they still struggle to deliver promising performance on unseen domains, struggling to achieve effective domain transferability. We take the first step to investigate this issue and existing methods tend to produce one-size-fits-all strategies across diverse domains, limiting their search effectiveness. In response, we introduce a novel method, called STYLE, to achieve effective domain transferability. Our experimental results indicate that STYLE bears strong domain transferability, resulting in an average search performance improvement of ∼10% on four unseen domains.",
    "Subjectivity Detection in English News using Large Language Models": "Trust in media has reached a historical low as consumers increasingly doubt the credibility of the news they encounter. This growing skepticism is exacerbated by the prevalence of opinion-driven articles, which can influence readers' beliefs to align with the authors' viewpoints. In response to this trend, this study examines the expression of opinions in news by detecting subjective and objective language. We conduct an analysis of the subjectivity present in various news datasets and evaluate how different language models detect subjectivity and generalize to out-of-distribution data. We also investigate the use of in-context learning (ICL) within large language models (LLMs) and propose a straightforward prompting method that outperforms standard ICL and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts.",
    "Subtle Biases Need Subtler Measures: Dual Metrics for Evaluating Representative and Affinity Bias in Large Language Models": "Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has often neglected subtle biases that, although less apparent, can significantly influence the models' outputs toward particular social narratives. This study addresses two such biases within LLMs: representative bias, which denotes a tendency of LLMs to generate outputs that mirror the experiences of certain identity groups, and affinity bias, reflecting the models' evaluative preferences for specific narratives or viewpoints. We introduce two novel metrics to measure these biases: the Representative Bias Score (RBS) and the Affinity Bias Score (ABS), and present the Creativity-Oriented Generation Suite (CoGS), a collection of open-ended tasks such as short story writing and poetry composition, designed with customized rubrics to detect these subtle biases. Our analysis uncovers marked representative biases in prominent LLMs, with a preference for identities associated with being white, straight, and men. Furthermore, our investigation of affinity bias reveals distinctive evaluative patterns within each model, akin to 'bias fingerprints'. This trend is also seen in human evaluators, highlighting a complex interplay between human and machine bias perceptions.",
    "Subtle Signatures, Strong Shields: Advancing Robust and Imperceptible Watermarking in Large Language Models": "The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to an increase in AI-generated text on the Internet, presenting a crucial challenge to differentiate AI-created content from human-written text. This challenge is critical to prevent issues of authenticity, trust, and potential copyright violations. Current research focuses on watermarking LLM-generated text, but traditional techniques struggle to balance robustness with text quality. We introduce a novel watermarking approach, Robust and Imperceptible Watermarking (RIW) for LLMs, which leverages token prior probabilities to improve detectability and maintain watermark imperceptibility. RIW methodically embeds watermarks by partitioning selected tokens into two distinct groups based on their prior probabilities and employing tailored strategies for each group. In the detection stage, RIW method employs the 'voted z-test' to provide a statistically robust framework to identify the presence of a watermark accurately. The effectiveness of RIW is evaluated across three key dimensions: success rate, text quality, and robustness against removal attacks. Our experimental results on various LLMs, including GPT2-XL, OPT-1.3B, and LLaMA2-7B, indicate that RIW surpasses existing models, and also exhibits increased robustness against various attacks and good imperceptibility, thus promoting the responsible use of LLMs.",
    "SummEQuAL: Summarization Evaluation via Question Answering using Large Language Models": "Summarization is hard to evaluate due to its diverse and abstract nature. Although N-gram-based metrics like BLEU and ROUGE are prevalent, they often do not align well with human evaluations. While model-based alternatives such as BERTScore improve, they typically require extensive labelled data. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a promising avenue for evaluation. To this end, we introduce SummEQuAL, a novel content-based framework using LLMs for unified, reproducible summarization evaluation. SummEQuAL evaluates summaries by comparing their content with the source document, employing a question-answering approach to gauge both recall and precision. To validate SummEQuAL's effectiveness, we develop a dataset based on MultiWOZ. We conduct experiments on SummEval and our MultiWOZ-based dataset, showing that SummEQuAL largely improves the quality of summarization evaluation. Notably, SummEQuAL demonstrates a 19.7% improvement over QuestEval in terms of sample-level Pearson correlation with human assessments of consistency on the SummEval dataset. Furthermore, it exceeds the performance of the BERTScore baseline by achieving a 17.3% increase in Spearman correlation on our MultiWOZ-based dataset. Our study illuminates the potential of LLMs for a unified evaluation framework, setting a new paradigm for future summarization evaluation.",
    "Super donors and super recipients: Studying cross-lingual transfer between high-resource and low-resource languages": "Despite the increasing popularity of multilingualism within the NLP community, numerous languages continue to be underrepresented due to the lack of available resources. Our work addresses this gap by introducing experiments on cross-lingual transfer between 158 high-resource (HR) and 31 low-resource (LR) languages. We mainly focus on extremely LR languages, some of which are first presented in research works. Across 158 ∗31 HR-LR language pairs, we investigate how continued pretraining on different HR languages affects the mT5 model's performance in representing LR languages in the LM setup. Our findings surprisingly reveal that the optimal language pairs with improved performance do not necessarily align with direct linguistic motivations, with subtoken overlap playing a more crucial role. Our investigation indicates that specific languages tend to be almost universally beneficial for pretraining (super donors), while others benefit from pretraining with almost any language (super recipients). This pattern recurs in various setups and is unrelated to the linguistic similarity of HR-LR pairs. Furthermore, we perform evaluation on two downstream tasks, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and machine translation (MT), showing how HR pretraining affects LR language performance.",
    "Superfiltering: Weak-to-Strong Data Filtering for Fast Instruction-Tuning": "Instruction tuning is critical to improve LLMs but usually suffers from low-quality and redundant data. Data filtering for instruction tuning has proved important in improving both the efficiency and performance of the tuning process. But it also leads to extra cost and computation due to the involvement of LLMs in this process. To reduce the filtering cost, we study Superfiltering: Can we use a smaller and weaker model to select data for finetuning a larger and stronger model? Despite the performance gap between weak and strong language models, we find their highly consistent capability to perceive instruction difficulty and data selection results. This enables us to use a much smaller and more efficient model to filter the instruction data used to train a larger language model. Not only does it largely speed up the data filtering, but the filtered-data-finetuned LLM achieves even better performance on standard benchmarks. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy and efficiency of our approach.",
    "Sure, here is the title: SoFA: Shielded On-the-fly Alignment via Priority Rule Following": "Content warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language. The alignment problem in Large Language Models (LLMs) involves adapting them to the broad spectrum of human values. This requirement challenges existing alignment methods due to diversity of preferences and regulatory standards. This paper introduces a novel alignment paradigm, priority rule following, which defines rules as the primary control mechanism in each dialog, prioritizing them over user instructions. Our preliminary analysis reveals that even the advanced LLMs, such as GPT-4, exhibit shortcomings in understanding and prioritizing the rules. Therefore, we present PRIORITYDISTILL, a semi-automated approach for distilling priority following signals from LLM simulations to ensure robust rule integration and adherence. Our experiments show that this method not only effectively minimizes misalignments utilizing only one general rule but also adapts smoothly to various unseen rules, ensuring they are shielded from hijacking and that the model responds appropriately.",
    "Surgical Feature-Space Decomposition of LLMs: Why, When and How?": "Low-rank approximations, of the weight and feature space can enhance the performance of deep learning models, whether in terms of improving generalization or reducing the latency of inference. However, there is no clear consensus yet on how, when and why these approximations are helpful for large language models (LLMs). In this work, we empirically study the efficacy of weight and feature space decomposition in transformer-based LLMs. We demonstrate that surgical decomposition not only provides critical insights into the trade-off between compression and language modelling performance, but also sometimes enhances common-sense reasoning performance of LLMs. Our empirical analysis identifies specific network segments that intrinsically exhibit a low-rank structure. Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the implications of low-rank approximations on model bias. Overall, our findings offer a novel perspective on optimizing LLMs, presenting the low-rank approximation not only as a tool for performance enhancements, but also as a means to potentially rectify biases within these models.",
    "SwapMoE: Serving Off-the-shelf MoE-based Large Language Models with Tunable Memory Budget": "Mixture of experts (MoE) is a popular technique to improve capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) with conditionally-activated parallel experts. However, serving MoE models on memory-constrained devices is challenging due to the large parameter size. Typical solutions such as memory swapping or expert pruning may lead to significantly higher latency or severe accuracy loss. In this paper, we introduce SwapMoE, a framework for efficient serving of MoE-based large language models with tunable memory budgets. The main idea of SwapMoE is to keep a small dynamic set of important experts, namely Virtual Experts, in the main memory for inference, while seamlessly maintaining how the Virtual Experts map to the actual experts. Experiments have shown that SwapMoE can reduce the memory footprint while maintaining reasonable accuracy. For example, on text summarization tasks with Switch Transformer, SwapMoE can reduce the memory consumption from 14.2 GiB to 4.7 GiB, together with 50% latency reduction and a slight Rouge-2 score drop of 0.041.",
    "SYLLABUSQA: A Course Logistics Question Answering Dataset": "Automated teaching assistants and chatbots have significant potential to reduce the workload of human instructors, especially for logistics-related question answering, which is important to students yet repetitive for instructors. However, due to privacy concerns, there is a lack of publicly available datasets. We introduce SYLLABUSQA, an open-source dataset with 63 real course syllabi covering 36 majors, containing 5,078 open-ended course logistics-related question-answer pairs that are diverse in both question types and answer formats. Since many logistics-related questions contain critical information like the date of an exam, it is important to evaluate the factuality of answers. We benchmark several strong baselines on this task, from large language model prompting to retrieval-augmented generation. We introduce Fact-QA, an LLM-based (GPT-4) evaluation metric to evaluate the factuality of predicted answers. We find that despite performing close to humans on traditional metrics of textual similarity, there remains a significant gap between automated approaches and humans in terms of fact precision.",
    "Symbol-LLM: Towards Foundational Symbol-centric Interface For Large Language Models": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable ability in processing and generating human-like text, they do have limitations when it comes to comprehending and expressing world knowledge that extends beyond the boundaries of natural language (e.g., chemical molecular formula). Injecting a collection of symbolic data directly into the training of LLMs can be problematic, as it disregards the synergies among different symbolic families and overlooks the need for a balanced mixture of natural and symbolic data. In this work, we tackle these challenges from both a data and framework perspective and introduce Symbol-LLM series models. First, we curated a data collection consisting of 34 tasks and incorporating 20 distinct symbolic families, intending to capture the interrelations and foster synergies between symbols. Then, a two-stage tuning framework succeeds in injecting symbolic knowledge without loss of the generality ability. Extensive experiments on both symbol- and NL-centric tasks demonstrate the balanced and superior performances of Symbol-LLM series models. The project page is https://xufangzhi.github.io/symbol-llm-page/.",
    "SymKGQA: Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Question Answering via Symbolic Program Generation and Execution": "Semantic Parsing of natural language questions into their executable logical form (LF) has shown state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). However, these methods are not applicable for real-world applications, due to lack of KG-specific training data. Recent advances in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led towards generating low-level LFs such as SPARQL and S-Expression in a few-shot setting. Unfortunately, these methods: (1) are limited to the knowledge of underlying LLM about the LF, (2) performs inferior for the harder complex benchmarks such as KQA Pro, (3) suffers while grounding the generated LF to a specific Knowledge Graph. Recently, a new LF called KoPL (Cao et al., 2022a) has been introduced that explicitly models complex reasoning process step-by-step in a symbolic manner and has shown SOTA on KQA Pro in fully-supervised setting. Inspired by this, we propose SymKGQA1 framework that generates step-by-step Symbolic LF i.e., KoPL in a few-shot in-context learning setting using LLM. Our framework is not dependent on pre-trained knowledge of LLM about KoPL. We further build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Question-Aware Contextual KoPL (QUACK) resolver to ground the generated LF. Our experiments with different LLMs and few-shot settings demonstrate that SymKGQA outperforms all other few-shot and even many of the fully-supervised KGQA approaches.",
    "Synchronized Video Storytelling: Generating Video Narrations with Structured Storyline": "Video storytelling is engaging multimedia content that utilizes video and its accompanying narration to attract the audience, where a key challenge is creating narrations for recorded visual scenes. Previous studies on dense video captioning and video story generation have made some progress. However, in practical applications, we typically require synchronized narrations for ongoing visual scenes. In this work, we introduce a new task of Synchronized Video Storytelling, which aims to generate synchronous and informative narrations for videos. These narrations, associated with each video clip, should relate to the visual content, integrate relevant knowledge, and have an appropriate word count corresponding to the clip's duration. Specifically, a structured storyline is beneficial to guide the generation process, ensuring coherence and integrity. To support the exploration of this task, we introduce a new benchmark dataset E-SyncVidStory with rich annotations. Since existing Multimodal LLMs are not effective in addressing this task in one-shot or few-shot settings, we propose a framework named VideoNarrator that can generate a storyline for input videos and simultaneously generate narrations with the guidance of the generated or predefined storyline. We further introduce a set of evaluation metrics to thoroughly assess the generation. Both automatic and human evaluations validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our dataset, codes, and evaluations will be released.",
    "Synergetic Event Understanding: A Collaborative Approach to Cross-Document Event Coreference Resolution with Large Language Models": "Cross-document event coreference resolution (CDECR) involves clustering event mentions across multiple documents that refer to the same real-world events. Existing approaches utilize fine-tuning of small language models (SLMs) like BERT to address the compatibility among the contexts of event mentions. However, due to the complexity and diversity of contexts, these models are prone to learning simple co-occurrences. Recently, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive contextual understanding, yet they encounter challenges in adapting to specific information extraction (IE) tasks. In this paper, we propose a collaborative approach for CDECR, leveraging the capabilities of both a universally capable LLM and a task-specific SLM. The collaborative strategy begins with the LLM accurately and comprehensively summarizing events through prompting. Then, the SLM refines its learning of event representations based on these insights during fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses the performance of both the large and small language models individually, forming a complementary advantage. Across various datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness in diverse scenarios.",
    "Synergistic Interplay between Search and Large Language Models for Information Retrieval": "Information retrieval (IR) plays a crucial role in locating relevant resources from vast amounts of data, and its applications have evolved from traditional knowledge bases to modern retrieval models (RMs). The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further revolutionized the IR field by enabling users to interact with search systems in natural languages. In this paper, we explore the advantages and disadvantages of LLMs and RMs, highlighting their respective strengths in understanding user-issued queries and retrieving up-to-date information. To leverage the benefits of both paradigms while circumventing their limitations, we propose InteR, a novel framework that facilitates information refinement through synergy between RMs and LLMs. InteR allows RMs to expand knowledge in queries using LLM-generated knowledge collections and enables LLMs to enhance prompt formulation using retrieved documents. This iterative refinement process augments the inputs of RMs and LLMs, leading to more accurate retrieval. Experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks involving web search and low-resource retrieval tasks show that InteR achieves overall superior zero-shot retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, even those using relevance judgment.",
    "Synergizing Large Language Models and Pre-Trained Smaller Models for Conversational Intent Discovery": "In Conversational Intent Discovery (CID), Small Language Models (SLMs) struggle with overfitting to familiar intents and fail to label newly discovered ones. This issue stems from their limited grasp of semantic nuances and their intrinsically discriminative framework. Therefore, we propose Synergizing Large Language Models (LLMs) with pre-trained SLMs for CID (SynCID). It harnesses the profound semantic comprehension of LLMs alongside the operational agility of SLMs. By utilizing LLMs to refine both utterances and existing intent labels, SynCID significantly enhances the semantic depth, subsequently realigning these enriched descriptors within the SLMs' feature space to correct cluster distortion and promote robust learning of representations. A key advantage is its capacity for the early identification of new intents, a critical aspect for deploying conversational agents successfully. Additionally, SynCID leverages the in-context learning strengths of LLMs to generate labels for new intents. Thorough evaluations across a wide array of datasets have demonstrated its superior performance over traditional CID methods.",
    "SYNTAXSHAP: Syntax-aware Explainability Method for Text Generation": "To harness the power of large language models in safety-critical domains, we need to ensure the explainability of their predictions. However, despite the significant attention to model interpretability, there remains an unexplored domain in explaining sequence-to-sequence tasks using methods tailored for textual data. This paper introduces SyntaxShap, a local, model-agnostic explainability method for text generation that takes into consideration the syntax in the text data. The presented work extends Shapley values to account for parsing-based syntactic dependencies. Taking a game theoretic approach, SyntaxShap only considers coalitions constrained by the dependency tree. We adopt a model-based evaluation to compare SyntaxShap and its weighted form to state-of-the-art explainability methods adapted to text generation tasks, using diverse metrics including faithfulness, coherency, and semantic alignment of the explanations to the model. We show that our syntax-aware method produces explanations that help build more faithful and coherent explanations for predictions by autoregressive models. Confronted with the misalignment of human and AI model reasoning, this paper also highlights the need for cautious evaluation strategies in explainable AI.",
    "Synthesizing Text-to-SQL Data from Weak and Strong LLMs": "The capability gap between open-source and closed-source large language models (LLMs) remains challenging in text-to-SQL tasks. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic data approach that amalgamates strong data generated by larger, more potent models (strong models) with weak data produced by smaller, less well-aligned models (weak models). Our approach contributes to the improvement of domain generalization in text-to-SQL models and investigates the potential of weak data supervision through preference learning. Moreover, we utilize the synthetic data approach for instruction tuning on open-source LLMs, yielding SENSE, a specialized text-to-SQL model. The effectiveness of SENSE is substantiated by achieving state-of-the-art results on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks, thereby mitigating the performance disparity between open-source models and the methods derived from closed-source models.",
    "Synthetic Arabic Medical Dialogues Using Advanced Multi-Agent LLM Techniques": "The increasing use of artificial intelligence in healthcare requires robust datasets for training and validation, particularly in the domain of medical conversations. However, the creation and accessibility of such datasets in Arabic face significant challenges, especially due to the sensitivity and privacy concerns that are associated with medical conversations. These conversations are rarely recorded or preserved, making the availability of comprehensive Arabic medical dialogue datasets scarce. This limitation slows down not only the development of effective natural language processing models but also restricts the opportunity for open comparison of algorithms and their outcomes. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, GPT-4, Gemini-pro, and Claude-3 show promising capabilities in generating synthetic data. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Multi-Agent LLM approach capable of generating synthetic Arabic medical dialogues from patient notes, regardless of the original language. This development presents a significant step towards overcoming the barriers in dataset availability, enhancing the potential for broader research and application in AI-driven medical dialogue systems.",
    "Synthetic Context with LLM for Entity Linking from Scientific Tables": "Tables in scientific papers contain crucial information, such as experimental results. Entity Linking (EL) is a promising task that analyses tables and associates them with a knowledge base. EL for table cells requires identifying the referent concept of each cell while understanding the context relevant to each cell in the paper. However, extracting the relevant context from the paper is challenging because the relevant parts are scattered in the main text and captions. This study defines a rule-based method for extracting broad context from the main text, including table captions and sentences that mention the table. Furthermore, we propose synthetic context as a more refined context generated by large language models (LLMs). In a synthetic context, contexts from the entire paper are refined by summarizing, injecting supplemental knowledge, and clarifying the referent concept. We observe this approach improves accuracy for EL by more than 10 points on the S2abEL dataset, and our qualitative analysis suggests potential future works.",
    "Systematic Task Exploration with LLMs: A Study in Citation Text Generation": "Large language models (LLMs) bring unprecedented flexibility in defining and executing complex, creative natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Yet, this flexibility brings new challenges, as it introduces new degrees of freedom in formulating the task inputs and instructions and in evaluating model performance. To facilitate the exploration of creative NLG tasks, we propose a three-component research framework that consists of systematic input manipulation, reference data, and output measurement. We use this framework to explore citation text generation - a popular scholarly NLP task that lacks consensus on the task definition and evaluation metric and has not yet been tackled within the LLM paradigm. Our results highlight the importance of systematically investigating both task instruction and input configuration when prompting LLMs, and reveal non-trivial relationships between different evaluation metrics used for citation text generation. Additional human generation and human evaluation experiments provide new qualitative insights into the task to guide future research in citation text generation. We make our code and data publicly available.",
    "Sövereign at PerspectiveArg2024: Using LLMs with Argument Mining": "This paper presents the Sövereign submission for the shared task on perspective argument retrieval for the Argument Mining Workshop 2024 (Falk et al., 2024). To address the challenge, we apply open-access Large Language Models (Mistral-8x7b) in a zero-shot fashion for re-ranking and explicit similarity scoring. Additionally, we combine different features in an ensemble setup using logistic regression. Our system ranks second in the competition for all test set rounds on average for the logistic regression approach using LLM similarity scores as a feature. We also make the code publicly available.",
    "T-Eval: Evaluating the Tool Utilization Capability of Large Language Models Step by Step": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on various NLP tasks and are augmented by tools for broader applications. Yet, how to evaluate and analyze the tool utilization capability of LLMs is still under-explored. In contrast to previous works that evaluate models holistically, we comprehensively decompose the tool utilization into multiple sub-processes, including instruction following, planning, reasoning, retrieval, understanding, and review. Based on that, we further introduce T-Eval to evaluate the tool-utilization capability step by step. T-Eval disentangles the tool utilization evaluation into several sub-domains along model capabilities, facilitating the inner understanding of both holistic and isolated competency of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on T-Eval and in-depth analysis of various LLMs. T-Eval not only exhibits consistency with the outcome-oriented evaluation but also provides a more fine-grained analysis of the capabilities of LLMs, providing a new perspective in LLM evaluation on tool-utilization ability. The benchmark will be available at https://github.com/open-compass/T-Eval.",
    "T2S-GPT: Dynamic Vector Quantization for Autoregressive Sign Language Production from Text": "In this work, we propose a two-stage sign language production (SLP) paradigm that first encodes sign language sequences into discrete codes and then autoregressively generates sign language from text based on the learned codebook. However, existing vector quantization (VQ) methods are fixed-length encodings, overlooking the uneven information density in sign language, which leads to under-encoding of important regions and over-encoding of unimportant regions. To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic vector quantization (DVA-VAE) model that can dynamically adjust the encoding length based on the information density in sign language to achieve accurate and compact encoding. Then, a GPT-like model learns to generate code sequences and their corresponding durations from spoken language text. Extensive experiments conducted on the PHOENIX14T dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. To promote sign language research, we propose a new large German sign language dataset, PHOENIX-News, which contains 486 hours of sign language videos, audio, and transcription texts. Experimental analysis on PHOENIX-News shows that the performance of our model can be further improved by increasing the size of the training data.",
    "Tables as Texts or Images: Evaluating the Table Reasoning Ability of LLMs and MLLMs": "In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of various LLMs in interpreting tabular data through different prompting strategies and data formats. Our analyses extend across six benchmarks for table-related tasks such as question-answering and fact-checking. We introduce for the first time the assessment of LLMs' performance on image-based table representations. Specifically, we compare five text-based and three image-based table representations, demonstrating the role of representation and prompting on LLM performance. Our study provides insights into the effective use of LLMs on table-related tasks.",
    "Tailoring with Targeted Precision: Edit-Based Agents for Open-Domain Procedure Customization": "How-to procedures, such as how to plant a garden, are now used by millions of users, but sometimes need customizing to meet a user's specific needs, e.g., planting a garden without pesticides. Our goal is to measure and improve an LLM's ability to perform such customization. Our approach is to test several simple multi-LLM-agent architectures for customization, as well as an end-to-end LLM, using a new evaluation set, called CUSTOMPLANS, of over 200 WikiHow procedures each with a customization need. We find that a simple architecture with two LLM agents used sequentially performs best, one that edits a generic how-to procedure and one that verifies its executability, significantly outperforming (10.5% absolute) an end-to-end prompted LLM. This suggests that LLMs can be configured reasonably effectively for procedure customization. This also suggests that multi-agent editing architectures may be worth exploring further for other customization applications (e.g. coding, creative writing) in the future.",
    "Talk With Human-like Agents: Empathetic Dialogue Through Perceptible Acoustic Reception and Reaction": "Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced agents become increasingly prevalent in Human-AI communication, offering vast potential from entertainment to professional domains. However, current multi-modal dialogue systems overlook the acoustic information present in speech, which is crucial for understanding human communication nuances. This oversight can lead to misinterpretations of speakers' intentions, resulting in inconsistent or even contradictory responses within dialogues. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose PerceptiveAgent, an empathetic multi-modal dialogue system designed to discern deeper or more subtle meanings beyond the literal interpretations of words through the integration of speech modality perception. Employing LLMs as a cognitive core, PerceptiveAgent perceives acoustic information from input speech and generates empathetic responses based on speaking styles described in natural language. Experimental results indicate that PerceptiveAgent excels in contextual understanding by accurately discerning the speakers' true intentions in scenarios where the linguistic meaning is either contrary to or inconsistent with the speaker's true feelings, producing more nuanced and expressive spoken dialogues.",
    "TAO at StanceEval2024 Shared Task: Arabic Stance Detection using AraBERT": "In this paper, we present a high-performing model for Arabic stance detection on the STANCEEVAL2024 shared task part of ARABICNLP2024. Our model leverages ARABERTV1; a pre-trained Arabic language model, within a single-task learning framework. We fine-tuned the model on stance detection data for three specific topics: COVID-19 vaccine, digital transformation, and women empowerment, extracted from the MAWQIF corpus. In terms of performance, our model achieves 73.30 macro-F1 score for women empowerment, 70.51 for digital transformation, and 64.55 for COVID-19 vaccine detection.",
    "TAPERA: Enhancing Faithfulness and Interpretability in Long-Form Table QA by Content Planning and Execution-based Reasoning": "Long-form Table Question Answering (LFTQA) requires systems to generate paragraph long and complex answers to questions over tabular data. While Large language models based systems have made significant progress, it often hallucinates, especially when the task involves complex reasoning over tables. To tackle this issue, we propose a new LLM-based framework, TAPERA, for LFTQA tasks. Our framework uses a modular approach that decomposes the whole process into three sub-modules: 1) QA-based Content Planner that iteratively decomposes the input question into sub-questions; 2) Execution-based Table Reasoner that produces executable Python program for each sub-question; and 3) Answer Generator that generates long-form answer grounded on the program output. Human evaluation results on the FETAQA and QTSUMM datasets indicate that our framework significantly improves strong baselines on both accuracy and truthfulness, as our modular framework is better at table reasoning, and the long-form answer is always consistent with the program output. Our modular design further provides transparency as users are able to interact with our framework by manually changing the content plans.",
    "Task-Aligned Prompt for Predicting Empathy and Distress": "This paper describes our approach for the WASSA 2024 Shared Task on Empathy Detection and Emotion Classification and Personality Detection in Interactions at ACL 2024. We focused on Track 3: Empathy Prediction (EMP) which aims to predict the empathy and distress of writers based on their essays. Recently, LLMs have been used to detect the psychological status of the writers based on the texts. Previous studies showed that the performance of LLMs can be improved by designing prompts properly. While diverse approaches have been made, we focus on the fact that LLMs can have different nuances for psychological constructs such as empathy or distress to the specific task. In addition, people can express their empathy or distress differently according to the context. Thus, we tried to enhance the prediction performance of LLMs by proposing a new prompting strategy: Task-Aligned Prompt (TAP). This prompt consists of aligned definitions for empathy and distress to the original paper and the contextual information about the dataset. Our proposed prompt was tested using ChatGPT and GPT4o with zero-shot and few-shot settings and the performance was compared to the plain prompts. The results showed that the TAP-ChatGPT-zero-shot achieved the highest average Pearson correlation of empathy and distress on the EMP track.",
    "TASTE: Teaching Large Language Models to Translate through Self-Reflection": "Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks. Techniques like instruction tuning have effectively enhanced the proficiency of LLMs in the downstream task of machine translation. However, the existing approaches fail to yield satisfactory translation outputs that match the quality of supervised neural machine translation (NMT) systems. One plausible explanation for this discrepancy is that the straightforward prompts employed in these methodologies are unable to fully exploit the acquired instruction-following capabilities. To this end, we propose the TASTE framework, which stands for translating through self-reflection. The self-reflection process includes two stages of inference. In the first stage, LLMs are instructed to generate preliminary translations and conduct self-assessments on these translations simultaneously. In the second stage, LLMs are tasked to refine these preliminary translations according to the evaluation results. The evaluation results in four language directions on the WMT22 benchmark reveal the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing methods. Our work presents a promising approach to unleash the potential of LLMs and enhance their capabilities in MT. The codes and datasets are open-sourced at https://github.com/YutongWang1216/ReflectionLLMMT.",
    "TAXI: Evaluating Categorical Knowledge Editing for Language Models": "Humans rarely learn one fact in isolation. Instead, learning a new fact induces knowledge of other facts about the world. For example, in learning a korat is a type of cat, you also infer it is a mammal and has claws, ensuring your model of the world is consistent. Knowledge editing aims to inject new facts into language models to improve their factuality, but current benchmarks fail to evaluate consistency, which is critical to ensure efficient, accurate, and generalizable edits. We manually create TAXI, a new benchmark dataset specifically created to evaluate consistency in categorical knowledge edits. TAXI contains 11,120 multiple-choice queries for 976 edits spanning 41 categories (e.g., Dogs), 164 subjects (e.g., Labrador), and 183 properties (e.g., is a mammal). We then use TAXI to evaluate popular editors' categorical consistency, measuring how often editing a subject's category appropriately edits its properties. We find that 1) the editors achieve marginal, yet non-random consistency, 2) their consistency far underperforms human baselines, and 3) consistency is more achievable when editing atypical subjects.",
    "TaxoLLaMA: WordNet-based Model for Solving Multiple Lexical Semantic Tasks": "In this paper, we explore the capabilities of LLMs in capturing lexical-semantic knowledge from WordNet on the example of the LLaMA-2-7b model and test it on multiple lexical semantic tasks. As the outcome of our experiments, we present TaxoLLaMA, the “all-in-one” model for taxonomy-related tasks, lightweight due to 4-bit quantization and LoRA. TaxoLLaMA achieves 11 SOTA results, and 4 top-2 results out of 16 tasks on the Taxonomy Enrichment, Hypernym Discovery, Taxonomy Construction, and Lexical Entailment tasks. Moreover, it demonstrates a very strong zero-shot performance on Lexical Entailment and Taxonomy Construction with no fine-tuning. We also explore its hidden multilingual and domain adaptation capabilities with a little tuning or few-shot learning. All datasets, code, and pre-trained models are available online.",
    "Teacher-Student Training for Debiasing: General Permutation Debiasing for Large Language Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities and versatility in NLP tasks, however they sometimes fail to maintain crucial invariances for specific tasks. One example is permutation sensitivity, where LLMs' outputs may significantly vary depending on the order of the input options. While debiasing techniques can mitigate these issues, and yield better performance and reliability, they often come with a high computational cost at inference. This paper addresses this inefficiency at inference time. The aim is to distill the capabilities of a computationally intensive, debiased, teacher model into a more compact student model. We explore two variants of student models: one based on pure distillation, and the other on an error-correction approach for more complex tasks, where the student corrects a single biased decision from the teacher to achieve a debiased output. Our approach is general and can be applied to both black-box and white-box LLMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our compact, encoder-only student models can outperform their larger, biased teacher counterparts, achieving better results with significantly fewer parameters.",
    "Teaching Language Models to Self-Improve by Learning from Language Feedback": "Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intentions and values is crucial yet challenging. Current methods primarily rely on human preferences, which are costly and insufficient in capturing nuanced feedback expressed in natural language. In this paper, we present Self-Refinement Tuning (SRT), a method that leverages model feedback for alignment, thereby reducing reliance on human annotations. SRT uses a base language model (e.g., Tulu2) to generate initial responses, which are critiqued and refined by a more advanced model (e.g., GPT-4-Turbo). This process enables the base model to self-evaluate and improve its outputs, facilitating continuous learning. SRT further optimizes the model by learning from its self-generated feedback and refinements, creating a feedback loop that promotes model improvement. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that SRT significantly outperforms strong baselines across diverse tasks and model sizes. When applied to a 70B parameter model, SRT increases the win rate from 9.6% to 25.8% on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, surpassing well-established systems such as GPT-4-0314, Claude 2, and Gemini. Our analysis highlights the crucial role of language feedback in the success of SRT, suggesting potential for further exploration in this direction.",
    "Teaching Large Language Models an Unseen Language on the Fly": "Existing large language models struggle to support numerous low-resource languages, particularly the extremely low-resource ones, for which there is minimal training data available for effective parameter updating. We thus investigate whether LLMs can learn a new language on the fly solely through prompting. To study this question, we collect a research suite for Zhuang, a language supported by no LLMs currently. We introduce DIPMT++, a framework for adapting LLMs to unseen languages by in-context learning. Using a dictionary and 5K parallel sentences only, DIPMT++ significantly enhances the performance of GPT-4 from 0 to 16 BLEU for Chinese-to-Zhuang translation and achieves 32 BLEU for Zhuang-to-Chinese translation. We also validate the effectiveness of our framework on Kalamang, another unseen language. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of DIPMT++ in aiding humans in translating completely unseen languages, which could contribute to the preservation of linguistic diversity.",

    "Teaching Small Language Models to Reason for Knowledge-Intensive Multi-Hop Question Answering": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can teach small language models (SLMs) to solve complex reasoning tasks (e.g., mathematical question answering) by Chain-of-thought Distillation (CoTD). Specifically, CoTD fine-tunes SLMs by utilizing rationales generated from LLMs such as ChatGPT. However, CoTD has certain limitations that make it unsuitable for knowledge-intensive multi-hop question answering: 1) SLMs have a very limited capacity in memorizing required knowledge compared to LLMs. 2) SLMs do not possess the same powerful integrated abilities in question understanding and knowledge reasoning as LLMs. To address the above limitations, we introduce Decompose-and-Response Distillation (D&R Distillation), which distills two student models, namely Decomposer and Responser separately. The two models solve a knowledge-intensive multi-hop question through an interactive process of asking and answering sub-questions. Our method offers two advantages: 1) SLMs have the capability to access external knowledge to address subquestions, which provides more comprehensive knowledge for multi-hop questions. 2) By employing simpler subquestions instead of complex CoT reasoning, SLMs effectively mitigate task complexity and decrease data prerequisites. Experimental results on three knowledge-intensive multi-hop question answering datasets demonstrate that D&R Distillation can surpass previous CoTD methods, even with much less training data.",
    "Teaching-Assistant-in-the-Loop: Improving Knowledge Distillation from Imperfect Teacher Models in Low-Budget Scenarios": "There is increasing interest in distilling task-specific knowledge from large language models (LLM) to smaller student models. Nonetheless, LLM distillation presents a dual challenge: 1) there is a high cost associated with querying the teacher LLM, such as GPT-4, for gathering an ample number of demonstrations; 2) the teacher LLM might provide imperfect outputs with a negative impact on the student's learning process. To enhance sample efficiency within resource-constrained, imperfect teacher scenarios, we propose a three-component framework leveraging three signal types. The first signal is the student's self-consistency (consistency of student multiple outputs), which is a proxy of the student's confidence. Specifically, we introduce a “teaching assistant” (TA) model to assess the uncertainty of both the student's and the teacher's outputs via confidence scoring, which serves as another two signals for student training. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training schema to first warm up the student with a small proportion of data to better utilize student's signal. Experiments have shown the superiority of our proposed framework for four complex reasoning tasks. On average, our proposed two-stage framework brings a relative improvement of up to 20.79% compared to fine-tuning without any signals across datasets.",
    "Team YXZ at BioLaySumm: Adapting Large Language Models for Biomedical Lay Summarization": "Biomedical literature are crucial for disseminating new scientific findings. However, the complexity of these research articles often leads to misinterpretations by the public. To address this urgent issue, we participated in the BioLaySumm task at the 2024 ACL BioNLP workshop, which focuses on automatically simplifying technical biomedical articles for non-technical audiences. We conduct a systematic evaluation of the SOTA large language models (LLMs) in 2024 and found that LLMs can generally achieve better readability scores than smaller models like Bart. Then we iteratively developed techniques of title infusing, K-shot prompting, LLM rewriting and instruction fine-tuning to further boost readability while balancing factuality and relevance. Notably, our submission achieved the first place in readability at the workshop, and among the top-3 teams with the highest readability scores, we have the best overall rank. Here, we present our experiments and findings on how to effectively adapt LLMs for automatic biomedical lay summarization. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhoujieli/biolaysumm.",
    "TEII: Think, Explain, Interact and Iterate with Large Language Models to Solve Cross-lingual Emotion Detection": "Cross-lingual emotion detection allows us to analyze global trends, public opinion, and social phenomena at scale. We participated in the Explainability of Cross-lingual Emotion Detection (EXALT) shared task, achieving an F1-score of 0.6046 on the evaluation set for the emotion detection sub-task. Our system outperformed the baseline by more than 0.16 F1-score absolute, and ranked second amongst competing systems. We conducted experiments using fine-tuning, zero-shot learning, and few-shot learning for Large Language Model (LLM)-based models as well as embedding-based BiLSTM and KNN for non-LLM-based techniques. Additionally, we introduced two novel methods: the Multi-Iteration Agentic Workflow and the Multi-Binary-Classifier Agentic Workflow. We found that LLM-based approaches provided good performance on multilingual emotion detection. Furthermore, ensembles combining all our experimented models yielded higher F1-scores than any single approach alone.",
    "TeleChat: An Open-source Billingual Large Language Model": "In this paper, we present TeleChat, a collection of large language models (LLMs) with parameters of 7 billion and 12 billion. TeleChat is initially pretrained on an extensive corpus containing a diverse collection of texts from both English and Chinese languages, encompassing trillions of tokens. Subsequently, the model undergoes fine-tuning to align with human preferences, following a detailed methodology that we describe. We evaluate the performance of TeleChat on various tasks, including general dialogue generation, language understanding, mathematics, reasoning, code generation, and knowledge-based question answering. Our findings indicate that TeleChat achieves state-of-the-art performance to other open-source models of similar size across a wide range of public benchmarks. To support future research and applications utilizing LLMs, we release the fine-tuned model checkpoints of TeleChat-7B and TeleChat-12B, along with code and a portion of our filtered high-quality pretraining data, to the public community.",
    "Tell Me More! Towards Implicit User Intention Understanding of Language Model Driven Agents": "Current language model-driven agents often lack mechanisms for effective user participation, which is crucial given the vagueness commonly found in user instructions. Although adept at devising strategies and performing tasks, these agents struggle with seeking clarification and grasping precise user intentions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Intention-in-Interaction (IN3), a novel benchmark designed to inspect users' implicit intentions through explicit queries. Next, we propose the incorporation of model experts as the upstream in agent designs to enhance user-agent interaction. Employing IN3, we empirically train Mistral-Interact, a powerful model that proactively assesses task vagueness, inquires about user intentions, and refines them into actionable goals before starting downstream agent task execution. Integrating it into the XAgent framework, we comprehensively evaluate the enhanced agent system regarding user instruction understanding and execution, revealing that our approach notably excels at identifying vague user tasks, recovering and summarizing critical missing information, setting precise and necessary agent execution goals, and minimizing redundant tool usage, thus boosting overall efficiency. All the data and codes are released.",
    "TELLER: A Trustworthy Framework For Explainable, Generalizable and Controllable Fake News Detection": "The proliferation of fake news has emerged as a severe societal problem, raising significant interest from industry and academia. While existing deep-learning based methods have made progress in detecting fake news accurately, their reliability may be compromised caused by the non-transparent reasoning processes, poor generalization abilities and inherent risks of integration with large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we propose TELLER, a novel framework for trustworthy fake news detection that prioritizes explainability, generalizability and controllability of models. This is achieved via a dual-system framework that integrates cognition and decision systems, adhering to the principles above. The cognition system harnesses human expertise to generate logical predicates, which guide LLMs in generating human-readable logic atoms. Meanwhile, the decision system deduces generalizable logic rules to aggregate these atoms, enabling the identification of the truthfulness of the input news across diverse domains and enhancing transparency in the decision-making process. Finally, we present comprehensive evaluation results on four datasets, demonstrating the feasibility and trustworthiness of our proposed framework.",
    "TempCompass: Do Video LLMs Really Understand Videos?": "Recently, there is a surge in interest surrounding video large language models (Video LLMs). However, existing benchmarks fail to provide a comprehensive feedback on the temporal perception ability of Video LLMs. On the one hand, most of them are unable to distinguish between different temporal aspects (e.g., speed, direction) and thus cannot reflect the nuanced performance on these specific aspects. On the other hand, they are limited in the diversity of task formats (e.g., only multi-choice QA), which hinders the understanding of how temporal perception performance may vary across different types of tasks. Motivated by these two problems, we propose the TempCompass benchmark, which introduces a diversity of temporal aspects and task formats. To collect high-quality test data, we devise two novel strategies: (1) In video collection, we construct conflicting videos that share the same static content but differ in a specific temporal aspect, which prevents Video LLMs from leveraging single-frame bias or language priors. (2) To collect the task instructions, we propose a paradigm where humans first annotate meta-information for a video and then an LLM generates the instruction. We also design an LLM-based approach to automatically and accurately evaluate the responses from Video LLMs. Based on TempCompass, we comprehensively evaluate 9 state-of-the-art (SOTA) Video LLMs and 3 Image LLMs, and reveal the discerning fact that these models exhibit notably poor temporal perception ability. The data and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/llyx97/TempCompass.",
    "Temperature-scaling surprisal estimates improve fit to human reading times - but does it do so for the “right reasons”?": "A wide body of evidence shows that human language processing difficulty is predicted by the information-theoretic measure surprisal, a word's negative log probability in context. However, it is still unclear how to best estimate these probabilities needed for predicting human processing difficulty - while a long-standing belief held that models with lower perplexity would provide more accurate estimates of word predictability, and therefore lead to better reading time predictions, recent work has shown that for very large models, psycholinguistic predictive power decreases. One reason could be that language models might be more confident of their predictions than humans, because they have had exposure to several magnitudes more data. In this paper, we test what effect temperature-scaling of large language model (LLM) predictions has on surprisal estimates and their predictive power of reading times of English texts. Firstly, we show that calibration of large language models typically improves with model size, i.e. poorer calibration cannot account for poorer fit to reading times. Secondly, we find that temperature-scaling probabilities lead to a systematically better fit to reading times (up to 89% improvement in delta log likelihood), across several reading time corpora. Finally, we show that this improvement in fit is chiefly driven by words that are composed of multiple subword tokens.",
    "Temporal Knowledge Question Answering via Abstract Reasoning Induction": "In this study, we address the challenge of enhancing temporal knowledge reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs often struggle with this task, leading to the generation of inaccurate or misleading responses. This issue mainly arises from their limited ability to handle evolving factual knowledge and complex temporal logic. To overcome these limitations, we propose Abstract Reasoning Induction (ARI) framework, which divides temporal reasoning into two distinct phases: Knowledge-agnostic and Knowledge-based. This framework offers factual knowledge support to LLMs while minimizing the incorporation of extraneous noisy data. Concurrently, informed by the principles of constructivism, ARI provides LLMs the capability to engage in proactive, self-directed learning from both correct and incorrect historical reasoning samples. By teaching LLMs to actively construct knowledge and methods, it can significantly boost their temporal reasoning abilities. Our approach achieves significant improvements, with relative gains of 29.7% and 9.27% on two temporal QA datasets, underscoring its efficacy in advancing temporal reasoning in LLMs.",
    "Text Embedding Inversion Security for Multilingual Language Models": "Textual data is often represented as real-numbered embeddings in NLP, particularly with the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and Embeddings as a Service (EaaS). However, storing sensitive information as embeddings can be susceptible to security breaches, as research shows that text can be reconstructed from embeddings, even without knowledge of the underlying model. While defence mechanisms have been explored, these are exclusively focused on English, leaving other languages potentially exposed to attacks. This work explores LLM security through multilingual embedding inversion. We define the problem of black-box multilingual and cross-lingual inversion attacks, and explore their potential implications. Our findings suggest that multilingual LLMs may be more vulnerable to inversion attacks, in part because English-based defences may be ineffective. To alleviate this, we propose a simple masking defense effective for both monolingual and multilingual models. This study is the first to investigate multilingual inversion attacks, shedding light on the differences in attacks and defenses across monolingual and multilingual settings.",
    "Text-like Encoding of Collaborative Information in Large Language Models for Recommendation": "When adapting Large Language Models for Recommendation (LLMRec), it is crucial to integrate collaborative information. Existing methods achieve this by learning collaborative embeddings in LLMs' latent space from scratch or by mapping from external models. However, they fail to represent the information in a text-like format, which may not align optimally with LLMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce BinLLM, a novel LLMRec method that seamlessly integrates collaborative information through text-like encoding. BinLLM converts collaborative embeddings from external models into binary sequences — a specific text format that LLMs can understand and operate on directly, facilitating the direct usage of collaborative information in text-like format by LLMs. Additionally, BinLLM provides options to compress the binary sequence using dot-decimal notation to avoid excessively long lengths. Extensive experiments validate that BinLLM introduces collaborative information in a manner better aligned with LLMs, resulting in enhanced performance. We release our code at https://github.com/zyang1580/BinLLM.",
    "TEXT2DB : Integration-Aware Information Extraction with Large Language Model Agents": "The task of information extraction (IE) is to extract structured knowledge from text. However, it is often not straightforward to utilize IE output due to the mismatch between the IE ontology and the downstream application needs. We propose a new formulation of IE TEXT2DB that emphasizes the integration of IE output and the target database (or knowledge base). Given a user instruction, a document set, and a database, our task requires the model to update the database with values from the document set to satisfy the user instruction. This task requires understanding user instructions for what to extract and adapting to the given DB/KB schema for how to extract on the fly. To evaluate this new task, we introduce a new benchmark featuring common demands such as data infilling, row population, and column addition. In addition, we propose an LLM agent framework OPAL (Observe-Plan-Analyze LLM) which includes an Observer component that interacts with the database, the Planner component that generates a code-based plan with calls to IE models, and the Analyzer component that provides feedback regarding code quality before execution. Experiments show that OPAL can successfully adapt to diverse database schemas by generating different code plans and calling the required IE models. We also highlight difficult cases such as dealing with large databases with complex dependencies and extraction hallucination, which we believe deserve further investigation.",
    "TEXTBIND: Multi-turn Interleaved Multimodal Instruction-following in the Wild": "Large language models with instruction-following abilities have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. These models show exceptional generalizability to tackle various real-world tasks through their natural language interfaces. However, their performance heavily relies on high-quality exemplar data, which is often difficult to obtain. This challenge is further exacerbated when it comes to multi-modal instruction following. We introduce TEXTBIND, an almost annotation-free framework for empowering LLMs with multi-turn interleaved multimodal instruction-following capabilities. Our approach requires only image-caption pairs and generates multi-turn multimodal instruction-response conversations from a language model. To accommodate interleaved image-text inputs and outputs, we devise MIM, a language model-centric architecture that seamlessly integrates image encoder and decoder models. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MIM trained on TEXTBIND achieves remarkable generation capability in multimodal conversations compared to recent baselines.",
    "TEXTEE: Benchmark, Reevaluation, Reflections, and Future Challenges in Event Extraction": "Event extraction has gained considerable interest due to its wide-ranging applications. However, recent studies draw attention to evaluation issues, suggesting that reported scores may not accurately reflect the true performance. In this work, we identify and address evaluation challenges, including inconsistency due to varying data assumptions or preprocessing steps, the insufficiency of current evaluation frameworks that may introduce dataset or data split bias, and the low reproducibility of some previous approaches. To address these challenges, we present TEXTEE, a standardized, fair, and reproducible benchmark for event extraction. TEXTEE comprises standardized data preprocessing scripts and splits for 16 datasets spanning eight diverse domains and includes 14 recent methodologies, conducting a comprehensive benchmark reevaluation. We also evaluate five varied large language models on our TEXTEE benchmark and demonstrate how they struggle to achieve satisfactory performance. Inspired by our reevaluation results and findings, we discuss the role of event extraction in the current NLP era, as well as future challenges and insights derived from TEXTEE. We believe TEXTEE, the first standardized comprehensive benchmarking tool, will significantly facilitate future event extraction research.",
    "TextGenSHAP: Scalable Post-hoc Explanations in Text Generation with Long Documents": "Large language models (LLMs) have attracted great interest in many real-world applications; however, their black-box nature necessitates scalable and faithful explanations. Shapley values have matured as an explainability method for deep learning, but extending them to LLMs is difficult due to long input contexts and autoregressive output generation. We introduce TextGenSHAP, an efficient post-hoc explanation method incorporating LLM-specific techniques, which leads to significant runtime improvements: token-level explanations in minutes not hours, and document-level explanations within seconds. We demonstrate how such explanations can improve end-to-end performance of retrieval augmented generation by localizing important words within long documents and reranking passages collected by retrieval systems. On various open-domain question answering benchmarks, we show TextGenSHAP improves the retrieval recall and prediction accuracy significantly.",
    "TextGraphs 2024 Shared Task on Text-Graph Representations for Knowledge Graph Question Answering": "This paper describes the results of the Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) shared task that was co-located with the TextGraphs 2024 workshop. In this task, given a textual question and a list of entities with the corresponding KG subgraphs, the participating system should choose the entity that correctly answers the question. Our competition attracted thirty teams, four of which outperformed our strong ChatGPT-based zero-shot baseline. In this paper, we overview the participating systems and analyze their performance according to a large-scale automatic evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first competition aimed at the KGQA problem using the interaction between large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs.",
    "ThangDLU at #SMM4H 2024: Encoder-decoder models for classifying text data on social disorders in children and adolescents": "This paper describes our participation in Task 3 and Task 5 of the #SMM4H (Social Media Mining for Health) 2024 Workshop, explicitly targeting the classification challenges within tweet data. Task 3 is a multi-class classification task centered on tweets discussing the impact of outdoor environments on symptoms of social anxiety. Task 5 involves a binary classification task focusing on tweets reporting medical disorders in children. We applied transfer learning from pre-trained encoder-decoder models such as BART-base and T5-small to identify the labels of a set of given tweets. We also presented some data augmentation methods to see their impact on the model performance. Finally, the systems obtained the best F1 score of 0.627 in Task 3 and the best F1 score of 0.87 in Task 5.",
    "That's Optional: A Contemporary Exploration of that Omission in English Subordinate Clauses": "The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis posits that speakers optimize the communicative properties of their utterances by avoiding spikes in information, thereby maintaining a relatively uniform information profile over time. This paper investigates the impact of UID principles on syntactic reduction, specifically focusing on the optional omission of the connector that in English subordinate clauses. Building upon previous research, we extend our investigation to a larger corpus of written English, utilize contemporary large language models (LLMs) and extend the information-uniformity principles by the notion of entropy, to estimate the UID manifestations in the use-case of syntactic reduction choices.",
    "The Art of Defending: A Systematic Evaluation and Analysis of LLM Defense Strategies on Safety and Over-Defensiveness": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) play an increasingly pivotal role in natural language processing applications, their safety concerns become critical areas of NLP research. This has resulted in the development of various LLM defense strategies. Unfortunately, despite the shared goal of improving the safety of LLMs, the evaluation suites across various research works are disjoint and lack diverse inputs to ensure accurate and precise evaluation estimates. Furthermore, the important factor of 'over-defensiveness' on the safe inputs has largely remained overlooked. Addressing these limitations, this paper presents a systematic evaluation, comparison, and analysis of various LLM defense strategies over both 'safety' and 'over-defensiveness'. To this end, we compile a large and diverse collection of safe and unsafe prompts, design precise evaluation methodology, and study the efficacy of various LLM defense strategies on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our work reveals a number of crucial findings that we believe will pave the way and also facilitate further research in the critical area of improving the safety of LLMs.",
    "The BELEBELE Benchmark: a Parallel Reading Comprehension Dataset in 122 Language Variants": "We present BELEBELE, a multiple-choice machine reading comprehension (MRC) dataset spanning 122 language variants. Significantly expanding the language coverage of natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks, this dataset enables the evaluation of text models in high-, medium-, and low-resource languages. Each question is based on a short passage from the FLORES-200 dataset and has four multiple-choice answers. The questions were carefully curated to discriminate between models with different levels of general language comprehension. The English dataset on its own proves difficult enough to challenge state-of-the-art language models. Being fully parallel, this dataset enables direct comparison of model performance across all languages. We use this dataset to evaluate the capabilities of multilingual masked language models (MLMs) and large language models (LLMs). We present extensive results and findings, notably that despite significant cross-lingual transfer in English-centric LLMs, much smaller MLMs pretrained on balanced multilingual data still understand far more languages. Overall, BELEBELE opens up new avenues for evaluating and analyzing the multilingual capabilities of NLP systems.",
    "The Butterfly Effect of Altering Prompts: How Small Changes and Jailbreaks Affect Large Language Model Performance": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are regularly being used to label data across many domains and for myriad tasks. By simply asking the LLM for an answer, or “prompting,” practitioners are able to use LLMs to quickly get a response for an arbitrary task. This prompting is done through a series of decisions by the practitioner, from simple wording of the prompt, to requesting the output in a certain data format, to jailbreaking in the case of prompts that address more sensitive topics. In this work we ask: do variations in the way a prompt is constructed change the ultimate decision of the LLM? We answer this using a series of prompt variations across a variety of text classification tasks. We find that even the smallest of perturbations, such as adding a space at the end of a prompt, can cause the LLM to change its answer. Further, we find that requesting responses in XML and commonly-used jailbreaks can have cataclysmic effects on the data labeled by LLMs.",
    "The Butterfly Effect of Model Editing: Few Edits Can Trigger Large Language Models Collapse": "Although model editing has shown promise in revising knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), its impact on the inherent capabilities of LLMs is often overlooked. In this work, we reveal a critical phenomenon: even a single edit can trigger model collapse, manifesting as significant performance degradation in various benchmark tasks. However, benchmarking LLMs after each edit, while necessary to prevent such collapses, is impractically time-consuming and resource-intensive. To mitigate this, we propose using perplexity as a surrogate metric, validated by extensive experiments demonstrating changes in an edited model's perplexity are strongly correlated with its downstream task performances. We further conduct an in-depth study on sequential editing, a practical setting for real-world scenarios, across various editing methods and LLMs, focusing on hard cases from our previous single edit studies. The results indicate that nearly all examined editing methods result in model collapse after only few edits. To facilitate further research, we have utilized GPT-3.5 to develop a new dataset, HardEdit, based on those hard cases. This dataset aims to establish the foundation for pioneering research in reliable model editing and the mechanisms underlying editing-induced model collapse. We hope this work can draw the community's attention to the potential risks inherent in model editing practices.",
    "The Counterfeit Conundrum: Can Code Language Models Grasp the Nuances of Their Incorrect Generations?": "While language models are increasingly more proficient at code generation, they still frequently generate incorrect programs. Many of these programs are obviously wrong, but others are more subtle and pass weaker correctness checks such as being able to compile. In this work, we focus on these counterfeit samples: programs sampled from a language model that 1) have a high enough log-probability to be generated at a moderate temperature and 2) pass weak correctness checks. Overall, we discover that most models have a very shallow understanding of counterfeits through three clear failure modes. First, models mistakenly classify them as correct. Second, models are worse at reasoning about the execution behaviour of counterfeits and often predict their execution results as if they were correct. Third, when asking models to fix counterfeits, the likelihood of a model successfully repairing a counterfeit is often even lower than that of sampling a correct program from scratch. Counterfeits also have very unexpected properties: first, counterfeit programs for problems that are easier for a model to solve are not necessarily easier to detect and only slightly easier to execute and repair. Second, counterfeits from a given model are just as confusing to the model itself as they are to other models. Finally, both strong and weak models are able to generate counterfeit samples that equally challenge all models. In light of our findings, we recommend that care and caution be taken when relying on models to understand their own samples, especially when no external feedback is incorporated.",
    "The Critique of Critique": "Critique, as a natural language description for assessing the quality of model-generated content, has played a vital role in the training, evaluation, and refinement of LLMs. However, a systematic method to evaluate the quality of critique is lacking. In this paper, we pioneer the critique of critique, termed METACRITIQUE, which builds specific quantification criteria. To achieve a reliable evaluation outcome, we propose Atomic Information Units (AIUs), which describe the critique in a more fine-grained manner. METACRITIQUE aggregates each AIU's judgment for the overall score. Moreover, METACRITIQUE delivers a natural language rationale for the intricate reasoning within each judgment. Lastly, we construct a meta-evaluation dataset covering 4 tasks across 16 public datasets involving human-written and LLM-generated critiques. Experiments demonstrate that METACRITIQUE can achieve near-human performance. Our study can facilitate future research in LLM critiques based on our following observations and released resources: (1) superior critiques judged by METACRITIQUE can lead to better refinements, indicating that it can potentially enhance the alignment of existing LLMs; (2) the leaderboard of critique models reveals that open-source critique models commonly suffer from factuality issues; (3) relevant code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/MetaCritique to support deeper exploration; (4) an API at PyPI with the usage documentation in Appendix C allows users to assess the critique conveniently.",
    "The Dawn After the Dark: An Empirical Study on Factuality Hallucination in Large Language Models": "In the era of large language models (LLMs), hallucination (i.e., the tendency to generate factually incorrect content) poses great challenges to trustworthy and reliable deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. To tackle the hallucination, three key questions should be well studied: how to detect hallucinations (detection), why do LLMs hallucinate (source), and what can be done to mitigate them (mitigation). To address these challenges, this work presents a systematic empirical study on LLM hallucinations, focused on the three aspects of hallucination detection, source and mitigation. Specially, we construct a new hallucination benchmark HaluEval 2.0, and design a simple yet effective detection method for LLM hallucinations. Furthermore, we zoom into the different training or utilization stages of LLMs and extensively analyze the potential factors that lead to the LLM hallucinations. Finally, we implement and examine a series of widely used techniques to mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs. Our work has led to several important findings to understand the hallucination origin and mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs. Our code and data can be accessed at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/HaluEval-2.0.",
    "The Earth is Flat because...: Investigating LLMs' Belief towards Misinformation via Persuasive Conversation": "Large language models (LLMs) encapsulate vast amounts of knowledge but still remain vulnerable to external misinformation. Existing research mainly studied this susceptibility behavior in a single-turn setting. However, belief can change during a multi-turn conversation, especially a persuasive one. Therefore, in this study, we delve into LLMs' susceptibility to persuasive conversations, particularly on factual questions that they can answer correctly. We first curate the Farm (i.e., Fact to Misinform) dataset, which contains factual questions paired with systematically generated persuasive misinformation. Then, we develop a testing framework to track LLMs' belief changes in a persuasive dialogue. Through extensive experiments, we find that LLMs' correct beliefs on factual knowledge can be easily manipulated by various persuasive strategies.",
    "The Echoes of Multilinguality: Tracing Cultural Value Shifts during LM Fine-tuning": "Texts written in different languages reflect different culturally-dependent beliefs of their writers. Thus, we expect multilingual LMs (MLMs), that are jointly trained on a concatenation of text in multiple languages, to encode different cultural values for each language. Yet, as the 'multilinguality' of these LMs is driven by cross-lingual sharing, we also have reason to believe that cultural values bleed over from one language into another. This limits the use of MLMs in practice, as apart from being proficient in generating text in multiple languages, creating language technology that can serve a community also requires the output of LMs to be sensitive to their biases (Naous et al., 2023). Yet, little is known about how cultural values emerge and evolve in MLMs (Hershcovich et al., 2022a). We are the first to study how languages can exert influence on the cultural values encoded for different test languages, by studying how such values are revised during fine-tuning. Focusing on the fine-tuning stage allows us to study the interplay between value shifts when exposed to new linguistic experience from different data sources and languages. Lastly, we use a training data attribution method to find patterns in the fine-tuning examples, and the languages that they come from, that tend to instigate value shifts.",
    "The Fine-Tuning Paradox: Boosting Translation Quality Without Sacrificing LLM Abilities": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for machine translation has shown improvements in overall translation quality. However, it is unclear what is the impact of fine-tuning on desirable LLM behaviors that are not present in neural machine translation models, such as steerability, inherent document-level translation abilities, and the ability to produce less literal translations. We perform an extensive translation evaluation on the LLaMA and Falcon family of models with model size ranging from 7 billion up to 65 billion parameters. Our results show that while fine-tuning improves the general translation quality of LLMs, several abilities degrade. In particular, we observe a decline in the ability to perform formality steering, to produce technical translations through few-shot examples, and to perform document-level translation. On the other hand, we observe that the model produces less literal translations after fine-tuning on parallel data. We show that by including monolingual data as part of the fine-tuning data we can maintain the abilities while simultaneously enhancing overall translation quality. Our findings emphasize the need for fine-tuning strategies that preserve the benefits of LLMs for machine translation.",

    "The Good and The Bad: Exploring Privacy Issues in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful technique to facilitate language model with proprietary and private data, where data privacy is a pivotal concern. Whereas extensive research has demonstrated the privacy risks of large language models (LLMs), the RAG technique could potentially reshape the inherent behaviors of LLM generation, posing new privacy issues that are currently under-explored. In this work, we conduct extensive empirical studies with novel attack methods, which demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG systems on leaking the private retrieval database. Despite the new risk brought by RAG on the retrieval data, we further reveal that RAG can mitigate the leakage of the LLMs' training data. Overall, we provide new insights in this paper for privacy protection of retrieval-augmented LLMs, which benefit both LLMs and RAG systems builders. Our code is available at https://github.com/phycholosogy/RAG-privacy.",
    "The Heuristic Core: Understanding Subnetwork Generalization in Pretrained Language Models": "Prior work has found that pretrained language models (LMs) fine-tuned with different random seeds can achieve similar in-domain performance but generalize differently on tests of syntactic generalization. In this work, we show that, even within a single model, we can find multiple subnetworks that perform similarly in-domain, but generalize vastly differently. To better understand these phenomena, we investigate if they can be understood in terms of “competing subnetworks”: the model initially represents a variety of distinct algorithms, corresponding to different subnetworks, and generalization occurs when it ultimately converges to one. This explanation has been used to account for generalization in simple algorithmic tasks (“grokking”). Instead of finding competing subnetworks, we find that all subnetworks—whether they generalize or not—share a set of attention heads, which we refer to as the heuristic core. Further analysis suggests that these attention heads emerge early in training and compute shallow, non-generalizing features. The model learns to generalize by incorporating additional attention heads, which depend on the outputs of the “heuristic” heads to compute higher-level features. Overall, our results offer a more detailed picture of the mechanisms for syntactic generalization in pretrained LMs.",
    "The Hidden Space of Transformer Language Adapters": "We analyze the operation of transformer language adapters, which are small modules trained on top of a frozen language model to adapt its predictions to new target languages. We show that adapted predictions mostly evolve in the source language the model was trained on, while the target language becomes pronounced only in the very last layers of the model. Moreover, the adaptation process is gradual and distributed across layers, where it is possible to skip small groups of adapters without decreasing adaptation performance. Last, we show that adapters operate on top of the model's frozen representation space while largely preserving its structure, rather than on an “isolated” subspace. Our findings provide a deeper view into the adaptation process of language models to new languages, showcasing the constraints imposed on it by the underlying model and introduces practical implications to enhance its efficiency.",
    "The Impact of Demonstrations on Multilingual In-Context Learning: A Multidimensional Analysis": "In-context learning is a popular inference strategy where large language models solve a task using only a few labeled demonstrations without needing any parameter updates. Although there have been extensive studies on English in-context learning, multilingual in-context learning remains under-explored, and we lack an in-depth understanding of the role of demonstrations in this context. To address this gap, we conduct a multidimensional analysis of multilingual in-context learning, experimenting with 5 models from different model families, 9 datasets covering classification and generation tasks, and 56 typologically diverse languages. Our results reveal that the effectiveness of demonstrations varies significantly across models, tasks, and languages. We also find that strong instruction-following models including Llama 2-Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 are largely insensitive to the quality of demonstrations. Instead, a carefully crafted template often eliminates the benefits of demonstrations for some tasks and languages altogether. These findings show that the importance of demonstrations might be overestimated. Our work highlights the need for granular evaluation across multiple axes towards a better understanding of in-context learning.",
    "The Impact of Reasoning Step Length on Large Language Models": "Chain of Thought (CoT) is significant in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the correlation between the effectiveness of CoT and the length of reasoning steps in prompts remains largely unknown. To shed light on this, we have conducted several empirical experiments to explore the relations. Specifically, we design experiments that expand and compress the rationale reasoning steps within CoT demonstrations while keeping all other factors constant. We have the following key findings. First, the results indicate that lengthening the reasoning steps in prompts, even without adding new information into the prompt, considerably enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities across multiple datasets. Alternatively, shortening the reasoning steps, even while preserving the key information, significantly diminishes the reasoning abilities of models. This finding highlights the importance of the number of steps in CoT prompts and provides practical guidance to make better use of LLMs' potential in complex problem-solving scenarios. Second, we also investigated the relationship between the performance of CoT and the rationales used in demonstrations. Surprisingly, the result shows that even incorrect rationales can yield favorable outcomes if they maintain the requisite length of inference. Third, we observed that the advantages of increasing reasoning steps are task-dependent: simpler tasks require fewer steps, whereas complex tasks gain significantly from longer inference sequences.",
    "The Knowledge Alignment Problem: Bridging Human and External Knowledge for Large Language Models": "Large language models often necessitate grounding on external knowledge to generate faithful and reliable answers. Yet even with the correct groundings in the reference, they can ignore them and rely on wrong groundings or their inherent biases to hallucinate when users, being largely unaware of the specifics of the stored information, pose questions that might not directly correlate with the retrieved groundings. In this work, we formulate this knowledge alignment problem and introduce MIXALIGN, a framework that interacts with both the human user and the knowledge base to obtain and integrate clarifications on how the user question relates to the stored information. MIXALIGN employs a language model to achieve automatic knowledge alignment and, if necessary, further enhances this alignment through human user clarifications. Experimental results highlight the crucial role of knowledge alignment in boosting model performance and mitigating hallucination, with improvements noted up to 22.2% and 27.1% respectively. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of MIXALIGN in improving knowledge alignment by producing high-quality, user-centered clarifications.",
    "The Language Barrier: Dissecting Safety Challenges of LLMs in Multilingual Contexts": "As the influence of large language models (LLMs) spans across global communities, their safety challenges in multilingual settings become paramount for alignment research. This paper examines the variations in safety challenges faced by LLMs across different languages and discusses approaches to alleviating such concerns. By comparing how state-of-the-art LLMs respond to the same set of malicious prompts written in higher- vs. lower-resource languages, we observe that (1) LLMs tend to generate unsafe responses much more often when a malicious prompt is written in a lower-resource language, and (2) LLMs tend to generate more irrelevant responses to malicious prompts in lower-resource languages. To understand where the discrepancy can be attributed, we study the effect of instruction tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or supervised finetuning (SFT) on the HH-RLHF dataset. Surprisingly, while training with high-resource languages improves model alignment, training in lower-resource languages yields minimal improvement. This suggests that the bottleneck of cross-lingual alignment is rooted in the pre-training stage. Our findings highlight the challenges in cross-lingual LLM safety, and we hope they inform future research in this direction.",
    "The Model Arena for Cross-lingual Sentiment Analysis: A Comparative Study in the Era of Large Language Models": "Sentiment analysis serves as a pivotal component in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Advancements in multilingual pre-trained models such as XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) and mT5 (Xue et al., 2021) have contributed to the increasing interest in cross-lingual sentiment analysis. The recent emergence in Large Language Models (LLM) has significantly advanced general NLP tasks, however, the capability of such LLMs in cross-lingual sentiment analysis has not been fully studied. This work undertakes an empirical analysis to compare the cross-lingual transfer capability of public Small Multilingual Language Models (SMLM) like XLM-R, against English-centric LLMs such as Llama-3 (AI@Meta, 2024), in the context of sentiment analysis across English, Spanish, French and Chinese. Our findings reveal that among public models, SMLMs exhibit superior zero-shot cross-lingual performance relative to LLMs. However, in few-shot cross-lingual settings, public LLMs demonstrate an enhanced adaptive potential. In addition, we observe that proprietary GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2024) lead in zero-shot cross-lingual capability, but are outpaced by public models in few-shot scenarios.",
    "The Music Maestro or The Musically Challenged, A Massive Music Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models": "Benchmark plays a pivotal role in assessing the advancements of large language models (LLMs). While numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities, there is a notable absence of a dedicated benchmark for assessing their musical abilities. To address this gap, we present ZIQI-Eval, a comprehensive and large-scale music benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the music-related capabilities of LLMs. ZIQI-Eval encompasses a wide range of questions, covering 10 major categories and 56 subcategories, resulting in over 14,000 meticulously curated data entries. By leveraging ZIQI-Eval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation over 16 LLMs to evaluate and analyze LLMs' performance in the domain of music. Results indicate that all LLMs perform poorly on the ZIQI-Eval benchmark, suggesting significant room for improvement in their musical capabilities. With ZIQI-Eval, we aim to provide a standardized and robust evaluation framework that facilitates a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' music-related abilities. The dataset is available at GitHub1 and HuggingFace2.",
    "The power of Prompts: Evaluating and Mitigating Gender Bias in MT with LLMs": "This paper studies gender bias in machine translation through the lens of Large Language Models (LLMs). Four widely-used test sets are employed to benchmark various base LLMs, comparing their translation quality and gender bias against state-of-the-art Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for English to Catalan (En →Ca) and English to Spanish (En →Es) translation directions. Our findings reveal pervasive gender bias across all models, with base LLMs exhibiting a higher degree of bias compared to NMT models. To combat this bias, we explore prompting engineering techniques applied to an instruction-tuned LLM. We identify a prompt structure that significantly reduces gender bias by up to 12% on the WinoMT evaluation dataset compared to more straightforward prompts. These results significantly reduce the gender bias accuracy gap between LLMs and traditional NMT systems.",
    "The Probabilities Also Matter: A More Faithful Metric for Faithfulness of Free-Text Explanations in Large Language Models": "In order to oversee advanced AI systems, it is important to understand their underlying decision-making process. When prompted, large language models (LLMs) can provide natural language explanations or reasoning traces that sound plausible and receive high ratings from human annotators. However, it is unclear to what extent these explanations are faithful, i.e., truly capture the factors responsible for the model's predictions. In this work, we introduce Correlational Explanatory Faithfulness (CEF), a metric that can be used in faithfulness tests based on input interventions. Previous metrics used in such tests take into account only binary changes in the predictions. Our metric accounts for the total shift in the model's predicted label distribution, more accurately reflecting the explanations' faithfulness. We then introduce the Correlational Counterfactual Test (CCT) by instantiating CEF on the Counterfactual Test (CT) from Atanasova et al. (2023). We evaluate the faithfulness of free-text explanations generated by few-shot-prompted LLMs from the Llama2 family on three NLP tasks. We find that our metric measures aspects of faithfulness which the CT misses.",
    "The Revolution of Multimodal Large Language Models: A Survey": "Connecting text and visual modalities plays an essential role in generative intelligence. For this reason, inspired by the success of large language models, significant research efforts are being devoted to the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). These models can seamlessly integrate visual and textual modalities, while providing a dialogue-based interface and instruction-following capabilities. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of recent visual-based MLLMs, analyzing their architectural choices, multimodal alignment strategies, and training techniques. We also conduct a detailed analysis of these models across a wide range of tasks, including visual grounding, image generation and editing, visual understanding, and domain-specific applications. Additionally, we compile and describe training datasets and evaluation benchmarks, conducting comparisons among existing models in terms of performance and computational requirements. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art, laying the groundwork for future MLLMs.",
    "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Easy Training Data for Hard Tasks": "How can we train models to perform well on hard test data when hard training data is by definition difficult to label correctly? This question has been termed the scalable oversight problem and has drawn increasing attention as language models have continually improved. In this paper, we present the surprising conclusion that current pretrained language models often generalize relatively well from easy to hard data, even performing as well as oracle models fine-tuned on hard data. We demonstrate this kind of easy-to-hard generalization using simple fine-tuning methods like in-context learning, linear classifier heads, and QLoRA for seven different measures of datapoint hardness, including six empirically diverse human hardness measures (like grade level) and one model-based measure (loss-based). Furthermore, we show that even if one cares most about model performance on hard data, it can be better to collect easy data rather than hard data for finetuning, since hard data is generally noisier and costlier to collect. Our experiments use open models up to 70b in size and four publicly available question-answering datasets with questions ranging in difficulty from 3rd grade science questions to college level STEM questions and general-knowledge trivia. We conclude that easy-to-hard generalization in LMs is surprisingly strong for the tasks studied.",
    "Think Twice: Perspective-Taking Improves Large Language Models' Theory-of-Mind Capabilities": "Human interactions are deeply rooted in the interplay of thoughts, beliefs, and desires made possible by Theory of Mind (ToM): our cognitive ability to understand the mental states of ourselves and others. Although ToM may come naturally to us, emulating it presents a challenge to even the most advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent improvements to LLMs' reasoning capabilities from simple yet effective prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) have seen limited applicability to ToM (Gandhi et al., 2023).  In this paper, we turn to the prominent cognitive science theory “Simulation Theory” to bridge this gap. We introduce SIMTOM, a novel two-stage prompting framework inspired by Simulation Theory's notion of perspective-taking. To implement this idea on current ToM benchmarks, SIMTOM first filters context based on what the character in question knows before answering a question about their mental state. Our approach, which requires no additional training and minimal prompt-tuning, shows substantial improvement over existing methods, and our analysis reveals the importance of perspective-taking to Theory-of-Mind capabilities. Our findings suggest perspective-taking as a promising direction for future research into improving LLMs' ToM capabilities. Our code is publicly available.",
    "Thinking about how to extract: Energizing LLMs' emergence capabilities for document-level event argument extraction": "There are two key challenges remaining for the document-level event argument extraction (D-EAE) tasks: key feature forgetting and cross-event argument confusion. The emergence capability of large language models (LLMs) holds promise for solving the above two challenges. In this paper, we propose a document-level event argument extraction method based on guided summarization and reasoning (EAESR), which leverages the emergence capabilities of LLMs to highlight key event information and to clarify the explicit and implicit association between multiple events. Specifically, we generate document summarization information that shortens the length of the event context while preserving the key event features. In addition, we generate inter-event reasoning information, which helps EAESR make sense of the correlations between events and reduces their dependence on the event context, especially to better cope with the few-shot D-EAE task. Then, we obtain named entity information to enable EAESR to learn argument boundary features to improve the sensitivity of its argument boundary recognition. Eventually, we fused the above features and sentence features to make EAESR have summarizing and reasoning capabilities simultaneously. Extensive experiments on WIKIEVENTS and RAMS have shown that EAESR achieves a new state-of-the-art that outperforms the baseline models by 1.3% F1 and 1.6% F1, respectively, and averages 11% F1 in few-shot settings.",
    "Threads of Subtlety: Detecting Machine-Generated Texts Through Discourse Motifs": "With the advent of large language models (LLM), the line between human-crafted and machine-generated texts has become increasingly blurred. This paper delves into the inquiry of identifying discernible and unique linguistic properties in texts that were written by humans, particularly uncovering the underlying discourse structures of texts beyond their surface structures. Introducing a novel methodology, we leverage hierarchical parse trees and recursive hypergraphs to unveil distinctive discourse patterns in texts produced by both LLMs and humans. Empirical findings demonstrate that, although both LLMs and humans generate distinct discourse patterns influenced by specific domains, human-written texts exhibit more structural variability, reflecting the nuanced nature of human writing in different domains. Notably, incorporating hierarchical discourse features enhances binary classifiers' overall performance in distinguishing between human-written and machine-generated texts, even on out-of-distribution and paraphrased samples. This underscores the significance of incorporating hierarchical discourse features in the analysis of text patterns. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/minnesotanlp/threads-of-subtlety.",
    "Time is Encoded in the Weights of Finetuned Language Models": "We present time vectors, a simple tool to customize language models to new time periods. Time vectors are created by finetuning a language model on data from a single time (e.g., a year or month), and then subtracting the weights of the original pretrained model. This vector specifies a direction in weight space that, as our experiments show, improves performance on text from that time period. Time vectors specialized to adjacent time periods appear to be positioned closer together in a manifold. Using this structure, we interpolate between time vectors to induce new models that perform better on intervening and future time periods, without any additional training. We demonstrate the consistency of our findings across different tasks, domains, model sizes, and time scales. Our results suggest that time is encoded in the weight space of finetuned models.",
    "Time Sensitive Knowledge Editing through Efficient Finetuning": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capability in different tasks and are bringing transformative changes to many domains. However, keeping the knowledge in LLMs up-to-date remains a challenge once pretraining is complete. It is thus essential to design effective methods to both update obsolete knowledge and induce new knowledge into LLMs. Existing locate-and-edit knowledge editing (KE) method suffers from two limitations. First, the post-edit LLMs by such methods generally have poor capability in answering complex queries that require multi-hop reasoning (Zhong et al., 2023). Second, the long run-time of such locate-and-edit methods to perform knowledge edits make it infeasible for large scale KE in practice. In this paper, we explore Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques as an alternative for KE. We curate a more comprehensive temporal KE dataset with both knowledge update and knowledge injection examples for KE performance benchmarking1. We further probe the effect of fine-tuning on a range of layers in an LLM for the multi-hop QA task. We find that PEFT performs better than locate-and-edit techniques for time-sensitive knowledge edits.",
    "TIMEARENA: Shaping Efficient Multitasking Language Agents in a Time-Aware Simulation": "Despite remarkable advancements in emulating human-like behavior through Large Language Models (LLMs), current textual simulations do not adequately address the notion of time. To this end, we introduce TIMEARENA, a novel textual simulated environment that incorporates complex temporal dynamics and constraints that better reflect real-life planning scenarios. In TIMEARENA, agents are asked to complete multiple tasks as soon as possible, allowing for parallel processing to save time. We implement the dependency between actions, the time duration for each action, and the occupancy of the agent and the objects in the environment. TIMEARENA grounds to 30 real-world tasks in cooking, household activity, and laboratory work. We conduct extensive experiments with various LLMs using TIMEARENA. Our findings reveal that even the most powerful models, e.g., GPT-4, still lag behind humans in effective multitasking, underscoring the need for enhanced temporal awareness in the development of language agents.",
    "TIMEBENCH: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Temporal Reasoning Abilities in Large Language Models": "Grasping the concept of time is a fundamental facet of human cognition, indispensable for truly comprehending the intricacies of the world. Previous studies typically focus on specific aspects of time, lacking a comprehensive temporal reasoning benchmark. To address this, we propose TIMEBENCH, a comprehensive hierarchical temporal reasoning benchmark that covers a broad spectrum of temporal reasoning phenomena. TIMEBENCH provides a thorough evaluation for investigating the temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models. We conduct extensive experiments on GPT-4, LLaMA2, and other popular LLMs under various settings. Our experimental results indicate a significant performance gap between the state-of-the-art LLMs and humans, highlighting that there is still a considerable distance to cover in temporal reasoning. Besides, LLMs exhibit capability discrepancies across different reasoning categories. Furthermore, we thoroughly analyze the impact of multiple aspects on temporal reasoning and emphasize the associated challenges. We aspire for TIMEBENCH to serve as a comprehensive benchmark, fostering research in temporal reasoning.",
    "TIMECHARA: Evaluating Point-in-Time Character Hallucination of Role-Playing Large Language Models": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as agents to simulate human behaviors (i.e., role-playing agents), we emphasize the importance of point-in-time role-playing. This situates characters at specific moments in the narrative progression for three main reasons: (i) enhancing users' narrative immersion, (ii) avoiding spoilers, and (iii) fostering engagement in fandom role-playing. To accurately represent characters at specific time points, agents must avoid character hallucination, where they display knowledge that contradicts their characters' identities and historical timelines. We introduce TIMECHARA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate point-in-time character hallucination in role-playing LLMs. Comprising 10,895 instances generated through an automated pipeline, this benchmark reveals significant hallucination issues in current state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o). To counter this challenge, we propose NARRATIVE-EXPERTS, a method that decomposes the reasoning steps and utilizes narrative experts to reduce point-in-time character hallucinations effectively. Still, our findings with TIMECHARA highlight the ongoing challenges of point-in-time character hallucination, calling for further study.",
    "Timeline-based Sentence Decomposition with In-Context Learning for Temporal Fact Extraction": "Facts extraction is pivotal for constructing knowledge graphs. Recently, the increasing demand for temporal facts in downstream tasks has led to the emergence of the task of temporal fact extraction. In this paper, we specifically address the extraction of temporal facts from natural language text. Previous studies fail to handle the challenge of establishing time-to-fact correspondences in complex sentences. To overcome this hurdle, we propose a timeline-based sentence decomposition strategy using large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning, ensuring a fine-grained understanding of the timeline associated with various facts. In addition, we evaluate the performance of LLMs for direct temporal fact extraction and get unsatisfactory results. To this end, we introduce TSDRE1, a method that incorporates the decomposition capabilities of LLMs into the traditional fine-tuning of smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs). To support the evaluation, we construct ComplexTRED, a complex temporal fact extraction dataset. Our experiments show that TSDRE achieves state-of-the-art results on both HyperRED-Temporal and ComplexTRED datasets.",
    "TIMETOM: Temporal Space is the Key to Unlocking the Door of Large Language Models' Theory-of-Mind": "Theory of Mind (ToM)—the cognitive ability to reason about mental states of ourselves and others, is the foundation of social interaction. Although ToM comes naturally to humans, it poses a significant challenge to even the most advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to the complex logical chains in ToM reasoning, especially in higher-order ToM questions, simply utilizing reasoning methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) will not improve the ToM capabilities of LLMs. We present TIMETOM, which constructs a temporal space and uses it as the foundation to improve the ToM capabilities of LLMs in multiple scenarios. Specifically, within the temporal space, we construct Temporal Belief State Chain (TBSC) for each character and inspired by the cognition perspective of the social world model, we divide TBSC into self-world beliefs and social world beliefs, aligning with first-order ToM (first-order beliefs) and higher-order ToM (higher-order beliefs) questions, respectively. Moreover, we design a novel tool-belief solver that, by considering belief communication between characters in temporal space, can transform a character's higher-order beliefs into another character's first-order beliefs under belief communication period. Experimental results indicate that TIMETOM can dramatically improve the reasoning performance of LLMs on ToM questions while taking a big step towards coherent and robust ToM reasoning.",
    "TLab at #SMM4H 2024: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for ADE Extraction and Normalization": "SMM4H 2024 Task 1 is focused on the identification and standardization of Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) in tweets. We introduce a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method, leveraging the capabilities of Llama 3, GPT-4, and the SFR-embedding-mistral model, along with few-shot prompting techniques, to map colloquial tweet language to MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs) without relying on extensive training datasets. Our method achieved competitive performance, with an F1 score of 0.359 in the normalization task and 0.392 in the named entity recognition (NER) task. Notably, our model demonstrated robustness in identifying previously unseen MedDRA PTs (F1=0.363) greatly surpassing the median task score of 0.141 for such terms.",
    "TLCR: Token-Level Continuous Reward for Fine-grained Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages human preference data to train language models to align more closely with human essence. These human preference data, however, are labeled at the sequence level, creating a mismatch between sequence-level preference labels and tokens, which are autoregressively generated from the language model. Although several recent approaches have tried to provide token-level (i.e., dense) rewards for each individual token, these typically rely on predefined discrete reward values (e.g., positive: +1, negative: -1, neutral: 0), failing to account for varying degrees of preference inherent to each token. To address this limitation, we introduce TLCR (Token-Level Continuous Reward) for RLHF, which incorporates a discriminator trained to distinguish positive and negative tokens, and the confidence of the discriminator is used to assign continuous rewards to each token considering the context. Extensive experiments show that TLCR leads to consistent performance improvements over previous sequence-level or token-level discrete rewards on open-ended generation benchmarks.",
    "To Generate or to Retrieve? On the Effectiveness of Artificial Contexts for Medical Open-Domain Question Answering": "Medical open-domain question answering demands substantial access to specialized knowledge. Recent efforts have sought to decouple knowledge from model parameters, counteracting architectural scaling and allowing for training on common low-resource hardware. The retrieve-then-read paradigm has become ubiquitous, with model predictions grounded on relevant knowledge pieces from external repositories such as PubMed, textbooks, and UMLS. An alternative path, still under-explored but made possible by the advent of domain-specific large language models, entails constructing artificial contexts through prompting. As a result, to generate or to retrieve is the modern equivalent of Hamlet's dilemma. This paper presents MEDGENIE, the first generate-then-read framework for multiple-choice question answering in medicine. We conduct extensive experiments on MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and MMLU, incorporating a practical perspective by assuming a maximum of 24GB VRAM. MEDGENIE sets a new state-of-the-art in the open-book setting of each testbed, allowing a small-scale reader to outcompete zero-shot closed-book 175B baselines while using up to 706× fewer parameters. Our findings reveal that generated passages are more effective than retrieved ones in attaining higher accuracy.",
    "To What Extent Are Large Language Models Capable of Generating Substantial Reflections for Motivational Interviewing Counseling Chatbots?": "Motivational Interviewing is a counselling style that requires skillful usage of reflective listen- ing and engaging in conversations about sen- sitive and personal subjects. In this paper, we investigate to what extent we can use gener- ative large language models in motivational interviewing chatbots to generate precise and variable reflections on user responses. We con- duct a two-step human evaluation where we first independently assess the generated reflec- tions based on four criteria essential to health counseling; appropriateness, specificity, natu- ralness, and engagement. In the second step, we compare the overall quality of generated and human-authored reflections via a ranking evalu- ation. We use GPT-4, BLOOM, and FLAN-T5 models to generate motivational interviewing reflections, based on real conversational data collected via chatbots designed to provide sup- port for smoking cessation and sexual health. We discover that GPT-4 can produce reflections of a quality comparable to human-authored re- flections. Finally, we conclude that large lan- guage models have the potential to enhance and expand reflections in predetermined health counseling chatbots, but a comprehensive man- ual review is advised.",
    "Token-wise Influential Training Data Retrieval for Large Language Models": "Given a Large Language Model (LLM) generation, how can we identify which training data led to this generation? In this paper, we proposed RapidIn, a scalable framework adapting to LLMs for estimating the influence of each training data. The proposed framework consists of two stages: caching and retrieval. First, we compress the gradient vectors by over 200,000x, allowing them to be cached on disk or in GPU/CPU memory. Then, given a generation, RapidIn efficiently traverses the cached gradients to estimate the influence within minutes, achieving over a 6,326x speedup. Moreover, RapidIn supports multi-GPU parallelization to substantially accelerate caching and retrieval. Our empirical result confirms the efficiency and effectiveness of RapidIn.",
    "Too Big to Fail: Larger Language Models are Disproportionately Resilient to Induction of Dementia-Related Linguistic Anomalies": "As artificial neural networks grow in complexity, understanding their inner workings becomes increasingly challenging, which is particularly important in healthcare applications. The intrinsic evaluation metrics of autoregressive neural language models (NLMs), perplexity (PPL), can reflect how “surprised” an NLM model is at novel input. PPL has been widely used to understand the behavior of NLMs. Previous findings show that changes in PPL when masking attention layers in pre-trained transformer-based NLMs reflect linguistic anomalies associated with Alzheimer's disease dementia. Building upon this, we explore a novel bidirectional attention head ablation method that exhibits properties attributed to the concepts of cognitive and brain reserve in human brain studies, which postulate that people with more neurons in the brain and more efficient processing are more resilient to neurodegeneration. Our results show that larger GPT-2 models require a disproportionately larger share of attention heads to be masked/ablated to display degradation of similar magnitude to masking in smaller models. These results suggest that the attention mechanism in transformer models may present an analogue to the notions of cognitive and brain reserve and could potentially be used to model certain aspects of the progression of neurodegenerative disorders and aging.",
    "ToolSword: Unveiling Safety Issues of Large Language Models in Tool Learning Across Three Stages": "Tool learning is widely acknowledged as a foundational approach for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios. While current research primarily emphasizes leveraging tools to augment LLMs, it frequently neglects emerging safety considerations tied to their application. To fill this gap, we present ToolSword, a comprehensive framework dedicated to meticulously investigating safety issues linked to LLMs in tool learning. Specifically, ToolSword delineates six safety scenarios for LLMs in tool learning, encompassing malicious queries and jailbreak attacks in the input stage, noisy misdirection and risky cues in the execution stage, and harmful feedback and error conflicts in the output stage. Experiments conducted on 11 open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal enduring safety challenges in tool learning, such as handling harmful queries, employing risky tools, and delivering detrimental feedback, which even GPT-4 is susceptible to. Moreover, we conduct further studies with the aim of fostering research on tool learning safety. The data is released in https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/ToolSword.",
    "Topic Modeling for Short Texts with Large Language Models": "As conventional topic models rely on word co-occurrence to infer latent topics, topic modeling for short texts has been a long-standing challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) can potentially overcome this challenge by contextually learning the meanings of words via pretraining. In this paper, we study two approaches to using LLMs for topic modeling: parallel prompting and sequential prompting. Input length limitations prevent LLMs from processing many texts at once. However, an arbitrary number of texts can be handled by LLMs by splitting the texts into smaller subsets and processing them in parallel or sequentially. Our experimental results demonstrate that our methods can identify more coherent topics than existing ones while maintaining the diversity of the induced topics. Furthermore, we found that the inferred topics cover the input texts to some extent, while hallucinated topics are hardly generated.",
    "TOREE: Evaluating Topic Relevance of Student Essays for Chinese Primary and Middle School Education": "Topic relevance of an essay demands that the composition adheres to a clear theme and aligns well with the essay prompt requirements, a critical aspect of essay quality evaluation. However, existing research of Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) for Chinese essays has overlooked topic relevance and lacks detailed feedback, while Automatic Essay Comment Generation (AECG) faces much complexity and difficulty. Additionally, current Large Language Models, including GPT-4, often make incorrect judgments and provide overly impractical feedback when evaluating topic relevance. This paper introduces TOREE (Topic Relevance Evaluation), a comprehensive dataset developed to assess topic relevance in Chinese primary and middle school students' essays, which is beneficial for AES, AECG and other applications. Moreover, our proposed two-step method utilizes TOREE through a combination of Supervised Fine-tuning and Preference Learning. Experimental results demonstrate that TOREE is of high quality, and our method significantly enhances models' performance on two designed tasks for topic relevance evaluation, improving both automatic and human evaluations across four diverse LLMs.",
    "Toward In-Context Teaching: Adapting Examples to Students' Misconceptions": "When a teacher provides examples for a student to study, these examples must be informative, enabling a student to progress from their current state toward a target concept or skill. Good teachers must therefore simultaneously infer what students already know and adapt their teaching to students' changing state of knowledge. There is increasing interest in using computational models, particularly large language models, as pedagogical tools. As students, language models in particular have shown a remarkable ability to adapt to new tasks given small numbers of examples. But how effectively can these models adapt as teachers to students of different types? To study this question, we introduce a suite of models and evaluation methods we call ADAPT. ADAPT has two components: (1) a collection of simulated Bayesian student models that can be used for evaluation of automated teaching methods; (2) a platform for evaluation with human students, to characterize the real-world effectiveness of these methods. We additionally introduce (3) ATOM, a new probabilistic method for adaptive teaching that jointly infers students' past beliefs and optimizes for the correctness of future beliefs. In evaluations of simulated students across three learning domains (fraction arithmetic, English morphology, function learning), ATOM systematically outperforms LLM-based and standard Bayesian teaching methods. In human experiments, both ATOM and LLMs outperform non-adaptive random example selection. Our results highlight both the difficulty of the adaptive teaching task and the potential of learned adaptive methods for solving it.",
    "Toward Reliable Ad-hoc Scientific Information Extraction: A Case Study on Two Materials Datasets": "We explore the ability of GPT-4 to perform ad-hoc schema based information extraction from scientific literature. We assess specifically whether it can, with a basic prompting approach, replicate two existing material science datasets, given the manuscripts from which they were originally manually extracted. We employ materials scientists to perform a detailed manual error analysis to assess where the model struggles to faithfully extract the desired information, and draw on their insights to suggest research directions to address this broadly important task.",
    "Toward Structured Related Work Generation with Novelty Statements": "To help readers understand the novelty and the research context, an excellent related work section is structured (i.e., the section consists of multiple paragraphs organized by several research topics) and includes descriptions of novelty. However, previous studies viewed related work generation as just multi-document summarization, and the structure and novelty statements are ignored. In this paper, we redefine the related work generation task as structured related work generation with novelty statement (STRoGeNS), and we propose datasets and automatic evaluation metrics for structure and novelty for STRoGeNS. On our structured related work generation with novelty statement, we investigate the state-of-the-art language models and deliver insights about the effects of pre-training and input context. In addition, we confirm the validity of the proposed automatic evaluation metrics with human evaluation. Source code is publicly available at https://github.com/omron-sinicx/STRoGeNS.",
    "Towards A Unified View of Answer Calibration for Multi-Step Reasoning": "Large Language Models (LLMs) employing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have broadened the scope for improving multi-step reasoning capabilities. We generally divide multi-step reasoning into two phases: path generation to generate the reasoning path(s); and answer calibration post-processing the reasoning path(s) to obtain a final answer. However, the existing literature lacks systematic analysis on different answer calibration approaches. In this paper, we summarize the taxonomy of recent answer calibration techniques and break them down into step-level and path-level strategies. We then conduct a thorough evaluation on these strategies from a unified view, systematically scrutinizing step-level and path-level answer calibration across multiple paths. Experimental results reveal that integrating the dominance of both strategies tends to derive optimal outcomes. Our study holds the potential to illuminate key insights for optimizing multi-step reasoning with answer calibration.",
    "Towards Artwork Explanation in Large-scale Vision Language Models": "Large-scale Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) output text from images and instructions, demonstrating advanced capabilities in text generation and comprehension. However, it has not been clarified to what extent LVLMs understand the knowledge necessary for explaining images, the complex relationships between various pieces of knowledge, and how they integrate these understandings into their explanations. To address this issue, we propose a new task: the artwork explanation generation task, along with its evaluation dataset and metric for quantitatively assessing the understanding and utilization of knowledge about artworks. This task is apt for image description based on the premise that LVLMs are expected to have pre-existing knowledge of artworks, which are often subjects of wide recognition and documented information. It consists of two parts: generating explanations from both images and titles of artworks, and generating explanations using only images, thus evaluating the LVLMs' language-based and vision-based knowledge. Alongside, we release a training dataset for LVLMs to learn explanations that incorporate knowledge about artworks. Our findings indicate that LVLMs not only struggle with integrating language and visual information but also exhibit a more pronounced limitation in acquiring knowledge from images alone.",
    "Towards Demonstration-Aware Large Language Models for Machine Translation": "Tuning-based large language models for machine translation (aka large translation model, LTM) have demonstrated significant performance in the field of machine translation. Despite their success, these models often face difficulties in leveraging demonstrations to further improve their performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel approach that integrates demonstration-aware training and inference strategies within the framework of tuning-based LTMs, hereby referred to as demonstration-aware LTMs. During training, we enrich the model's learning process by incorporating both sentence- and document-level demonstrations derived from its original training dataset. During inference, the model synergizes its own contextual translations with retrieved high-quality demonstrations, leading to more precise and contextually appropriate outputs. Empirical results reveal that our demonstration-aware LTM not only mitigates the negative impacts traditionally associated with demonstrations but also secures substantial improvements in translation accuracy, particularly in domain-specific and document-level translation tasks. Source code and scripts are freely available at https://github.com/ChenLi0620/Demo-Aware-LLM-MT.",
    "Towards Faithful and Robust LLM Specialists for Evidence-Based Question-Answering": "Advances towards more faithful and traceable answers of Large Language Models (LLMs) are crucial for various research and practical endeavors. One avenue in reaching this goal is basing the answers on reliable sources. However, this Evidence-Based QA has proven to work insufficiently with LLMs in terms of citing the correct sources (source quality) and truthfully representing the information within sources (answer attributability). In this work, we systematically investigate how to robustly fine-tune LLMs for better source quality and answer attributability. Specifically, we introduce a data generation pipeline with automated data quality filters, which can synthesize diversified high-quality training and testing data at scale. We further introduce four test sets to benchmark the robustness of fine-tuned specialist models. Extensive evaluation shows that fine-tuning on synthetic data improves performance on both in- and out-of-distribution. Furthermore, we show that data quality, which can be drastically improved by proposed quality filters, matters more than quantity in improving Evidence-Based QA.",
    "Towards Multiple References Era - Addressing Data Leakage and Limited Reference Diversity in Machine Translation Evaluation": "Recent research has shown a weak correlation between n-gram-based metrics and human evaluations in machine translation task, particularly when evaluating large language models (LLMs). Additionally, the data leakage risk in LLMs may cause an overestimation problem when evaluating LLMs on downstream tasks. In this work, we identify the limited diversity of references as the primary cause for the inferior performance of n-gram-based metrics and the overestimation problem. To address this issue, we propose to utilize multiple references generated by LLMs, coupled with an effective selection strategy focused on accuracy and diversity, to improve the alignment between automatic metrics and human evaluations. We validate our approach on the WMT22 Metrics benchmark with 4 languages and observe a maximum accuracy gain of 9.5% in F200spBLEU, which makes it on par with computationally expensive neural-based metrics. We also show that using multi-reference with n-gram-based metrics significantly alleviates the overestimation problem when evaluating LLMs with data leakage. Further analysis explores the factors that affect the quality of generated references, offering insights into data synthesis by LLMs. We released the code and generated reference1 to encourage research on reference quality.",
    "Towards Objectively Benchmarking Social Intelligence of Language Agents at the Action Level": "Prominent large language models have exhibited human-level performance in many domains, even enabling the derived agents to simulate human and social interactions. While practical works have substantiated the practicality of grounding language agents in sandbox simulation or embodied simulators, current social intelligence benchmarks either stay at the language level or use subjective metrics.  In pursuit of a more realistic and objective evaluation, we introduce the Social Tasks in Sandbox Simulation (STSS) benchmark, which assesses language agents objectively at the action level by scrutinizing the goal achievements within the multi-agent simulation. Additionally, we sample conversation scenarios to build a language-level benchmark to provide an economically prudent preliminary evaluation and align with prevailing benchmarks. To gauge the significance of agent architecture, we implement a target-driven planning (TDP) module as an adjunct to the existing agent.  Our evaluative findings highlight that the STSS benchmark is challenging for state-of-the-art language agents. Furthermore, it effectively discriminates between distinct language agents, suggesting its usefulness as a benchmark for evaluating both language models and agent architectures.",
    "Towards Robust Temporal Reasoning of Large Language Models via a Multi-Hop QA Dataset and Pseudo-Instruction Tuning": "Knowledge in the real world is being updated constantly. However, it is costly to frequently update large language models (LLMs). Therefore, it is crucial for LLMs to understand the concept of temporal knowledge. Prior works on temporal question answering (TQA) did not emphasize multi-answer and multi-hop types of temporal reasoning. In this paper, we propose a complex temporal question-answering dataset Complex-TR that focuses on multi-answer and multi-hop temporal reasoning. Besides, we also propose a novel data augmentation strategy to improve the complex temporal reasoning capability and robustness of LLMs. We conducted experiments on multiple temporal QA datasets. Experimental results show that our method is able to improve LLMs' performance on temporal QA benchmarks by significant margins.",
    "Towards Safer Large Language Models through Machine Unlearning": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated their vast potential across various domains, attributed to their extensive pretraining knowledge and exceptional generalizability. However, LLMs often encounter challenges in generating harmful content when faced with problematic prompts. To address this problem, existing work attempted to implement a gradient ascent-based approach to prevent LLMs from producing harmful output. While these methods can be effective, they frequently impact the model utility in responding to normal prompts. To address this gap, we introduce Selective Knowledge negation Unlearning (SKU), a novel unlearning framework for LLMs, designed to eliminate harmful knowledge while preserving utility on normal prompts. Specifically, SKU is consisted of two stages: harmful knowledge acquisition stage and knowledge negation stage. The first stage aims to identify and acquire harmful knowledge within the model, whereas the second is dedicated to remove this knowledge. SKU selectively isolates and removes harmful knowledge in model parameters, ensuring the model's performance remains robust on normal prompts. Our experiments conducted across various LLM architectures demonstrate that SKU identifies a good balance point between removing harmful information and preserving utility.",
    "Towards Tracing Trustworthiness Dynamics: Revisiting Pre-training Period of Large Language Models": "Ensuring the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) is crucial. Most studies concentrate on fully pre-trained LLMs to better understand and improve LLMs' trustworthiness. In this paper, to reveal the untapped potential of pre-training, we pioneer the exploration of LLMs' trustworthiness during this period, focusing on five key dimensions: reliability, privacy, toxicity, fairness, and robustness. To begin with, we apply linear probing to LLMs. The high probing accuracy suggests that LLMs in early pre-training can already distinguish concepts in each trustworthiness dimension. Therefore, to further uncover the hidden possibilities of pre-training, we extract steering vectors from a LLM's pre-training checkpoints to enhance the LLM's trustworthiness. Finally, inspired by Choi et al. (2023) that mutual information estimation is bounded by linear probing accuracy, we also probe LLMs with mutual information to investigate the dynamics of trustworthiness during pre-training. We are the first to observe a similar two-phase phenomenon: fitting and compression (Shwartz-Ziv and Tishby, 2017). This research provides an initial exploration of trustworthiness modeling during LLM pre-training, seeking to unveil new insights and spur further developments in the field. Our code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/ChnQ/TracingLLM.",
    "Towards Uncertainty-Aware Language Agent": "While Language Agents have achieved promising success by placing Large Language Models at the core of a more versatile design that dynamically interacts with the external world, the existing approaches neglect the notion of uncertainty during these interactions. We present the Uncertainty-Aware Language Agent (UALA), a framework that orchestrates the interaction between the agent and the external world using uncertainty quantification. Compared with other well-known counterparts like ReAct, our extensive experiments across 3 representative tasks (HotpotQA, StrategyQA, MMLU) and various LLM sizes demonstrate that UALA brings a significant improvement of performance, while having a substantially lower reliance on the external world (i.e., reduced number of tool calls and tokens). Our analyses provide various insights including the great potential of UALA compared with agent fine-tuning, and underscore the unreliability of verbalised confidence of LLMs as a proxy for uncertainty.",
    "Towards Unified Task Embeddings Across Multiple Models: Bridging the Gap for Prompt-Based Large Language Models and Beyond": "Task embedding, a meta-learning technique that captures task-specific information, has gained popularity, especially in areas such as multi-task learning, model editing, and interpretability. However, it faces challenges with the emergence of prompt-guided Large Language Models (LLMs) operating in a gradient-free manner. Existing task embedding methods rely on fine-tuned, task-specific language models, which hinders the adaptability of task embeddings across diverse models, especially prompt-based LLMs. To harness the potential of task embeddings in the era of LLMs, we propose a framework for unified task embeddings (FUTE), harmonizing task embeddings from various models, including smaller language models and LLMs with varied prompts, within a single vector space. Such uniformity enables comparison and analysis of similarities amongst different models, broadening the scope and utility of existing task embedding methods in multi-model scenarios, while maintaining their performance comparable to architecture-specific methods.",
    "Towards Verifiable Generation: A Benchmark for Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution": "Although achieving great success, Large Language Models (LLMs) usually suffer from unreliable hallucinations. Although language attribution can be a potential solution, there are no suitable benchmarks and evaluation metrics to attribute LLMs to structured knowledge. In this paper, we define a new task of Knowledge-aware Language Model Attribution (KaLMA) that improves upon three core concerns with conventional attributed LMs. First, we extend attribution source from unstructured texts to Knowledge Graph (KG), whose rich structures benefit both the attribution performance and working scenarios. Second, we propose a new “Conscious Incompetence setting considering the incomplete knowledge repository, where the model identifies the need for supporting knowledge beyond the provided KG. Third, we propose a comprehensive automatic evaluation metric encompassing text quality, citation quality, and text citation alignment. To implement the above innovations, we build a dataset in the biography domain BioKaLMA via evolutionary question generation strategy, to control the question complexity and necessary knowledge to the answer. For evaluation, we develop a baseline solution and demonstrate the room for improvement in LLMs' citation generation, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the Conscious Incompetence setting, and the critical role of retrieval accuracy.",
    "Tox-BART: Leveraging Toxicity Attributes for Explanation Generation of Implicit Hate Speech": "Employing language models to generate explanations for an incoming implicit hate post is an active area of research. The explanation is intended to make explicit the underlying stereotype and aid content moderators. The training often combines top-k relevant knowledge graph (KG) tuples to provide world knowledge and improve performance on standard metrics. Interestingly, our study presents conflicting evidence for the role of the quality of KG tuples in generating implicit explanations. Consequently, simpler models incorporating external toxicity signals outperform KG-infused models. Compared to the KG-based setup, we observe a comparable performance for SBIC (LatentHatred) datasets with a performance variation of +0.44 (+0.49), +1.83 (-1.56), and -4.59 (+0.77) in BLEU, ROUGE-L, and BERTScore. Further human evaluation and error analysis reveal that our proposed setup produces more precise explanations than zero-shot GPT-3.5, highlighting the intricate nature of the task.",
    "Trace-of-Thought Prompting: Investigating Prompt-Based Knowledge Distillation Through Question Decomposition": "Knowledge distillation allows smaller neural networks to emulate the performance of larger, teacher models with reduced computational demands. Traditional methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) often necessitate extensive fine-tuning, which limits their accessibility. To address this, we introduce Trace-of-Thought Prompting, a novel framework designed to distill critical reasoning capabilities from large-scale teacher models (over 8 billion parameters) to small-scale student models (up to 8 billion parameters). This approach leverages problem decomposition to enhance interpretability and facilitate human-in-the-loop interventions. Empirical evaluations on the GSM8K and MATH datasets show that student models achieve accuracy gains of up to 113% on GSM8K and 20% on MATH, with significant improvements particularly notable in smaller models like Llama 2 and Zephyr. Our results suggest a promising pathway for open-source, small-scale models to eventually serve as both students and teachers, potentially reducing our reliance on large-scale, proprietary models. Our code, featuring data analytics and testing scripts, is provided here.",
    "Training Language Models to Generate Text with Citations via Fine-grained Rewards": "While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven useful in answering user queries, they are prone to hallucination, and their responses often lack credibility due to missing references to reliable sources. An intuitive solution to these issues would be to include in-text citations referring to external documents as evidence. While previous works have directly prompted LLMs to generate in-text citations, their performances are far from satisfactory, especially when it comes to smaller LLMs. In this work, we propose an effective training framework using fine-grained rewards to teach LLMs to generate highly supportive and relevant citations, while ensuring the correctness of their responses. We also conduct a systematic analysis of applying these fine-grained rewards to common LLM training strategies, demonstrating its advantage over conventional practices. We conduct extensive experiments on Question Answering (QA) datasets taken from the ALCE benchmark and validate the model's generalizability using EXPERTQA. On LLaMA-2-7B, the incorporation of fine-grained rewards achieves the best performance among the baselines, even surpassing that of GPT-3.5-turbo.",
    "TRAM: Benchmarking Temporal Reasoning for Large Language Models": "Reasoning about time is essential for understanding the nuances of events described in natural language. Previous research on this topic has been limited in scope, characterized by a lack of standardized benchmarks that would allow for consistent evaluations across different studies. In this paper, we introduce TRAM, a temporal reasoning benchmark composed of ten datasets, encompassing various temporal aspects of events such as order, arithmetic, frequency, and duration, designed to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of the TeR capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate popular LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama2 in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, and establish baselines with BERT-based and domain-specific models. Our findings indicate that the best-performing model lags significantly behind human performance. It is our aspiration that TRAM will spur further progress in enhancing the TeR capabilities of LLMs. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/EternityYW/TRAM-Benchmark.",
    "Transferable and Efficient Non-Factual Content Detection via Probe Training with Offline Consistency Checking": "Detecting non-factual content is a long-standing goal to increase the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) generations. Current factuality probes, trained using human-annotated labels, exhibit limited transferability to out-of-distribution content, while online self-consistency checking imposes extensive computation burden due to the necessity of generating multiple outputs. This paper proposes PINOSE, which trains a probing model on offline self-consistency checking results, thereby circumventing the need for human-annotated data and achieving transferability across diverse data distributions. As the consistency check process is offline, PINOSE reduces the computational burden of generating multiple responses by online consistency verification. Additionally, it examines various aspects of internal states prior to response decoding, contributing to more effective detection of factual inaccuracies. Experiment results on both factuality detection and question answering benchmarks show that PINOSE achieves surpassing results than existing factuality detection methods. Our code and datasets are publicly available on this github repository.",
    "Transforming LLMs into Cross-modal and Cross-lingual Retrieval Systems": "Large language models (LLMs) are trained on text-only data that go far beyond the languages with paired speech and text data. At the same time, Dual Encoder (DE) based retrieval systems project queries and documents into the same embedding space and have demonstrated their success in retrieval and bi-text mining. To match speech and text in many languages, we propose using LLMs to initialize multi-modal DE retrieval systems. Unlike traditional methods, our system doesn't require speech data during LLM pre-training and can exploit LLM's multilingual text understanding capabilities to match speech and text in languages unseen during retrieval training. Our multi-modal LLM-based retrieval system is capable of matching speech and text in 102 languages despite only training on 21 languages. Our system outperforms previous systems trained explicitly on all 102 languages. We achieve a 10% absolute improvement in Recall@1 averaged across these languages. Additionally, our model demonstrates cross-lingual speech and text matching, which is further enhanced by readily available machine translation data.",
    "Transition-based Opinion Generation for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis": "Recently, the use of pre-trained generation models for extracting sentiment elements has resulted in significant advancements in aspect-based sentiment analysis benchmarks. However, these approaches often overlook the importance of explicitly modeling structure among sentiment elements. To address this limitation, we present a study that aims to integrate general pre-trained sequence-to-sequence language models with a structure-aware transition-based approach. Therefore, we propose a transition system for opinion tree generation, designed to better exploit pre-trained language models for structured fine-tuning. Our proposed transition system ensures the structural integrity of the generated opinion tree. By leveraging pre-trained generation models and simplifying the transition set, we are able to maximize the accuracy of opinion tree generation. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly advances the state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. In addition, the empirical studies also indicate that the proposed opinion tree generation with transition system is more effective in capturing the sentiment structure than other generation models.",
    "Transitive Consistency Constrained Learning for Entity-to-Entity Stance Detection": "Entity-to-entity stance detection identifies the stance between a pair of entities with a directed link that indicates the source, target, and polarity. It is a streamlined task without the complex dependency structure for structural sentiment analysis, while it is more informative compared to most previous work assuming that the source is the author. Previous work performs entity-to-entity stance detection training on individual entity pairs. However, stances between inter-connected entity pairs may be correlated. In this paper, we propose transitive consistency constrained learning, which first finds connected entity pairs and their stances, and adds an additional objective to enforce the transitive consistency. We explore consistency training on both classification-based and generation-based models and conduct experiments to compare consistency training with previous work and large language models with in-context learning. Experimental results illustrate that the inter-correlation of stances in political news can be used to improve the entity-to-entity stance detection model, while overly strict consistency enforcement may have a negative impact. In addition, we find that large language models struggle with predicting link direction and neutral labels in this task.",
    "TRANSLICO: A Contrastive Learning Framework to Address the Script Barrier in Multilingual Pretrained Language Models": "The world's more than 7000 languages are written in at least 293 scripts. Due to various reasons, many closely related languages use different scripts, which poses a difficulty for multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs) in learning crosslingual knowledge through lexical overlap. As a consequence, mPLMs are faced with a script barrier: representations from different scripts are located in different subspaces, which can result in crosslingual transfer involving languages of different scripts performing suboptimally. To address this problem, we propose TRANSLICO, a framework that optimizes the Transliteration Contrastive Modeling (TCM) objective to fine-tune an mPLM by contrasting sentences in its training data and their transliterations in a unified script (in our case Latin), which enhances uniformity in the representation space for different scripts. Using Glot500-m (ImaniGooghari et al., 2023), an mPLM pretrained on over 500 languages, as our source model, we fine-tune it on a small portion (5%) of its training data, and refer to the resulting model as FURINA. We show that FURINA not only better aligns representations from distinct scripts but also outperforms the original Glot500-m on various zero-shot crosslingual transfer tasks. Additionally, we achieve consistent improvement in a case study on the Indic group where the languages exhibit areal features but use different scripts. We make our code and models publicly available.",
    "Transparent and Scrutable Recommendations Using Natural Language User Profiles": "Recent state-of-the-art recommender systems predominantly rely on either implicit or explicit feedback from users to suggest new items. While effective in recommending novel options, many recommender systems often use uninterpretable embeddings to represent user preferences. This lack of transparency not only limits user understanding of why certain items are suggested but also reduces the user's ability to scrutinize and modify their preferences, thereby affecting their ability to receive a list of preferred recommendations. Given the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we investigate how a properly crafted prompt can be used to summarize a user's preferences from past reviews and recommend items based only on language-based preferences. In particular, we study how LLMs can be prompted to generate a natural language (NL) user profile that holistically describe a user's preferences. These NL profiles can then be leveraged to fine-tune a LLM using only NL profiles to make transparent and scrutable recommendations. Furthermore, we validate the scrutability of our user profile-based recommender by investigating the impact on recommendation changes after editing NL user profiles. According to our evaluations of the model's rating prediction performance on two benchmarking rating prediction datasets, we observe that this novel approach maintains a performance level on par with established recommender systems in a warm-start setting. With a systematic analysis into the effect of updating user profiles and system prompts, we show the advantage of our approach in easier adjustment of user preferences and a greater autonomy over users' received recommendations.",
    "TRAP: Targeted Random Adversarial Prompt Honeypot for Black-Box Identification": "Large Language Model (LLM) services and models often come with legal rules on who can use them and how they must use them. Assessing the compliance of the released LLMs is crucial, as these rules protect the interests of the LLM contributor and prevent misuse. In this context, we describe the novel fingerprinting problem of Black-box Identity Verification (BBIV). The goal is to determine whether a third-party application uses a certain LLM through its chat function. We propose a method called Targeted Random Adversarial Prompt (TRAP) that identifies the specific LLM in use. We repurpose adversarial suffixes, originally proposed for jailbreaking, to get a pre-defined answer from the target LLM, while other models give random answers. TRAP detects the target LLMs with over 95% true positive rate at under 0.2% false positive rate even after a single interaction. TRAP remains effective even if the LLM has minor changes that do not significantly alter the original function.",
    "Tree-of-Counterfactual Prompting for Zero-Shot Stance Detection": "Stance detection enables the inference of attitudes from human communications. Automatic stance identification was mostly cast as a classification problem. However, stance decisions involve complex judgments, which can be nowadays generated by prompting Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper we present a new method for stance identification which (1) relies on a new prompting framework, called Tree-of-Counterfactual prompting; (2) operates not only on textual communications, but also on images; (3) allows more than one stance object type; and (4) requires no examples of stance attribution, thus it is a Tabula Rasa Zero-Shot Stance Detection (TR-ZSSD) method. Our experiments indicate surprisingly promising results, outperforming fine-tuned stance detection systems.",
    "Tree-of-Traversals: A Zero-Shot Reasoning Algorithm for Augmenting Black-box Language Models with Knowledge Graphs": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) complement Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing reliable, structured, domain-specific, and up-to-date external knowledge. However, KGs and LLMs are often developed separately and must be integrated after training. We introduce Tree-of-Traversals, a novel zero-shot reasoning algorithm that enables augmentation of black-box LLMs with one or more KGs. The algorithm equips a LLM with actions for interfacing a KG and enables the LLM to perform tree search over possible thoughts and actions to find high confidence reasoning paths. We evaluate on two popular benchmark datasets. Our results show that Tree-of-Traversals significantly improves performance on question answering and KG question answering tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/amazon-science/tree-of-traversals.",
    "Tree-Planted Transformers: Unidirectional Transformer Language Models with Implicit Syntactic Supervision": "Syntactic Language Models (SLMs) can be trained efficiently to reach relatively high performance; however, they have trouble with inference efficiency due to the explicit generation of syntactic structures. In this paper, we propose a new method dubbed tree-planting: instead of explicitly generating syntactic structures, we “plant” trees into attention weights of unidirectional Transformer LMs to implicitly reflect syntactic structures of natural language. Specifically, unidirectional Transformer LMs trained with tree-planting will be called Tree-Planted Transformers (TPT), which inherit the training efficiency from SLMs without changing the inference efficiency of their underlying Transformer LMs. Targeted syntactic evaluations on the SyntaxGym benchmark demonstrated that TPTs, despite the lack of explicit generation of syntactic structures, significantly outperformed not only vanilla Transformer LMs but also various SLMs that generate hundreds of syntactic structures in parallel. This result suggests that TPTs can learn human-like syntactic knowledge as data-efficiently as SLMs while maintaining the modeling space of Transformer LMs unchanged.",
    "Trial and Error: Exploration-Based Trajectory Optimization for LLM Agents": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral components in various autonomous agent systems. In this study, we present an exploration-based trajectory optimization approach, referred to as ETO. This learning method is designed to enhance the performance of open LLM agents. Contrary to previous studies that exclusively train on successful expert trajectories, our method allows agents to learn from their exploration failures. This leads to improved performance through an iterative optimization framework. During the exploration phase, the agent interacts with the environment while completing given tasks, gathering failure trajectories to create contrastive trajectory pairs. In the subsequent training phase, the agent utilizes these trajectory preference pairs to update its policy using contrastive learning methods like DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023). This iterative cycle of exploration and training fosters continued improvement in the agents. Our experiments on three complex tasks demonstrate that ETO consistently surpasses baseline performance by a large margin. Furthermore, an examination of task-solving efficiency and potential in scenarios lacking expert trajectory underscores the effectiveness of our approach.",
    "Truth-Aware Context Selection: Mitigating Hallucinations of Large Language Models Being Misled by Untruthful Contexts": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive text generation capabilities, they are easily misled by untruthful contexts provided by users or knowledge augmentation tools, leading to hallucinations. To alleviate LLMs from being misled by untruthful context and take advantage of knowledge augmentation, we propose Truth-Aware Context Selection (TACS), a lightweight method to adaptively recognize and mask untruthful context from the inputs. TACS begins by performing truth detection on the input context, leveraging the parameterized knowledge within the LLM. Subsequently, it constructs a corresponding attention mask based on the truthfulness of each position, selecting the truthful context and discarding the untruthful context. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation metric, Disturbance Adaption Rate, to further study the LLMs' ability to accept truthful information and resist untruthful information. Experimental results indicate that TACS can effectively filter untruthful context and significantly improve the overall quality of LLMs' responses when presented with misleading information.",
    "TruthX: Alleviating Hallucinations by Editing Large Language Models in Truthful Space": "Large Language Models (LLMs) sometimes suffer from producing hallucinations, especially LLMs may generate untruthful responses despite knowing the correct knowledge. Activating the truthfulness within LLM is the key to fully unlocking LLM's knowledge potential. In this paper, we propose TruthX, an inference-time intervention method to activate the truthfulness of LLM by identifying and editing the features within LLM's internal representations that govern the truthfulness. TruthX employs an auto-encoder to map LLM's representations into semantic and truthful latent spaces respectively, and applies contrastive learning to identify a truthful editing direction within the truthful space. During inference, by editing LLM's internal representations in truthful space, TruthX effectively enhances the truthfulness of LLM. Experiments show that TruthX improves the truthfulness of 13 advanced LLMs by an average of 20% on TruthfulQA benchmark. Further analyses suggest that TruthX can control LLM to produce truthful or hallucinatory responses via editing only one vector in LLM's internal representations.",
    "Tuning Large Multimodal Models for Videos using Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback": "Recent advancements in large language models have influenced the development of video large multimodal models (VLMMs). Previous approaches for VLMMs involve Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with instruction-tuned datasets, integrating LLM with visual encoders, and additional learnable parameters. Here, aligning video with text, and vice versa, remains a challenge, primarily due to the insufficient quality and quantity of multimodal instruction-tune data compared to that of text-only. This discrepancy often results in alignments that poorly ground the video content. To address this, we present a novel alignment strategy that employs a multimodal AI system equipped with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), providing self-preference feedback to refine itself and facilitating the alignment of video and text modalities. Our approach uniquely integrates detailed video descriptions as context into a multimodal AI system during preference feedback generation to enrich the understanding of video content, a process we call context-aware reward modeling. Empirical evaluations on various video benchmarks demonstrate that our VLM-RLAIF outperforms existing approaches, including the SFT model. We commit to open-sourcing our code, models, and datasets to foster further research in this area.",
    "Tuning LLMs with Contrastive Alignment Instructions for Machine Translation in Unseen, Low-resource Languages": "This article introduces contrastive alignment instructions (AlignInstruct) to address two challenges in machine translation (MT) on large language models (LLMs). One is the expansion of supported languages to previously unseen ones. The second relates to the lack of data in low-resource languages. Model fine-tuning through MT instructions (MTInstruct) is a straightforward approach to the first challenge. However, MTInstruct is limited by weak cross-lingual signals inherent in the second challenge. AlignInstruct emphasizes cross-lingual supervision via a cross-lingual discriminator built using statistical word alignments. Our results based on fine-tuning the BLOOMZ models (1b1, 3b, and 7b1) in up to 24 unseen languages showed that: (1) LLMs can effectively translate unseen languages using MTInstruct; (2) AlignInstruct led to consistent improvements in translation quality across 48 translation directions involving English; (3) Discriminator-based instructions outperformed their generative counterparts as cross-lingual instructions; (4) AlignInstruct improved performance in 30 zero-shot directions.",
    "Turiya at DialAM-2024: Inference Anchoring Theory Based LLM Parsers": "Representing discourse as argument graphs facilitates robust analysis. Although computational frameworks for constructing graphs from monologues exist, there is a lack of frameworks for parsing dialogue. Inference Anchoring Theory (IAT) is a theoretical framework for extracting graphical argument structures and relationships from dialogues. Here, we introduce computational models for implementing the IAT framework for parsing dialogues. We experiment with a classification-based biaffine parser and Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative methods and compare them. Our results demonstrate the utility of finetuning LLMs for constructing IAT-based argument graphs from dialogues, which is a nuanced task.",
    "Turn-Level Empathy Prediction Using Psychological Indicators": "For the WASSA 2024 Empathy and Personality Prediction Shared Task, we propose a novel turn-level empathy detection method that decomposes empathy into six psychological indicators: Emotional Language, Perspective-Taking, Sympathy and Compassion, Extroversion, Openness, and Agreeableness. A pipeline of text enrichment using a Large Language Model (LLM) followed by DeBERTA fine-tuning demonstrates a significant improvement in the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and F1 scores for empathy detection, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our system officially ranked 7th at the CONV-turn track.",
    "Two-Pronged Human Evaluation of ChatGPT Self-Correction in Radiology Report Simplification": "Radiology reports are highly technical documents aimed primarily at doctor-doctor communication. There has been an increasing interest in sharing those reports with patients, necessitating providing them patient-friendly simplifications of the original reports. This study explores the suitability of large language models in automatically generating those simplifications. We examine the usefulness of chain-of-thought and self-correction prompting mechanisms in this domain. We also propose a new evaluation protocol that employs radiologists and laypeople, where radiologists verify the factual correctness of simplifications, and laypeople assess simplicity and comprehension. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of self-correction prompting in producing high-quality simplifications. Our findings illuminate the preferences of radiologists and laypeople regarding text simplification, informing future research on this topic.",
    "Two-stage Generative Question Answering on Temporal Knowledge Graph Using Large Language Models": "Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) poses a significant challenge task, due to the temporal constraints hidden in questions and the answers sought from dynamic structured knowledge. Although large language models (LLMs) have made considerable progress in their reasoning ability over structured data, their application to the TKGQA task is a relatively unexplored area. This paper first proposes a novel generative temporal knowledge graph question answering framework, GenTKGQA, which guides LLMs to answer temporal questions through two phases: Subgraph Retrieval and Answer Generation. First, we exploit LLM's intrinsic knowledge to mine temporal constraints and structural links in the questions without extra training, thus narrowing down the subgraph search space in both temporal and structural dimensions. Next, we design virtual knowledge indicators to fuse the graph neural network signals of the subgraph and the text representations of the LLM in a non-shallow way, which helps the open-source LLM deeply understand the temporal order and structural dependencies among the retrieved facts through instruction tuning. Experimental results on two widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model.",
    "UF-HOBI at “Discharge Me!”: A Hybrid Solution for Discharge Summary Generation Through Prompt-based Tuning of GatorTronGPT Models": "Automatic generation of discharge summaries presents significant challenges due to the length of clinical documentation, the dispersed nature of patient information, and the diverse terminology used in healthcare. This paper presents a hybrid solution for generating discharge summary sections as part of our participation in the “Discharge Me!” Challenge at the BioNLP 2024 Shared Task. We developed a two-stage generation method using both extractive and abstractive techniques, in which we first apply name entity recognition (NER) to extract key clinical concepts, which are then used as input for a prompt-tuning-based GatorTronGPT model to generate coherent text for two important sections including “Brief Hospital Course” and “Discharge Instructions”. Our system was ranked 5th in this challenge, achieving an overall score of 0.284. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid solution in improving the quality of automated discharge section generation.",
    "UHGEval: Benchmarking the Hallucination of Chinese Large Language Models via Unconstrained Generation": "Large language models (LLMs) produce hallucinated text, compromising their practical utility in professional contexts. To assess the reliability of LLMs, numerous initiatives have developed benchmark evaluations for hallucination phenomena. However, they often employ constrained generation techniques to produce the evaluation dataset due to cost and time limitations. For instance, this may involve employing directed hallucination induction or deliberately modifying authentic text to generate hallucinations. These are not congruent with the unrestricted text generation demanded by real-world applications. Furthermore, a well-established Chinese-language dataset dedicated to the evaluation of hallucinations is presently lacking. Consequently, we have developed an Unconstrained Hallucination Generation Evaluation (UHGEval) benchmark, containing hallucinations generated by LLMs with minimal restrictions. Concurrently, we have established a comprehensive benchmark evaluation framework to aid subsequent researchers in undertaking scalable and reproducible experiments. We have also evaluated prominent Chinese LLMs and the GPT series models to derive insights regarding hallucination.",
    "UIUC_BioNLP at BioLaySumm: An Extract-then-Summarize Approach Augmented with Wikipedia Knowledge for Biomedical Lay Summarization": "As the number of scientific publications is growing at a rapid pace, it is difficult for laypeople to keep track of and understand the latest scientific advances, especially in the biomedical domain. While the summarization of scientific publications has been widely studied, research on summarization targeting laypeople has remained scarce. In this study, considering the lengthy input of biomedical articles, we have developed a lay summarization system through an extract-then-summarize framework with large language models (LLMs) to summarize biomedical articles for laypeople. Using a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model, our approach achieves the highest overall ranking and demonstrates the best relevance performance in the BioLaySumm 2024 shared task.",

Task 4 involved extracting the clinical and social impacts of non-medical substance use and task 5 focused on the binary classification of tweets reporting children's medical disorders. We employed encoder language models and their ensembles, achieving the top score on task 4 and a high score for task 5.",
    "ULTRA: Unleash LLMs' Potential for Event Argument Extraction through Hierarchical Modeling and Pair-wise Self-Refinement": "Structural extraction of events within discourse is critical since it avails a deeper understanding of communication patterns and behavior trends. Event argument extraction (EAE), at the core of event-centric understanding, is the task of identifying role-specific text spans (i.e., arguments) for a given event. Document-level EAE (DocEAE) focuses on arguments that are scattered across an entire document. In this work, we explore open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for DocEAE, and propose ULTRA, a hierarchical framework that extracts event arguments more cost-effectively. Further, it alleviates the positional bias issue intrinsic to LLMs. ULTRA sequentially reads text chunks of a document to generate a candidate argument set, upon which non-pertinent candidates are dropped through self-refinement. We introduce LEAFER to address the challenge LLMs face in locating the exact boundary of an argument. ULTRA outperforms strong baselines, including strong supervised models and ChatGPT, by 9.8% when evaluated by Exact Match (EM).",
    "UltraEval: A Lightweight Platform for Flexible and Comprehensive Evaluation for LLMs": "Evaluation is pivotal for refining Large Language Models (LLMs), pinpointing their capabilities, and guiding enhancements. The rapid development of LLMs calls for a lightweight and easy-to-use framework for swift evaluation deployment. However, considering various implementation details, developing a comprehensive evaluation platform is never easy. Existing platforms are often complex and poorly modularized, hindering seamless incorporation into research workflows. This paper introduces UltraEval, a user-friendly evaluation framework characterized by its lightweight nature, comprehensiveness, modularity, and efficiency. We identify and reimplement three core components of model evaluation (models, data, and metrics). The resulting composability allows for the free combination of different models, tasks, prompts, benchmarks, and metrics within a unified evaluation workflow. Additionally, UltraEval supports diverse models owing to a unified HTTP service and provides sufficient inference acceleration. UltraEval is now available for researchers publicly.",
    "UltraLink: An Open-Source Knowledge-Enhanced Multilingual Supervised Fine-tuning Dataset": "Open-source large language models (LLMs) have gained significant strength across diverse fields. Nevertheless, the majority of studies primarily concentrate on English, with only limited exploration into the realm of multilingual abilities. In this work, we therefore construct an open-source multilingual supervised fine-tuning dataset. Different from previous works that simply translate English instructions, we consider both the language-specific and language-agnostic abilities of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a knowledge-grounded data augmentation approach to elicit more language-specific knowledge of LLMs, improving their ability to serve users from different countries. Moreover, we find modern LLMs possess strong cross-lingual transfer capabilities, thus repeatedly learning identical content in various languages is not necessary. Consequently, we can substantially prune the language-agnostic supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data without any performance degradation, making multilingual SFT more efficient. The resulting UltraLink dataset comprises approximately 1 million samples across five languages (i.e., En, Zh, Ru, Fr, Es), and the proposed data construction method can be easily extended to other languages. UltraLink-LM, which is trained on the UltraLink dataset, outperforms several representative baselines across many tasks.",
    "Uncertainty Aware Learning for Language Model Alignment": "As instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) evolve, aligning pretrained foundation models presents increasing challenges. Existing alignment strategies, which typically leverage diverse and high-quality data sources, often overlook the intrinsic uncertainty of tasks, learning all data samples equally. This may lead to suboptimal data efficiency and model performance. In response, we propose uncertainty-aware learning (UAL) to improve the model alignment of different task scenarios, by introducing the sample uncertainty (elicited from more capable LLMs). We implement UAL by a simple fashion - adaptively setting the label smoothing value of training according to the uncertainty of individual samples. Analysis shows that our UAL indeed facilitates better token clustering in the feature space, validating our hypothesis. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our UAL significantly and consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning. Notably, LLMs aligned in a mixed scenario have achieved an average improvement of 10.62% on high-entropy tasks (i.e., AlpacaEval leaderboard), and 1.81% on complex low-entropy tasks (i.e., MetaMath and GSM8K).",
    "Uncovering Limitations of Large Language Models in Information Seeking from Tables": "Tables are recognized for their high information density and widespread usage, serving as essential sources of information. Seeking information from tables (TIS) is a crucial capability for Large Language Models (LLMs), serving as the foundation of knowledge-based Q&A systems. However, this field presently suffers from an absence of thorough and reliable evaluation. This paper introduces a more reliable benchmark for Table Information Seeking (TabIS). To avoid the unreliable evaluation caused by text similarity-based metrics, TabIS adopts a single-choice question format (with two options per question) instead of a text generation format. We establish an effective pipeline for generating options, ensuring their difficulty and quality. Experiments conducted on 12 LLMs reveal that while the performance of GPT-4-turbo is marginally satisfactory, both other proprietary and open-source models perform inadequately. Further analysis shows that LLMs exhibit a poor understanding of table structures, and struggle to balance between TIS performance and robustness against pseudo-relevant tables (common in retrieval-augmented systems). These findings uncover the limitations and potential challenges of LLMs in seeking information from tables. We release our data and code to facilitate further research in this field.",
    "Understanding and Patching Compositional Reasoning in LLMs": "LLMs have marked a revolutionary shift, yet they falter when faced with compositional reasoning tasks. Our research embarks on a quest to uncover the root causes of compositional reasoning failures of LLMs, uncovering that most of them stem from the improperly generated or leveraged implicit reasoning results. Inspired by our empirical findings, we resort to Logit Lens and an intervention experiment to dissect the inner hidden states of LLMs. This deep dive reveals that implicit reasoning results indeed surface within middle layers and play a causative role in shaping the final explicit reasoning results. Our exploration further locates multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules within these layers, which emerge as the linchpins in accurate generation and leveraging of implicit reasoning results. Grounded on the above findings, we develop CREME, a lightweight method to patch errors in compositional reasoning via editing the located MHSA modules. Our empirical evidence stands testament to CREME's effectiveness, paving the way for autonomously and continuously enhancing compositional reasoning capabilities in language models.",
    "Understanding Survey Paper Taxonomy about Large Language Models via Graph Representation Learning": "As new research on Large Language Models (LLMs) continues, it is difficult to keep up with new research and models. To help researchers synthesize the new research many have written survey papers, but even those have become numerous. In this paper, we develop a method to automatically assign survey papers to a taxonomy. We collect the metadata of 144 LLM survey papers and explore three paradigms to classify papers within the taxonomy. Our work indicates that leveraging graph structure information on co-category graphs can significantly outperform the language models in two paradigms; pre-trained language models' fine-tuning and zero-shot/few-shot classifications using LLMs. We find that our model surpasses an average human recognition level and that fine-tuning LLMs using weak labels generated by a smaller model, such as the GCN in this study, can be more effective than using ground-truth labels, revealing the potential of weak-to-strong generalization in the taxonomy classification task.",
    "Unexpected Phenomenon: LLMs' Spurious Associations in Information Extraction": "Information extraction plays a critical role in natural language processing. When applying large language models (LLMs) to this domain, we discover an unexpected phenomenon: LLMs' spurious associations. In tasks such as relation extraction, LLMs can accurately identify entity pairs, even if the given relation (label) is semantically unrelated to the pre-defined original one. To find these labels, we design two strategies in this study, including forward label extension and backward label validation. We also leverage the extended labels to improve model performance. Our comprehensive experiments show that spurious associations occur consistently in both Chinese and English datasets across various LLM sizes. Moreover, the use of extended labels significantly enhances LLM performance in information extraction tasks. Remarkably, there is a performance increase of 9.55%, 11.42%, and 21.27% in F1 scores on the SciERC, ACE05, and DuEE datasets, respectively.",
    "UNICODER: Scaling Code Large Language Model via Universal Code": "Intermediate reasoning or acting steps have successfully improved large language models (LLMs) for handling various downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks. When applying LLMs for code generation, recent works mainly focus on directing the models to articulate intermediate natural-language reasoning steps, as in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and then output code with the natural language or other structured intermediate steps. However, such output is not suitable for code translation or generation tasks since the standard CoT has different logical structures and forms of expression with the code. In this work, we introduce the universal code (UniCode) as the intermediate representation. It is a description of algorithm steps using a mix of conventions of programming languages, such as assignment operator, conditional operator, and loop. Hence, we collect an instruction dataset UNICODER-INSTRUCT to train our model UNICODER on multi-task learning objectives. UNICODER-INSTRUCT comprises natural-language questions, code solutions, and the corresponding universal code. The alignment between the intermediate universal code representation and the final code solution significantly improves the quality of the generated code. The experimental results demonstrate that UNICODER with the universal code significantly outperforms the previous prompting methods by a large margin, showcasing the effectiveness of the structural clues in pseudo-code.",
    "Unified Hallucination Detection for Multimodal Large Language Models": "Despite significant strides in multimodal tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are plagued by the critical issue of hallucination. The reliable detection of such hallucinations in MLLMs has, therefore, become a vital aspect of model evaluation and the safeguarding of practical application deployment. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by a narrow focus on singular tasks, an inadequate range of hallucination categories addressed, and a lack of detailed granularity. In response to these challenges, our work expands the investigative horizons of hallucination detection. We present a novel meta-evaluation benchmark, MHaluBench, meticulously crafted to facilitate the evaluation of advancements in hallucination detection methods. Additionally, we unveil a novel unified multimodal hallucination detection framework, UNIHD, which leverages a suite of auxiliary tools to validate the occurrence of hallucinations robustly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UNIHD through meticulous evaluation and comprehensive analysis. We also provide strategic insights on the application of specific tools for addressing various categories of hallucinations.",
    "UNIMO-G: Unified Image Generation through Multimodal Conditional Diffusion": "Existing text-to-image diffusion models primarily generate images from text prompts. However, the inherent conciseness of textual descriptions poses challenges in faithfully synthesizing images with intricate details, such as specific entities or scenes. This paper presents UNIMO-G, a simple multimodal conditional diffusion framework that operates on multimodal prompts with interleaved textual and visual inputs, which demonstrates a unified ability for both text-driven and subject-driven image generation. UNIMO-G comprises two core components: a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for encoding multimodal prompts, and a conditional denoising diffusion network for generating images based on the encoded multimodal input. We leverage a two-stage training strategy to effectively train the framework: firstly pre-training on large-scale text-image pairs to develop conditional image generation capabilities, and then instruction tuning with multimodal prompts to achieve unified image generation proficiency. A well-designed data processing pipeline involving language grounding and image segmentation is employed to construct multi-modal prompts. UNIMO-G excels in both text-to-image generation and zero-shot subject-driven synthesis, and is notably effective in generating high-fidelity images from complex multimodal prompts involving multiple image entities.",
    "Unintended Impacts of LLM Alignment on Global Representation": "Before being deployed for user-facing applications, developers align Large Language Models (LLMs) to user preferences through a variety of procedures, such as Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Current evaluations of these procedures focus on benchmarks of instruction following, reasoning, and truthfulness. However, human preferences are not universal, and aligning to specific preference sets may have unintended effects. We explore how alignment impacts performance along three axes of global representation: English dialects, multilingualism, and opinions from and about countries worldwide. Our results show that current alignment procedures create disparities between English dialects and global opinions. We find alignment improves capabilities in several languages. We conclude by discussing design decisions that led to these unintended impacts and recommendations for more equitable preference tuning. We make our code and data publicly available on Github.",
    "UNIWIZ: A Unified Large Language Model Orchestrated Wizard for Safe Knowledge Grounded Conversations": "Warning: This paper contains disturbing language. Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in integrating safety and knowledge alignment. However, adversarial actors can manipulate these models into generating unsafe responses, and excessive safety alignment can lead to unintended hallucinations. To address these challenges, we introduce UNIWIZ, a novel 2-step data orchestration framework that unifies safety and knowledge data generation. We propose a safety-priming method to generate synthetic safety data and overcome safety bottlenecks. We also inject relevant knowledge into conversations by retrieving factual information from curated sources. UNIWIZ dataset consists of 17,638 quality-controlled conversations and 10,000 augmented preference data. Pretrained models fine-tuned on UNIWIZ show improvements across various metrics and outperform state-of-the-art instruction-tuned models trained on much larger datasets.",
    "Unlearning Climate Misinformation in Large Language Models": "Misinformation regarding climate change is a key roadblock in addressing one of the most serious threats to humanity. This paper investigates factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs) regarding climate information. Using true/false labeled Q&A data for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs on climate-related claims, we compare open-source models, assessing their ability to generate truthful responses to climate change questions. We investigate the detectability of models intentionally poisoned with false climate information, finding that such poisoning may not affect the accuracy of a model's responses in other domains. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of unlearning algorithms, fine-tuning, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for factually grounding LLMs on climate change topics. Our evaluation reveals that unlearning algorithms can be effective for nuanced conceptual claims, despite previous findings suggesting their inefficacy in privacy contexts. These insights aim to guide the development of more factually reliable LLMs and highlight the need for additional work to secure LLMs against misinformation attacks.",
    "Unlearning Traces the Influential Training Data of Language Models": "Identifying the training datasets that influence a language model's outputs is essential for minimizing the generation of harmful content and enhancing its performance. Ideally, we can measure the influence of each dataset by removing it from training; however, it is prohibitively expensive to retrain a model multiple times. This paper presents UnTrac: Unlearning Traces the influence of a training dataset on the model's performance. UnTrac is extremely simple; each training dataset is unlearned by gradient ascent, and we evaluate how much the model's predictions change after unlearning. Furthermore, we propose a more scalable approach, UnTrac-Inv, which unlearns a test dataset and evaluates the unlearned model on training datasets. UnTrac-Inv resembles UnTrac, while being efficient for massive training datasets. In the experiments, we examine if our methods can assess the influence of pretraining datasets on generating toxic, biased, and untruthful content. Our methods estimate their influence much more accurately than existing methods while requiring neither excessive memory space nor multiple checkpoints.",
    "Unlocking Data-free Low-bit Quantization with Matrix Decomposition for KV Cache Compression": "Key-value (KV) caching is an important technique to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs), but incurs significant memory overhead. To compress the size of KV cache, existing methods often compromise precision or require extra data for calibration, limiting their practicality in LLM deployment. In this paper, we introduce DecoQuant, a novel data-free low-bit quantization technique based on tensor decomposition methods, to effectively compress KV cache. Our core idea is to adjust the outlier distribution of the original matrix by performing tensor decomposition, so that the quantization difficulties are migrated from the matrix to decomposed local tensors. Specially, we find that outliers mainly concentrate on small local tensors, while large tensors tend to have a narrower value range. Based on this finding, we propose to apply low-bit quantization to the large tensor, while maintaining high-precision representation for the small tensor. Furthermore, we utilize the proposed quantization method to compress the KV cache of LLMs to accelerate the inference and develop an efficient dequantization kernel tailored specifically for DecoQuant. Through extensive experiments, DecoQuant demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains, showcasing up to a ∼75% reduction in memory footprint while maintaining comparable generation quality.",
    "Unlocking Efficiency in Large Language Model Inference: A Comprehensive Survey of Speculative Decoding": "To mitigate the high inference latency stemming from autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs), Speculative Decoding has emerged as a novel decoding paradigm for LLM inference. In each decoding step, this method first drafts several future tokens efficiently and then verifies them in parallel. Unlike autoregressive decoding, Speculative Decoding facilitates the simultaneous decoding of multiple tokens per step, thereby accelerating inference. This paper presents a comprehensive overview and analysis of this promising decoding paradigm. We begin by providing a formal definition and formulation of Speculative Decoding. Then, we organize in-depth discussions on its key facets, such as drafter selection and verification strategies. Furthermore, we present a comparative analysis of leading methods under third-party testing environments. We aim for this work to serve as a catalyst for further research on Speculative Decoding, ultimately contributing to more efficient LLM inference.",
    "Unlocking the Potential of Large Language Models for Clinical Text Anonymization: A Comparative Study": "Automated clinical text anonymization has the potential to unlock the widespread sharing of textual health data for secondary usage while assuring patient privacy. Despite the proposal of many complex and theoretically successful anonymization solutions in literature, these techniques remain flawed. As such, clinical institutions are still reluctant to apply them for open access to their data. Recent advances in developing Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a promising opportunity to further the field, given their capability to perform various tasks. This paper proposes six new evaluation metrics tailored to the challenges of generative anonymization with LLMs. Moreover, we present a comparative study of LLM-based methods, testing them against two baseline techniques. Our results establish LLM-based models as a reliable alternative to common approaches, paving the way toward trustworthy anonymization of clinical text.",
    "Unlocking the Power of Large Language Models for Entity Alignment": "Entity Alignment (EA) is vital for integrating diverse knowledge graph (KG) data, playing a crucial role in data-driven AI applications. Traditional EA methods primarily rely on comparing entity embeddings, but their effectiveness is constrained by the limited input KG data and the capabilities of the representation learning techniques. Against this backdrop, we introduce ChatEA, an innovative framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) to improve EA. To address the constraints of limited input KG data, ChatEA introduces a KG-code translation module that translates KG structures into a format understandable by LLMs, thereby allowing LLMs to utilize their extensive background knowledge to improve EA accuracy. To overcome the over-reliance on entity embedding comparisons, ChatEA implements a two-stage EA strategy that capitalizes on LLMs' capability for multi-step reasoning in a dialogue format, thereby enhancing accuracy while preserving efficiency. Our experimental results verify ChatEA's superior performance, highlighting LLMs' potential in facilitating EA tasks. The source code is available at https://github.com/jxh4945777/ChatEA/.",
    "Unraveling and Mitigating Retriever Inconsistencies in Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models": "Although Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RALMs) demonstrate their superiority in terms of factuality, they do not consistently outperform the original retrieval-free Language Models (LMs). Our experiments reveal that this example-level performance inconsistency exists not only between retrieval-augmented and retrieval-free LM but also among different retrievers. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate the degeneration behavior of RALMs and theoretically decompose it into four categories. Further analysis based on our decomposition reveals that the innate difference in knowledge sources and the unpredictable degeneration of the reader model contribute most to the inconsistency. Drawing from our analysis, we introduce Ensemble of Retrievers (EoR), a trainable framework that can adaptively retrieve from different knowledge sources and effectively decrease unpredictable reader errors. Our experiments on Open Domain Question Answering show that EoR substantially improves performance over the RALM with a single retriever by considerably reducing inconsistent behaviors.",
    "Unsupervised Distractor Generation via Large Language Model Distilling and Counterfactual Contrastive Decoding": "Within the context of reading comprehension, the task of Distractor Generation (DG) aims to generate several incorrect options to confuse readers. Traditional supervised methods for DG rely heavily on expensive human-annotated distractor labels. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised DG framework, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as cost-effective annotators to enhance the DG capability of smaller student models. Specially, to perform knowledge distilling, we propose a dual task training strategy that integrates pseudo distractors from LLMs and the original answer information as the objective targets with a two-stage training process. Moreover, we devise a counterfactual contrastive decoding mechanism for increasing the distracting capability of the DG model. Experiments show that our unsupervised generation method with Bart-base greatly surpasses GPT-3.5-turbo performance with only 200× fewer model parameters. Our proposed unsupervised DG method offers a cost-effective framework for practical reading comprehension applications, without the need of laborious distractor annotation and costly large-size models.",
    "Unsupervised Information Refinement Training of Large Language Models for Retrieval-Augmented Generation": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating additional information from retrieval. However, studies have shown that LLMs still face challenges in effectively using the retrieved information, even ignoring it or being misled by it. The key reason is that the training of LLMs does not clearly make LLMs learn how to utilize input retrieved texts with varied quality. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective that considers the role of LLMs in RAG as “Information Refiner”, which means that regardless of correctness, completeness, or usefulness of retrieved texts, LLMs can consistently integrate knowledge within the retrieved texts and model parameters to generate the texts that are more concise, accurate, and complete than the retrieved texts. To this end, we propose an information refinement training method named INFO-RAG that optimizes LLMs for RAG in an unsupervised manner. INFO-RAG is low-cost and general across various tasks. Extensive experiments on zero-shot prediction of 11 datasets in diverse tasks including Question Answering, Slot-Filling, Language Modeling, Dialogue, and Code Generation show that INFO-RAG improves the performance of LLaMA2 by an average of 9.39% relative points. INFO-RAG also shows advantages in in-context learning and robustness of RAG.",
    "Unsupervised Real-Time Hallucination Detection based on the Internal States of Large Language Models": "Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) refer to the phenomenon of LLMs producing responses that are coherent yet factually inaccurate. This issue undermines the effectiveness of LLMs in practical applications, necessitating research into detecting and mitigating hallucinations of LLMs. Previous studies have mainly concentrated on post-processing techniques for hallucination detection, which tend to be computationally intensive and limited in effectiveness due to their separation from the LLM's inference process. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MIND, an unsupervised training framework that leverages the internal states of LLMs for real-time hallucination detection without requiring manual annotations. Additionally, we present HELM, a new benchmark for evaluating hallucination detection across multiple LLMs, featuring diverse LLM outputs and the internal states of LLMs during their inference process. Our experiments demonstrate that MIND outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in hallucination detection.",
    "Unveiling Imitation Learning: Exploring the Impact of Data Falsity to Large Language Model": "Many recent studies endeavor to improve open-source language models through imitation learning, and re-training on the synthetic instruction data from state-of-the-art proprietary models like ChatGPT and GPT-4. However, the innate nature of synthetic data inherently contains noisy data, giving rise to a substantial presence of low-quality data replete with erroneous responses, and flawed reasoning. Although we intuitively grasp the potential harm of noisy data, we lack a quantitative understanding of its impact. To this end, this paper explores the correlation between the degree of noise and its impact on language models through instruction tuning. We first introduce the Falsity-Controllable (FACO) dataset, which comprises pairs of true answers with corresponding reasoning, as well as false pairs to manually control the falsity ratio of the dataset. Through our extensive experiments, we found multiple intriguing findings of the correlation between the factuality of the dataset and instruction tuning: Specifically, we verified falsity of the instruction is highly relevant to various benchmark scores. Moreover, when LLMs are trained with false instructions, they learn to lie and generate fake unfaithful answers, even though they know the correct answer for the user request. Additionally, we noted that once the language model is trained with a dataset contaminated by noise, restoring its original performance is possible, but it failed to reach full performance.",
    "Unveiling Linguistic Regions in Large Language Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable cross-lingual alignment and generalization ability. Current research primarily focuses on improving LLMs' cross-lingual generalization capabilities. However, there is still a lack of research on the intrinsic mechanisms of how LLMs achieve cross-lingual alignment. From the perspective of region partitioning, this paper conducts several investigations on the linguistic competence of LLMs. We discover a core region in LLMs that corresponds to linguistic competence, accounting for approximately 1% of the total model parameters. Removing this core region by setting parameters to zero results in a significant performance decrease across 30 different languages. Furthermore, this core region exhibits significant dimensional dependence, perturbations to even a single parameter on specific dimensions leading to a loss of linguistic competence. Moreover, we discover that distinct monolingual regions exist for different languages, and disruption to these specific regions substantially reduces the LLMs' proficiency in those corresponding languages. Our research also indicates that freezing the core linguistic region during further pre-training can mitigate the issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF), a common phenomenon observed during further pre-training of LLMs. Overall, exploring the LLMs' functional regions provides insights into the foundation of their intelligence.",
    "Unveiling Selection Biases: Exploring Order and Token Sensitivity in Large Language Models": "In this paper, we investigate the phenomena of selection biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on problems where models are tasked with choosing the optimal option from an ordered sequence. We delve into biases related to option order and token usage, which significantly impact LLMs' decision-making processes. We also quantify the impact of these biases through an extensive empirical analysis across multiple models and tasks. Furthermore, we propose mitigation strategies to enhance model performance. Our key contributions are threefold: 1) Precisely quantifying the influence of option order and token on LLMs, 2) Developing strategies to mitigate the impact of token and order sensitivity to enhance robustness, and 3) Offering a detailed analysis of sensitivity across models and tasks, which informs the creation of more stable and reliable LLM applications for selection problems.",
    "Unveiling the Achilles' Heel of NLG Evaluators: A Unified Adversarial Framework Driven by Large Language Models": "The automatic evaluation of natural language generation (NLG) systems presents a long-lasting challenge. Recent studies have highlighted various neural metrics that align well with human evaluations. Yet, the robustness of these evaluators against adversarial perturbations remains largely under-explored due to the unique challenges in obtaining adversarial data for different NLG evaluation tasks. To address the problem, we introduce AdvEval, a novel black-box adversarial framework against NLG evaluators. AdvEval is specially tailored to generate data that yield strong disagreements between human and victim evaluators. Specifically, inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in text generation and evaluation, we adopt strong LLMs as both the data generator and gold evaluator. Adversarial data are automatically optimized with feedback from the gold and victim evaluator. We conduct experiments on 12 victim evaluators and 11 NLG datasets, spanning tasks including dialogue, summarization, and question evaluation. The results show that AdvEval can lead to significant performance degradation of various victim metrics, thereby validating its efficacy.",
    "Unveiling the Art of Heading Design: A Harmonious Blend of Summarization, Neology, and Algorithm": "Crafting an appealing heading is crucial for attracting readers and marketing work or products. A popular way is to summarize the main idea with a refined description and a memorable acronym. However, there lacks a systematic study and a formal benchmark including datasets and metrics. Motivated by this absence, we introduce (LOGOGRAM), a novel benchmark comprising 6,653 paper abstracts with corresponding descriptions and acronyms. To measure the quality of heading generation, we propose a set of evaluation metrics from three aspects: summarization, neology, and algorithm. Additionally, we explore three strategies for heading generation (generation ordering, tokenization of acronyms, and framework design) under various prevalent learning paradigms (supervised fine-tuning, in-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs), and reinforcement learning) on our benchmark. Our experimental results indicate the difficulty in identifying a practice that excels across all summarization, neologistic, and algorithmic aspects.",
    "Unveiling the Spectrum of Data Contamination in Language Models: A Survey from Detection to Remediation": "Data contamination has garnered increased attention in the era of large language models (LLMs) due to the reliance on extensive internet-derived training corpora. The issue of training corpus overlap with evaluation benchmarks—referred to as contamination—has been the focus of significant recent research. This body of work aims to identify contamination, understand its impacts, and explore mitigation strategies from diverse perspectives. However, comprehensive studies that provide a clear pathway from foundational concepts to advanced insights are lacking in this nascent field. Therefore, we present the first survey in the field of data contamination. We begin by examining the effects of data contamination across various stages and forms. We then provide a detailed analysis of current contamination detection methods, categorizing them to highlight their focus, assumptions, strengths, and limitations. We also discuss mitigation strategies, offering a clear guide for future research. This survey serves as a succinct overview of the most recent advancements in data contamination research, providing a straightforward guide for the benefit of future research endeavors.",
    "Unveiling the Truth and Facilitating Change: Towards Agent-based Large-scale Social Movement Simulation": "Social media has emerged as a cornerstone of social movements, wielding significant influence in driving societal change. Simulating the response of the public and forecasting the potential impact has become increasingly important. However, existing methods for simulating such phenomena encounter challenges concerning their efficacy and efficiency in capturing the behaviors of social movement participants. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid framework for social media user simulation, wherein users are categorized into two types. Core users are driven by Large Language Models, while numerous ordinary users are modeled by deductive agent-based models. We further construct a Twitter-like environment to replicate their response dynamics following trigger events. Subsequently, we develop a multi-faceted benchmark SoMoSiMu-Bench for evaluation and conduct comprehensive experiments across real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our method.",
    "UOR: Universal Backdoor Attacks on Pre-trained Language Models": "Task-agnostic and transferable backdoors implanted in pre-trained language models (PLMs) pose a severe security threat as they can be inherited to any downstream task. However, existing methods rely on manual selection of triggers and backdoor representations, hindering their effectiveness and universality across different PLMs or usage paradigms. In this paper, we propose a new backdoor attack method called UOR, which overcomes these limitations by turning manual selection into automatic optimization. Specifically, we design poisoned supervised contrastive learning, which can automatically learn more uniform and universal backdoor representations. This allows for more even coverage of the output space, thus hitting more labels in downstream tasks after fine-tuning. Furthermore, we utilize gradient search to select appropriate trigger words that can be adapted to different PLMs and vocabularies. Experiments show that UOR achieves better attack performance on various text classification tasks compared to manual methods. Moreover, we test on PLMs with different architectures, usage paradigms, and more challenging tasks, achieving higher scores for universality.",
    "Upaya at ArabicNLU2024: Arabic Lexical Disambiguation using Large Language Models": "Disambiguating a word's intended meaning (sense) in a given context is important in Natural Language Understanding (NLU). WSD aims to determine the correct sense of ambiguous words in context. At the same time, LMD (a WSD variation) focuses on disambiguating location mention. Both tasks are vital in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and information retrieval, as they help correctly interpret and extract information from text. Arabic version is further challenging because of its morphological richness, encompassing a complex interplay of roots, stems, and affixes. This paper describes our solutions to both tasks, employing Llama3 and Cohere-based models under Zero-Shot Learning and Re-Ranking, respectively. Both the shared tasks were part of the second Arabic Natural Language Processing Conference co-located with ACL 2024. Overall, we achieved 1st rank in the WSD task (accuracy 78%) and 2nd rank in the LMD task (MRR@1 0.59).",
    "URG: A Unified Ranking and Generation Method for Ensembling Language Models": "Prior research endeavors of the ensemble Large Language Models (LLMs) achieved great success by employing an individual language model (LM) rank before the text generation. However, the use of an individual LM ranker faces two primary challenges: (1) The time-intensive nature of the ranking process, stemming from the comparisons between models; (2) The issue of error propagation arising from the separate ranking and generation models within the framework. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose a novel ensemble framework, namely Unified Ranking and Generation (URG). URG represents an end-to-end framework that jointly ranks the outputs of LLMs and generates fine-grained fusion results, via utilizing a dedicated cross-attention-based module and noise mitigation training against irrelevant information stemming from bad ranking results. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework in both the ranking and generation tasks. With the close coordination of the ranking and generation modules, our end-to-end framework achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on these tasks, and exhibits substantial enhancements to any of the ensembled models.",
    "Using Large Language Models to Evaluate Biomedical Query-Focused Summarisation": "Biomedical question-answering systems remain popular for biomedical experts interacting with the literature to answer their medical questions. However, these systems are difficult to evaluate in the absence of costly human experts. Therefore, automatic evaluation metrics are often used in this space. Traditional automatic metrics such as ROUGE or BLEU, which rely on token overlap, have shown a low correlation with humans. We present a study that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically evaluate systems from an international challenge on biomedical semantic indexing and question answering, called BioASQ. We measure the agreement of LLM-produced scores against human judgements. We show that LLMs correlate similarly to lexical methods when using basic prompting techniques. However, by aggregating evaluators with LLMs or by fine-tuning, we find that our methods outperform the baselines by a large margin, achieving a Spearman correlation of 0.501 and 0.511, respectively.",
    "Using LLMs to Build a Database of Climate Extreme Impacts": "To better understand how extreme climate events impact society, we need to increase the availability of accurate and comprehensive information about these impacts. We propose a method for building large-scale databases of climate extreme impacts from online textual sources, using LLMs for information extraction in combination with more traditional NLP techniques to improve accuracy and consistency. We evaluate the method against a small benchmark database created by human experts and find that extraction accuracy varies for different types of information. We compare three different LLMs and find that, while the commercial GPT-4 model gives the best performance overall, the open-source models Mistral and Mixtral are competitive for some types of information.",
    "Using Natural Language Explanations to Improve Robustness of In-context Learning": "Recent studies demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can excel in many tasks via in-context learning (ICL). However, recent works show that ICL-prompted models tend to produce inaccurate results when presented with adversarial inputs. In this work, we investigate whether augmenting ICL with natural language explanations (NLEs) improves the robustness of LLMs on adversarial datasets covering natural language inference and paraphrasing identification. We prompt LLMs with a small set of human-generated NLEs to produce further NLEs, yielding more accurate results than both a zero-shot-ICL setting and using only human-generated NLEs. Our results on five popular LLMs (GPT3.5-turbo, Llama2, Vicuna, Zephyr, and Mistral) show that our approach yields over 6% improvement over baseline approaches for eight adversarial datasets: HANS, ISCS, NaN, ST, PICD, PISP, ANLI, and PAWS. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that prompt selection strategies significantly enhance ICL on in-distribution test sets. However, our findings reveal that these strategies do not match the efficacy of our approach for robustness evaluations, resulting in an accuracy drop of 8% compared to the proposed approach.",
    "UWB at WASSA-2024 Shared Task 2: Cross-lingual Emotion Detection": "This paper presents our system built for the WASSA-2024 Cross-lingual Emotion Detection Shared Task. The task consists of two subtasks: first, to assess an emotion label from six possible classes for a given tweet in one of five languages, and second, to predict words triggering the detected emotions in binary and numerical formats. Our proposed approach revolves around fine-tuning quantized large language models, specifically Orca 2, with low-rank adapters (LoRA) and multilingual Transformer-based models, such as XLM-R and mT5. We enhance performance through machine translation for both subtasks and trigger word switching for the second subtask. The system achieves excellent performance, ranking 1st in numerical trigger words detection, 3rd in binary trigger words detection, and 7th in emotion detection.",
    "VALOR-EVAL: Holistic Coverage and Faithfulness Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from hallucination issues, wherein the models generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect outputs, undermining their reliability. A comprehensive quantitative evaluation is necessary to identify and understand the extent of hallucinations in these models. However, existing benchmarks are often limited in scope, focusing mainly on object hallucinations. Furthermore, current evaluation methods struggle to effectively address the subtle semantic distinctions between model outputs and reference data, as well as the balance between hallucination and informativeness. To address these issues, we introduce a multi-dimensional benchmark covering objects, attributes, and relations, with challenging images selected based on associative biases. Moreover, we propose a large language model (LLM)-based two-stage evaluation framework that generalizes the popular CHAIR metric (Rohrbach et al., 2018) and incorporates both faithfulness and coverage into the evaluation. Experiments on 10 established LVLMs demonstrate that our evaluation metric is more comprehensive and better correlated with humans than existing work when evaluating on our challenging human-annotated benchmark dataset. Our work also highlights the critical balance between faithfulness and coverage of model outputs, and encourages future works to address hallucinations in LVLMs while keeping their outputs informative.",
    "ValueBench: Towards Comprehensively Evaluating Value Orientations and Understanding of Large Language Models": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming diverse fields and gaining increasing influence as human proxies. This development underscores the urgent need for evaluating value orientations and understanding of LLMs to ensure their responsible integration into public-facing applications. This work introduces ValueBench, the first comprehensive psychometric benchmark for evaluating value orientations and value understanding in LLMs. ValueBench collects data from 44 established psychometric inventories, encompassing 453 multifaceted value dimensions. We propose an evaluation pipeline grounded in realistic human-AI interactions to probe value orientations, along with novel tasks for evaluating value understanding in an open-ended value space. With extensive experiments conducted on six representative LLMs, we unveil their shared and distinctive value orientations and exhibit their ability to approximate expert conclusions in value-related extraction and generation tasks. ValueBench is openly accessible at https://github.com/Value4AI/ValueBench.",
    "VARIERR NLI: Separating Annotation Error from Human Label Variation": "Human label variation arises when annotators assign different labels to the same item for valid reasons, while annotation errors occur when labels are assigned for invalid reasons. These two issues are prevalent in NLP benchmarks, yet existing research has studied them in isolation. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no prior work that focuses on teasing apart error from signal, especially in cases where signal is beyond black-and-white. To fill this gap, we introduce a systematic methodology and a new dataset, VARIERR (variation versus error), focusing on the NLI task in English. We propose a 2-round annotation procedure with annotators explaining each label and subsequently judging the validity of label-explanation pairs. VARIERR contains 7,732 validity judgments on 1,933 explanations for 500 re-annotated MNLI items. We assess the effectiveness of various automatic error detection (AED) methods and GPTs in uncovering errors versus human label variation. We find that state-of-the-art AED methods significantly underperform GPTs and humans. While GPT-4 is the best system, it still falls short of human performance. Our methodology is applicable beyond NLI, offering fertile ground for future research on error versus plausible variation, which in turn can yield better and more trustworthy NLP systems.",
    "VeraCT Scan: Retrieval-Augmented Fake News Detection with Justifiable Reasoning": "The proliferation of fake news poses a significant threat not only by disseminating misleading information but also by undermining the very foundations of democracy. The recent advance of generative artificial intelligence has further exacerbated the challenge of distinguishing genuine news from fabricated stories. In response to this challenge, we introduce VeraCT Scan, a novel retrieval-augmented system for fake news detection. This system operates by extracting the core facts from a given piece of news and subsequently conducting an internet-wide search to identify corroborating or conflicting reports. Then sources' credibility is leveraged for information verification. Besides determining the veracity of news, we also provide transparent evidence and reasoning to support its conclusions, resulting in the interpretability and trust in the results. In addition to GPT-4 Turbo, Llama-2 13B is also fine-tuned for news content understanding, information verification, and reasoning. Both implementations have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy in the realm of fake news detection.",
    "Verifiable Generation with Subsentence-Level Fine-Grained Citations": "Verifiable generation requires large language models (LLMs) to cite source documents supporting their outputs, thereby improving output transparency and trustworthiness. Yet, previous work mainly targets the generation of sentence-level citations, lacking specificity about which part of the sentence is backed by which cited source. This work studies verifiable generation with subsentence-level fine-grained citations to locate the generated content that is supported by the cited sources in a more precise way. We first present a dataset, SCIFI, comprising 10K Wikipedia paragraphs with subsentence-level citations. Each paragraph in SCIFI is paired with a set of candidate source documents for citation and a query that triggers the generation of the paragraph content. On SCIFI, we then evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and strategies for processing long documents designed for these models. Our experiment results reveal key factors that can enhance the quality of citations, including the expansion of the source documents' context to be accessible to the models and the implementation of specialized model tuning.",
    "VERIFINER: Verification-augmented NER via Knowledge-grounded Reasoning with Large Language Models": "Recent approaches in domain-specific named entity recognition (NER), such as biomedical NER, have shown remarkable advances. However, they still lack of faithfulness, producing erroneous predictions. We assume that knowledge of entities can be useful in verifying the correctness of the predictions. Despite the usefulness of knowledge, resolving such errors with knowledge is nontrivial, since the knowledge itself does not directly indicate the ground-truth label.  To this end, we propose VERIFINER, a post-hoc verification framework that identifies errors from existing NER methods using knowledge and revises them into more faithful predictions. Our framework leverages the reasoning abilities of large language models to adequately ground on knowledge and the contextual information in the verification process. We validate effectiveness of VERIFINER through extensive experiments on biomedical datasets. The results suggest that VERIFINER can successfully verify errors from existing models as a model-agnostic approach. Further analyses on out-of-domain and low-resource settings show the usefulness of VERIFINER on real-world applications.",
    "ViCor: Bridging Visual Understanding and Commonsense Reasoning with Large Language Models": "In our work, we explore the synergistic capabilities of pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) on visual commonsense reasoning (VCR) problems. We find that VLMs and LLMs-based decision pipelines are good at different kinds of VCR problems. Pre-trained VLMs exhibit strong performance for problems involving understanding the literal visual content, which we noted as visual commonsense understanding (VCU). For problems where the goal is to infer conclusions beyond image content, which we noted as visual commonsense inference (VCI), VLMs face difficulties, while LLMs, given sufficient visual evidence, can use commonsense to infer the answer well. We empirically validate this by letting LLMs classify VCR problems into these two categories and show the significant difference between VLM and LLM with image caption decision pipelines on two subproblems. Moreover, we identify a challenge with VLMs' passive perception, which may miss crucial context information, leading to incorrect reasoning by LLMs. Based on these, we suggest a collaborative approach, named ViCor, where pre-trained LLMs serve as problem classifiers to analyze the problem category, then either use VLMs to answer the question directly or actively instruct VLMs to concentrate on and gather relevant visual elements to support potential commonsense inferences. We evaluate our framework on two VCR benchmark datasets and outperform all other methods without in-domain fine-tuning.",
    "Video-ChatGPT: Towards Detailed Video Understanding via Large Vision and Language Models": "Conversation agents fueled by Large Language Models (LLMs) are providing a new way to interact with visual data. While there have been initial attempts for image-based conversation models, this work addresses the under-explored field of video-based conversation by introducing Video-ChatGPT. It is a multimodal model that merges a video-adapted visual encoder with an LLM. The resulting model is capable of understanding and generating detailed conversations about videos. We introduce a new dataset of 100,000 video-instruction pairs used to train Video-ChatGPT acquired via manual and semi-automated pipeline that is easily scalable and robust to label noise. We also develop a quantitative evaluation framework for video-based dialogue models to objectively analyze the strengths and weaknesses of video-based dialogue models.",
    "VideoCoT: A Video Chain-of-Thought Dataset with Active Annotation Tool": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are flourishing, but mainly focus on images with less attention than videos, especially in sub-fields such as prompt engineering, video chain-of-thought (CoT), and instruction tuning on videos. Therefore, we try to explore the collection of CoT datasets in videos to lead to video OpenQA and improve the reasoning ability of MLLMs. Unfortunately, making such video CoT datasets is not an easy task. Given that human annotation is too cumbersome and expensive, while machine-generated is not reliable due to the hallucination issue, we develop an automatic annotation tool that combines machine and human experts, under the active learning paradigm. Active learning is an interactive strategy between the model and human experts, in this way, the workload of human labeling can be reduced and the quality of the dataset can be guaranteed. With the help of the automatic annotation tool, we strive to contribute three datasets, namely VideoCoT, TopicQA, TopicCoT. Furthermore, we propose a simple but effective benchmark based on the collected datasets, which exploits CoT to maximize the complex reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness our solution.",
    "VIEScore: Towards Explainable Metrics for Conditional Image Synthesis Evaluation": "In the rapidly advancing field of conditional image generation research, challenges such as limited explainability lie in effectively evaluating the performance and capabilities of various models. This paper introduces VIESCORE, a Visual Instruction-guided Explainable metric for evaluating any conditional image generation tasks. VIESCORE leverages general knowledge from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as the backbone and does not require training or fine-tuning. We evaluate VIESCORE on seven prominent tasks in conditional image tasks and found: (1) VIESCORE (GPT4-o) achieves a high Spearman correlation of 0.4 with human evaluations, while the human-to-human correlation is 0.45. (2) VIESCORE (with open-source MLLM) is significantly weaker than GPT-4o and GPT-4v in evaluating synthetic images. (3) VIESCORE achieves a correlation on par with human ratings in the generation tasks but struggles in editing tasks. With these results, we believe VIESCORE shows its great potential to replace human judges in evaluating image synthesis tasks.",
    "Views Are My Own, but Also Yours: Benchmarking Theory of Mind Using Common Ground": "Evaluating the theory of mind (ToM) capabilities of language models (LMs) has recently received a great deal of attention. However, many existing benchmarks rely on synthetic data, which risks misaligning the resulting experiments with human behavior. We introduce the first ToM dataset based on naturally occurring spoken dialogs, COMMON-TOM, and show that LMs struggle to demonstrate ToM. We then show that integrating a simple, explicit representation of beliefs improves LM performance on COMMON-TOM.",
    "VIHATET5: Enhancing Hate Speech Detection in Vietnamese With a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer Model": "Recent advancements in hate speech detection (HSD) in Vietnamese have made significant progress, primarily attributed to the emergence of transformer-based pre-trained language models, particularly those built on the BERT architecture. However, the necessity for specialized fine-tuned models has resulted in the complexity and fragmentation of developing a multitasking HSD system. Moreover, most current methodologies focus on fine-tuning general pre-trained models, primarily trained on formal textual datasets like Wikipedia, which may not accurately capture human behavior on online platforms. In this research, we introduce VIHATET5, a T5-based model pre-trained on our proposed large-scale domain-specific dataset named VOZ-HSD. By harnessing the power of a text-to-text architecture, VIHATET5 can tackle multiple tasks using a unified model and obtain state-of-the-art performance on all benchmark HSD datasets in Vietnamese. The experiments also underscore the significance of label distribution in pre-training data on model efficacy. We provide our experimental materials for research purposes, including the VOZ-HSD dataset, pre-trained checkpoint, the unified HSD-multitask VIHATET5 model, and related source code on GitHub publicly.",
    "ViMedAQA: A Vietnamese Medical Abstractive Question-Answering Dataset and Findings of Large Language Model": "Question answering involves creating answers to questions. With the growth of large language models, the ability of question-answering systems has dramatically improved. However, there is a lack of Vietnamese abstractive question-answering datasets, especially in the medical domain. Therefore, this research aims to mitigate this gap by introducing ViMedAQA 1. This Vietnamese Medical Abstractive Question-Answering dataset covers four topics in the Vietnamese medical domain, including body parts, disease, drugs, and medicine. Additionally, the empirical results on the proposed dataset examine the capability of the large language models in the Vietnamese medical domain, including reasoning, memorizing, and awareness of essential information.",
    "Virtual Compiler Is All You Need For Assembly Code Search": "Assembly code search is vital for reducing the burden on reverse engineers, allowing them to quickly identify specific functions using natural language within vast binary programs. Despite its significance, this critical task is impeded by the complexities involved in building high-quality datasets. This paper explores training a Large Language Model (LLM) to emulate a general compiler. By leveraging Ubuntu packages to compile a dataset of 20 billion tokens, we further continue pre-train CodeLlama as a Virtual Compiler (ViC), capable of compiling any source code of any language to assembly code. This approach allows for virtual compilation across a wide range of programming languages without the need for a real compiler, preserving semantic equivalency and expanding the possibilities for assembly code dataset construction. Furthermore, we use ViC to construct a sufficiently large dataset for assembly code search. Employing this extensive dataset, we achieve a substantial improvement in assembly code search performance, with our model surpassing the leading baseline by 26%.",
    "VisDiaHalBench: A Visual Dialogue Benchmark For Diagnosing Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models": "Despite the significant success of large vision-language models (LVLMs), some studies have revealed that LVLMs suffer from the hallucination problem, where the LVLMs' response contains descriptions of non-existent objects. Although various benchmarks have been proposed to investigate this problem, they mostly focus on single-turn evaluation and overlook the hallucination raised by textual inputs. To investigate the hallucination problem of LVLMs when given long-term misleading textual history, we propose a novel visual dialogue hallucination evaluation benchmark VisDiaHalBench. The benchmark consists of samples with five-turn questions about an edited image and its original version. VisDiaHalBench differs from previous hallucination benchmarks in the following three points: 1) The questions and answers are unambiguously grounded by annotated scene graphs. 2) The images are uncommonly edited to inspect the visual model and common-object hallucination in LLMs. 3) The carefully designed dialogue refers to the same object in different turns to assess the image consistency and influence of history for LVLMs. The detailed analysis of several state-of-the-art LVLMs across image consistency, visual understanding, history influence, and other dimensions reveals their substantial performance gap with single-turn VQA tasks. The benchmark is released in: https://github.com/qingxingcao/VisDiaHalBench",
    "Vision-Flan: Scaling Human-Labeled Tasks in Visual Instruction Tuning": "Despite vision-language models' (VLMs) remarkable capabilities as versatile visual assistants, two substantial challenges persist within the existing VLM frameworks: (1) lacking task diversity in pretraining and visual instruction tuning, and (2) annotation error and bias in GPT-4 synthesized instruction tuning data. Both challenges lead to issues such as poor generalizability, hallucination, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we construct VISION-FLAN, the most diverse publicly available visual instruction tuning dataset to date, comprising 187 diverse tasks and 1,664,261 instances sourced from academic datasets, and each task is accompanied by an expert-written instruction. In addition, we propose a two-stage instruction tuning framework, in which VLMs are firstly finetuned on VISION-FLAN and further tuned on GPT-4 synthesized data. We find this two-stage tuning framework significantly outperforms the traditional single-stage visual instruction tuning framework and achieves the state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of multi-modal evaluation benchmarks. Finally, we conduct in-depth analyses to understand visual instruction tuning and our findings reveal that: (1) GPT-4 synthesized data does not substantially enhance VLMs' capabilities but rather modulates the model's responses to human-preferred formats; (2) A minimal quantity (e.g., 1,000) of GPT-4 synthesized data can effectively align VLM responses with human-preference; (3) Visual instruction tuning mainly helps large-language models (LLMs) to understand visual features. Our dataset and models are publicly available at https://github.com/VT-NLP/Vision-Flan.",
    "Visual Hallucinations of Multi-modal Large Language Models": "Visual hallucination (VH) means that a multi-modal LLM (MLLM) imagines incorrect details about an image in visual question answering. Existing studies find VH instances only in existing image datasets, which results in biased understanding of MLLMs' performance under VH due to limited diversity of such VH instances. In this work, we propose a tool called VHTest to generate a diverse set of VH instances. Specifically, VHTest finds some initial VH instances in existing image datasets (e.g., COCO), generates a text description for each VH mode, and uses a text-to-image generative model (e.g., DALL·E-3) to generate VH images based on the text descriptions. We collect a benchmark dataset with 1,200 VH instances in 8 VH modes using VHTest. We find that existing MLLMs such as GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, and MiniGPT-v2 hallucinate for a large fraction of the instances in our benchmark. Moreover, we find that fine-tuning an MLLM using our benchmark dataset reduces its likelihood to hallucinate without sacrificing its performance on other benchmarks. Our benchmarks are publicly available: https://github.com/wenhuang2000/VHTest.",
    "Visualization Recommendation with Prompt-based Reprogramming of Large Language Models": "Visualization recommendations, which aim to automatically match proper visual charts for specific data tables, can significantly simplify the data analysis process. Traditional approaches in this domain have primarily relied on rule-based or machine learning-based methodologies. These methods often demand extensive manual maintenance and yet fail to fully comprehend the tabular data, leading to unsatisfactory performance. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools, exhibiting strong reasoning capabilities. This advancement suggests their substantial promise in addressing visualization recommendation challenges. However, effectively harnessing LLMs to discern and rationalize patterns in tabular data, and consequently deduce the essential information for chart generation, remains an unresolved challenge. To this end, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Table Prompt-based reprogramming framework, named HTP. This framework aims to integrate multi-dimensional tabular data into LLMs through a strategically crafted prompt learning method while keeping the LLMs' backbone and weights unaltered. The HTP framework uniquely incorporates a four-level prompt structure, encompassing general, instance, cluster, and column levels. This multi-level approach is engineered to provide a comprehensive understanding of both general distribution and multifaceted fine-grained features of tabular data, before inputting the tabular data into the frozen LLM. Our empirical studies confirm that the HTP framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, marking an advancement in the field of data visualization and analysis.",
    "Visualizing Dialogues: Enhancing Image Selection through Dialogue Understanding with Large Language Models": "Recent advancements in dialogue systems have highlighted the significance of integrating multimodal responses, which enable conveying ideas through diverse modalities rather than solely relying on text-based interactions. This enrichment not only improves overall communicative efficacy but also enhances the quality of conversational experiences. However, existing methods for dialogue-to-image retrieval face limitations due to the constraints of pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) in comprehending complex dialogues accurately. To address this, we present a novel approach leveraging the robust reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate precise dialogue-associated visual descriptors, facilitating seamless connection with images. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark data validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in deriving concise and accurate visual descriptors, leading to significant enhancements in dialogue-to-image retrieval performance. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the method's generalizability across diverse visual cues, various LLMs, and different datasets, underscoring its practicality and potential impact in real-world applications.",
    "VisualWebArena: Evaluating Multimodal Agents on Realistic Visually Grounded Web Tasks": "Autonomous agents capable of planning, reasoning, and executing actions on the web offer a promising avenue for automating computer tasks. However, the majority of existing benchmarks primarily focus on text-based agents, neglecting many natural tasks that require visual information to effectively solve. Given that most computer interfaces cater to human perception, visual information often augments textual data in ways that text-only models struggle to harness effectively. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisualWebArena, a benchmark designed to assess the performance of multimodal agents on realistic visually grounded web tasks. VisualWebArena comprises of diverse and complex web-based tasks that evaluate various capabilities of autonomous multimodal agents. To perform well, agents need to accurately process image-text inputs, interpret natural language instructions, and execute actions on websites to accomplish user-defined objectives. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLM-based autonomous agents, including several multimodal agents. Our analysis reveals several limitations of text-based LLM agents, gaps in the capabilities of state-of-the-art multimodal language agents, and insights towards building stronger autonomous agents for the web.",
    "VulLibGen: Generating Names of Vulnerability-Affected Packages via a Large Language Model": "Security practitioners maintain vulnerability reports (e.g., GitHub Advisory) to help developers mitigate security risks. An important task for these databases is automatically extracting structured information mentioned in the report, e.g., the affected software packages, to accelerate the defense of the vulnerability ecosystem. However, it is challenging for existing work on affected package identification to achieve high precision. One reason is that all existing work focuses on relatively smaller models, thus they cannot harness the knowledge and semantic capabilities of large language models.  To address this limitation, we propose VulLibGen, the first method to use LLM for affected package identification. In contrast to existing work, VulLibGen proposes the novel idea to directly generate the affected package. To improve the precision, VulLibGen employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and a local search algorithm. The local search algorithm is a novel post-processing algorithm we introduce for reducing the hallucination of the generated packages.  Our evaluation results show that VulLibGen has an average precision of 0.806 for identifying vulnerable packages in the four most popular ecosystems in GitHub Advisory (Java, JS, Python, Go) while the best average precision in previous work is 0.721. Additionally, VulLibGen has high value to security practice: we submitted 60 <vulnerability, affected package> pairs to GitHub Advisory (covers four ecosystems) and 34 of them have been accepted and merged.",
    "WaterBench: Towards Holistic Evaluation of Watermarks for Large Language Models": "To mitigate the potential misuse of large language models (LLMs), recent research has developed watermarking algorithms, which restrict the generation process to leave an invisible trace for watermark detection. Due to the two-stage nature of the task, most studies evaluate the generation and detection separately, thereby presenting a challenge in unbiased, thorough, and applicable evaluations. In this paper, we introduce WaterBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for LLM watermarks, in which we design three crucial factors: (1) For benchmarking procedure, to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison, we first adjust each watermarking method's hyper-parameter to reach the same watermarking strength, then jointly evaluate their generation and detection performance. (2) For task selection, we diversify the input and output length to form a five-category taxonomy, covering 9 tasks. (3) For evaluation metric, we adopt the GPT4-Judge for automatically evaluating the decline of instruction-following abilities after watermarking. We evaluate 4 open-source watermarks on 2 LLMs under 2 watermarking strengths and observe the common struggles for current methods on maintaining the generation quality. The code and data are available at https://github.com/THU-KEG/WaterBench.",
    "WatME: Towards Lossless Watermarking Through Lexical Redundancy": "Text watermarking has emerged as a pivotal technique for identifying machine-generated text. However, existing methods often rely on arbitrary vocabulary partitioning during decoding to embed watermarks, which compromises the availability of suitable tokens and significantly degrades the quality of responses. This study assesses the impact of watermarking on different capabilities of large language models (LLMs) from a cognitive science lens. Our finding highlights a significant disparity; knowledge recall and logical reasoning are more adversely affected than language generation. These results suggest a more profound effect of watermarking on LLMs than previously understood. To address these challenges, we introduce Watermarking with Mutual Exclusion (WatME), a novel approach leveraging linguistic prior knowledge of inherent lexical redundancy in LLM vocabularies to seamlessly integrate watermarks. Specifically, WatME dynamically optimizes token usage during the decoding process by applying a mutually exclusive rule to the identified lexical redundancies. This strategy effectively prevents the unavailability of appropriate tokens and preserves the expressive power of LLMs. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence showing that WatME effectively preserves the diverse capabilities of LLMs while ensuring watermark detectability. Our code will be released to facilitate future research.",
    "WaveCoder: Widespread And Versatile Enhancement For Code Large Language Models By Instruction Tuning": "Recent work demonstrates that, after instruction tuning, Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) can obtain impressive capabilities to address a wide range of code-related tasks. However, current instruction tuning methods for Code LLMs mainly focus on the traditional code generation task, resulting in poor performance in complex multi-task scenarios. In this paper, we concentrate on multiple code-related tasks and present WaveCoder, a series of Code LLMs trained with Widespread And Versatile Enhanced instruction data. To enable the models to tackle complex code-related tasks, we propose a method to stably generate diverse, high-quality instruction data from open source code dataset in multi-task scenarios and obtain CodeSeaXDataset, a dataset comprising 19,915 instruction instances across 4 code-related tasks, which is aimed at improving the generalization ability of Code LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that WaveCoder models significantly outperform other open-source models in terms of the generalization ability across different code-related tasks. Moreover, WaveCoder-Ultra-6.7B presents the state-of-the-art generalization abilities on a wide range of code-related tasks.",
    "We Don't Talk About That: Case Studies on Intersectional Analysis of Social Bias in Large Language Models": "Despite concerns that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vectors for reproducing and amplifying social biases such as sexism, transphobia, islamophobia, and racism, there is a lack of work qualitatively analyzing how such patterns of bias are generated by LLMs. We use mixed-methods approaches and apply a feminist, intersectional lens to the problem across two language domains, Swedish and English, by generating narrative texts using LLMs. We find that hegemonic norms are consistently reproduced; dominant identities are often treated as 'default'; and discussion of identity itself may be considered 'inappropriate' by the safety features applied to some LLMs. Due to the differing behaviors of models, depending both on their design and the language they are trained on, we observe that strategies of identifying “bias” must be adapted to individual models and their socio-cultural contexts.",
    "WebCiteS: Attributed Query-Focused Summarization on Chinese Web Search Results with Citations": "Enhancing the attribution in large language models (LLMs) is a crucial task. One feasible approach is to enable LLMs to cite external sources that support their generations. However, existing datasets and evaluation methods in this domain still exhibit notable limitations. In this work, we formulate the task of attributed query-focused summarization (AQFS) and present WebCiteS, a Chinese dataset featuring 7k human-annotated summaries with citations. WebCiteS derives from real-world user queries and web search results, offering a valuable resource for model training and evaluation. Prior works in attribution evaluation do not differentiate between groundedness errors and citation errors. They also fall short in automatically verifying sentences that draw partial support from multiple sources. We tackle these issues by developing detailed metrics and enabling the automatic evaluator to decompose the sentences into sub-claims for fine-grained verification. Our comprehensive evaluation of both open-source and proprietary models on WebCiteS highlights the challenge LLMs face in correctly citing sources, underscoring the necessity for further improvement.",
    "WebVoyager: Building an End-to-End Web Agent with Large Multimodal Models": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to a new era marked by the development of autonomous applications in real-world scenarios, which drives innovation in creating advanced web agents. Existing web agents typically only handle one input modality and are evaluated only in simplified web simulators or static web snapshots, greatly limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce WebVoyager, an innovative Large Multimodal Model (LMM) powered web agent that can complete user instructions end-to-end by interacting with real-world websites. Moreover, we establish a new benchmark by compiling real-world tasks from 15 popular websites and introduce an automatic evaluation protocol leveraging multi-modal understanding abilities of GPT-4V to evaluate open-ended web agents. We show that WebVoyager achieves a 59.1% task success rate on our benchmark, significantly surpassing the performance of both GPT-4 (All Tools) and the WebVoyager (text-only) setups, underscoring the exceptional capability of WebVoyager. The proposed automatic evaluation metric achieves 85.3% agreement with human judgment, indicating its effectiveness in providing reliable and accurate assessments of web agents.",
    "What Do Language Models Hear? Probing for Auditory Representations in Language Models": "This work explores whether language models encode meaningfully grounded representations of sounds of objects. We learn a linear probe that retrieves the correct text representation of an object given a snippet of audio related to that object, where the sound representation is given by a pretrained audio model. This probe is trained via a contrastive loss that pushes the language representations and sound representations of an object to be close to one another. After training, the probe is tested on its ability to generalize to objects that were not seen during training. Across different language models and audio models, we find that the probe generalization is above chance in many cases, indicating that despite being trained only on raw text, language models encode grounded knowledge of sounds for some objects.",
    "What Do Language Models Learn in Context? The Structured Task Hypothesis.": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit an intriguing ability to learn a novel task from in-context examples presented in a demonstration, termed in-context learning (ICL). Understandably, a swath of research has been dedicated to uncovering the theories underpinning ICL. One popular hypothesis explains ICL by task selection. LLMs identify the task based on the demonstration and generalize it to the prompt. Another popular hypothesis is that ICL is a form of meta-learning, i.e., the models learn a learning algorithm at pre-training time and apply it to the demonstration. Finally, a third hypothesis argues that LLMs use the demonstration to select a composition of tasks learned during pre-training to perform ICL. In this paper, we empirically explore these three hypotheses that explain LLMs' ability to learn in context with a suite of experiments derived from common text classification tasks. We invalidate the first two hypotheses with counterexamples and provide evidence in support of the last hypothesis. Our results suggest an LLM could learn a novel task in context via composing tasks learned during pre-training.",
    "What does Parameter-free Probing Really Uncover?": "Supervised approaches to probing large language models (LLMs) have been criticized of using pre-defined theory-laden target labels. As an alternative, parameter-free probing constructs structural representations bottom-up via information derived from the LLM alone. This has been suggested to capture a genuine “LLM-internal grammar”. However, its relation to familiar linguistic formalisms remains unclear. I extend prior work on a parameter-free probing technique called perturbed masking applied to BERT, by comparing its results to the Universal Dependencies (UD) formalism for English. The results highlight several major discrepancies between BERT and UD, which lack correlates in linguistic theory. This raises the question of whether human grammar is the correct analogy to interpret BERT in the first place.",
    "What Does the Bot Say? Opportunities and Risks of Large Language Models in Social Media Bot Detection": "Social media bot detection has always been an arms race between advancements in machine learning bot detectors and adversarial bot strategies to evade detection. In this work, we bring the arms race to the next level by investigating the opportunities and risks of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in social bot detection. To investigate the opportunities, we design novel LLM-based bot detectors by proposing a mixture-of-heterogeneous-experts framework to divide and conquer diverse user information modalities. To illuminate the risks, we explore the possibility of LLM-guided manipulation of user textual and structured information to evade detection. Extensive experiments with three LLMs on two datasets demonstrate that instruction tuning on merely 1,000 annotated examples produces specialized LLMs that outperform state-of-the-art bot detection baselines by up to 9.1% on both datasets. On the other hand, LLM-guided manipulation strategies could significantly bring down the performance of existing bot detectors by up to 29.6% and harm the calibration and reliability of bot detection systems. Ultimately, this work identifies LLMs as the new frontier of social bot detection research.",
    "What Evidence Do Language Models Find Convincing?": "Retrieval-augmented language models are being increasingly tasked with subjective, contentious, and conflicting queries such as “is aspartame linked to cancer”. To resolve these ambiguous queries, one must search through a large range of websites and consider which, if any, of this evidence do I find convincing? In this work, we study how LLMs answer this question. In particular, we construct CONFLICTINGQA, a dataset that pairs controversial queries with a series of real-world evidence documents that contain different facts (e.g., quantitative results), argument styles (e.g., appeals to authority), and answers (Yes or No). We use this dataset to perform sensitivity and counterfactual analyses to explore which text features most affect LLM predictions. Overall, we find that current models rely heavily on the relevance of a website to the query, while largely ignoring stylistic features that humans find important such as whether a text contains scientific references or is written with a neutral tone. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of RAG corpus quality (e.g., the need to filter misinformation), and possibly even a shift in how LLMs are trained to better align with human judgements.",
    "What is the Best Way for ChatGPT to Translate Poetry?": "Machine translation (MT) has historically faced significant challenges when applied to literary works, particularly in the domain of poetry translation. The advent of Large Language Models such as ChatGPT holds potential for innovation in this field. This study examines ChatGPT's capabilities in English-Chinese poetry translation tasks, utilizing targeted prompts and small sample scenarios to ascertain optimal performance. Despite promising outcomes, our analysis reveals persistent issues in the translations generated by ChatGPT that warrant attention. To address these shortcomings, we propose an Explanation-Assisted Poetry Machine Translation (EAPMT) method, which leverages monolingual poetry explanation as a guiding information for the translation process. Furthermore, we refine existing evaluation criteria to better suit the nuances of modern poetry translation. We engaged a panel of professional poets for assessments, complemented evaluations by using GPT-4. The results from both human and machine evaluations demonstrate that our EAPMT method outperforms traditional translation methods of ChatGPT and the existing online systems. This paper validates the efficacy of our method and contributes a novel perspective to machine-assisted literary translation.",
    "What Makes a Good Order of Examples in In-Context Learning": "Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive few-shot learning capabilities via in-context learning (ICL), ICL performance is known to be highly sensitive to the order of examples provided. To identify appropriate orders, recent studies propose heuristic methods to evaluate order performance using a set of unlabeled data. However, the requirement of in-domain data limits their utility in real-world scenarios where additional annotated data is challenging to acquire. Additionally, these dataset-based approaches are prone to being sub-optimal for a lack of consideration for individual differences. To address the problems, we first analyze the properties of performant example orders at both corpus level and instance level. Based on the analysis we propose DEmO to adaptively identify performant example order for each instance without extra data. DEmO works by filtering out a subset of orders featuring label fairness, then selecting the most influential order for each test instance. The employment of a content-free metric makes DEmO independent of in-domain data. Extensive experiments indicate the superiority of DEmO over a wide range of strong baselines. Further analysis validates the generalizability across various settings.",
    "When Benchmarks are Targets: Revealing the Sensitivity of Large Language Model Leaderboards": "Large Language Model (LLM) leaderboards based on benchmark rankings are regularly used to guide practitioners in model selection. Often, the published leaderboard rankings are taken at face value — we show this is a (potentially costly) mistake. Under existing leaderboards, the relative performance of LLMs is highly sensitive to (often minute) details. We show that for popular multiple-choice question benchmarks (e.g., MMLU), minor perturbations to the benchmark, such as changing the order of choices or the method of answer selection, result in changes in rankings up to 8 positions. We explain this phenomenon by conducting systematic experiments over three broad categories of benchmark perturbations and identifying the sources of this behavior. Our analysis results in several best-practice recommendations, including the advantage of a hybrid scoring method for answer selection. Our study highlights the dangers of relying on simple benchmark evaluations and charts the path for more robust evaluation schemes on the existing benchmarks.",
    "When Do LLMs Need Retrieval Augmentation?": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been found to have difficulty knowing they do not possess certain knowledge and tend to provide specious answers in such cases. Retrieval Augmentation (RA) has been extensively studied to mitigate LLMs' hallucinations. However, due to the extra overhead and unassured quality of retrieval, it may not be optimal to conduct RA all the time. A straightforward idea is to only conduct retrieval when LLMs are uncertain about a question. This motivates us to enhance the LLMs' ability to perceive their knowledge boundaries to help RA. In this paper, we first quantitatively measure LLMs' such ability and confirm their overconfidence. Then, we study how LLMs' certainty about a question correlates with their dependence on external retrieved information. We propose several methods to enhance LLMs' perception of knowledge boundaries and show that they are effective in reducing overconfidence. Additionally, equipped with these methods, LLMs can achieve comparable or even better performance of RA with much fewer retrieval calls. The code can be found at https://github.com/ShiyuNee/When-to-Retrieve.",
    "When is Tree Search Useful for LLM Planning?": "In this paper, we examine how large language models (LLMs) solve multi-step problems under a language agent framework with three components: a generator, a discriminator, and a planning method. We investigate the practical utility of two advanced planning methods, iterative correction and tree search. We present a comprehensive analysis of how discrimination accuracy affects the overall performance of agents when using these two methods or a simpler method, re-ranking. Experiments on two tasks, text-to-SQL parsing and mathematical reasoning, show that: (1) advanced planning methods demand discriminators with at least 90% accuracy to achieve significant improvements over re-ranking; (2) current LLMs' discrimination abilities have not met the needs of advanced planning methods to achieve such improvements; (3) with LLM-based discriminators, advanced planning methods may not adequately balance accuracy and efficiency. For example, compared to the other two methods, tree search is at least 10-20 times slower but leads to negligible performance gains, which hinders its real-world applications.",
    "When Phrases Meet Probabilities: Enabling Open Relation Extraction with Cooperating Large Language Models": "Current clustering-based open relation extraction (OpenRE) methods usually apply clustering algorithms on top of pre-trained language models. However, this practice has three drawbacks. First, embeddings from language models are high-dimensional and anisotropic, so using simple metrics to calculate distances between these embeddings may not accurately reflect the relational similarity. Second, there exists a gap between the pre-trained language models and downstream clustering for their different objective forms. Third, clustering with embeddings deviates from the primary aim of relation extraction, as it does not directly obtain relations. In this work, we propose a new idea for OpenRE in the era of LLMs, that is, extracting relational phrases and directly exploiting the knowledge in LLMs to assess the semantic similarity between phrases without relying on any additional metrics. Based on this idea, we developed a framework, ORELLM, that makes two LLMs work collaboratively to achieve clustering and address the above issues. Experimental results on different datasets show that ORELLM outperforms current baselines by 1.4% ∼3.13% in terms of clustering accuracy.",
    "When to Trust LLMs: Aligning Confidence with Response Quality": "Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language generation, much evidence shows that LLMs may produce incorrect or nonsensical text. This limitation highlights the importance of discerning when to trust LLMs, especially in safety-critical domains. Existing methods often express reliability by confidence level, however, their effectiveness is limited by the lack of objective guidance. To address this, we propose CONfidence-Quality-ORDer-preserving alignment approach (CONQORD), which leverages reinforcement learning guided by a tailored dual-component reward function. This function integrates quality reward and order-preserving alignment reward functions. Specifically, the order-preserving reward incentivizes the model to verbalize greater confidence for responses of higher quality to align the order of confidence and quality. Experiments demonstrate that CONQORD significantly improves the alignment performance between confidence and response accuracy, without causing over-cautious. Furthermore, the aligned confidence provided by CONQORD informs when to trust LLMs, and acts as a determinant for initiating the retrieval process of external knowledge. Aligning confidence with response quality ensures more transparent and reliable responses, providing better trustworthiness.",
    "Which Side Are You On? A Multi-task Dataset for End-to-End Argument Summarisation and Evaluation": "With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs), it is no longer infeasible to build an automated debate system that helps people to synthesise persuasive arguments. Previous work attempted this task by integrating multiple components. In our work, we introduce an argument mining dataset that captures the end-to-end process of preparing an argumentative essay for a debate, which covers the tasks of claim and evidence identification (Task 1 ED), evidence convincingness ranking (Task 2 ECR), argumentative essay summarisation and human preference ranking (Task 3 ASR) and metric learning for automated evaluation of resulting essays, based on human feedback along argument quality dimensions (Task 4 SQE). Our dataset contains 14k examples of claims that are fully annotated with the various properties supporting the aforementioned tasks. We evaluate multiple generative baselines for each of these tasks, including representative LLMs. We find, that while they show promising results on individual tasks in our benchmark, their end-to-end performance on all four tasks in succession deteriorates significantly, both in automated measures as well as in human-centred evaluation. This challenge presented by our proposed dataset motivates future research on end-to-end argument mining and summarisation. The repository of this project is available at https://github.com/HarrywillDr/ArgSum-Datatset",
    "Whitening Not Recommended for Classification Tasks in LLMs": "Sentence embedding is a cornerstone in NLP. Whitening has been claimed to be an effective operation to improve embedding quality obtained from Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we find that the efficacy of whitening is model-dependent and task-dependent. In particular, whitening degenerates embeddings for classification tasks. The conclusion is supported by extensive experiments. A by-product of our research is embedding evaluation platform for LLMs called SentEval+.",
    "Who Wrote this Code? Watermarking for Code Generation": "Since the remarkable generation performance of large language models raised ethical and legal concerns, approaches to detect machine-generated text by embedding watermarks are being developed. However, we discover that the existing works fail to function appropriately in code generation tasks due to the task's nature of having low entropy. Extending a logit-modifying watermark method, we propose Selective WatErmarking via Entropy Thresholding (SWEET), which enhances detection ability and mitigates code quality degeneration by removing low-entropy segments at generating and detecting watermarks. Our experiments show that SWEET significantly improves code quality preservation while outperforming all baselines, including post-hoc detection methods, in detecting machine-generated code text. Our code is available in https://github.com/hongcheki/sweet-watermark.",
    "Whose Emotions and Moral Sentiments Do Language Models Reflect?": "Language models (LMs) are known to represent the perspectives of some social groups better than others, which may impact their performance, especially on subjective tasks such as content moderation and hate speech detection. To explore how LMs represent different perspectives, existing research focused on positional alignment, i.e., how closely the models mimic the opinions and stances of different groups, e.g., liberals or conservatives. However, human communication also encompasses emotional and moral dimensions. We define the problem of affective alignment, which measures how LMs' emotional and moral tone represents those of different groups. By comparing the affect of responses generated by 36 LMs to the affect of Twitter messages written by two ideological groups, we observe significant misalignment of LMs with both ideological groups. This misalignment is larger than the partisan divide in the U.S. Even after steering the LMs towards specific ideological perspectives, the misalignment and liberal tendencies of the model persist, suggesting a systemic bias within LMs.",
    "Why Don't Prompt-Based Fairness Metrics Correlate?": "The widespread use of large language models has brought up essential questions about the potential biases these models might learn. This led to the development of several metrics aimed at evaluating and mitigating these biases. In this paper, we first demonstrate that prompt-based fairness metrics exhibit poor agreement, as measured by correlation, raising important questions about the reliability of fairness assessment using prompts. Then, we outline six relevant reasons why such a low correlation is observed across existing metrics. Based on these insights, we propose a method called Correlated Fairness Output (CAIRO) to enhance the correlation between fairness metrics. CAIRO augments the original prompts of a given fairness metric by using several pre-trained language models and then selects the combination of the augmented prompts that achieves the highest correlation across metrics. We show a significant improvement in Pearson correlation from 0.3 and 0.18 to 0.90 and 0.98 across metrics for gender and religion biases, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/chandar-lab/CAIRO.",
    "Why LLM-Generated Texts Fail to Improve Text Classification Models": "In this paper, we present our approach to addressing the binary classification tasks, Tasks 5 and 6, as part of the Social Media Mining for Health (SMM4H) text classification challenge. Both tasks involved working with imbalanced datasets that featured a scarcity of positive examples. To mitigate this imbalance, we employed a Large Language Model to generate synthetic texts with positive labels, aiming to augment the training data for our text classification models. Unfortunately, this method did not significantly improve model performance. Through clustering analysis using text embeddings, we discovered that the generated texts significantly lacked diversity compared to the raw data. This finding highlights the challenges of using synthetic text generation for enhancing model efficacy in real-world applications, specifically in the context of health-related social media data.",
    "WilKE: Wise-Layer Knowledge Editor for Lifelong Knowledge Editing": "Knowledge editing aims to rectify inaccuracies in large language models (LLMs) without costly retraining for outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, current knowledge editing methods primarily focus on single editing, failing to meet the requirements for lifelong editing. This study reveals a performance degradation encountered by knowledge editing in lifelong editing, characterized by toxicity buildup and toxicity flash, with the primary cause identified as pattern unmatch. We introduce a knowledge editing approach named Wise-Layer Knowledge Editor (WilKE), which selects editing layer based on the pattern matching degree of editing knowledge across different layers in language models. Experimental results demonstrate that, in lifelong editing, WilKE exhibits an average improvement of 46.2% and 67.8% on editing GPT2-XL and GPT-J relative to state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods.",
    "WisPerMed at BioLaySumm: Adapting Autoregressive Large Language Models for Lay Summarization of Scientific Articles": "This paper details the efforts of the WisPerMed team in the BioLaySumm2024 Shared Task on automatic lay summarization in the biomedical domain, aimed at making scientific publications accessible to non-specialists. Large language models (LLMs), specifically the BioMistral and Llama3 models, were fine-tuned and employed to create lay summaries from complex scientific texts. The summarization performance was enhanced through various approaches, including instruction tuning, few-shot learning, and prompt variations tailored to incorporate specific context information. The experiments demonstrated that fine-tuning generally led to the best performance across most evaluated metrics. Few-shot learning notably improved the models' ability to generate relevant and factually accurate texts, particularly when using a well-crafted prompt. Additionally, a Dynamic Expert Selection (DES) mechanism to optimize the selection of text outputs based on readability and factuality metrics was developed. Out of 54 participants, the WisPerMed team reached the 4th place, measured by readability, factuality, and relevance. Determined by the overall score, our approach improved upon the baseline by ≈5.5 percentage points and was only ≈1.5 percentage points behind the first place.",
    "WisPerMed at “Discharge Me!”: Advancing Text Generation in Healthcare with Large Language Models, Dynamic Expert Selection, and Priming Techniques on MIMIC-IV": "This study aims to leverage state of the art language models to automate generating the “Brief Hospital Course” and “Discharge Instructions” sections of Discharge Summaries from the MIMIC-IV dataset, reducing clinicians' administrative workload. We investigate how automation can improve documentation accuracy, alleviate clinician burnout, and enhance operational efficacy in healthcare facilities. This research was conducted within our participation in the Shared Task Discharge Me! at BioNLP @ ACL 2024. Various strategies were employed, including Few-Shot learning, instruction tuning, and Dynamic Expert Selection (DES), to develop models capable of generating the required text sections. Utilizing an additional clinical domain-specific dataset demonstrated substantial potential to enhance clinical language processing. The DES method, which optimizes the selection of text outputs from multiple predictions, proved to be especially effective. It achieved the highest overall score of 0.332 in the competition, surpassing single-model outputs. This finding suggests that advanced deep learning methods in combination with DES can effectively automate parts of electronic health record documentation. These advancements could enhance patient care by freeing clinician time for patient interactions. The integration of text selection strategies represents a promising avenue for further research.",
    "Word Embeddings Are Steers for Language Models": "Language models (LMs) automatically learn word embeddings during pre-training on language corpora. Although word embeddings are usually interpreted as feature vectors for individual words, their roles in language model generation remain underexplored. In this work, we theoretically and empirically revisit output word embeddings and find that their linear transformations are equivalent to steering language model generation styles. We name such steers LM-Steers and find them existing in LMs of all sizes. It requires learning parameters equal to 0.2% of the original LMs' size for steering each style. On tasks such as language model detoxification and sentiment control, LM-Steers can achieve comparable or superior performance compared with state-of-the-art controlled generation methods while maintaining a better balance with generation quality. The learned LM-Steer serves as a lens in text styles: it reveals that word embeddings are interpretable when associated with language model generations and can highlight text spans that most indicate the style differences. An LM-Steer is transferrable between different language models by an explicit-form calculation. One can also continuously steer LMs simply by scaling the LM-Steer or compose multiple LM-Steers by adding their transformations.",
    "Word Matters: What Influences Domain Adaptation in Summarization?": "Domain adaptation aims to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to generalize domain datasets unseen effectively during the training phase. However, factors such as the size of the model parameters and the scale of training data are general influencers and do not reflect the nuances of domain adaptation performance. This paper investigates the fine-grained factors affecting domain adaptation performance, analyzing the specific impact of 'words' in training data on summarization tasks. We propose quantifying dataset learning difficulty as the learning difficulty of generative summarization, which is determined by two indicators: word-based compression rate and abstraction level. Our experiments conclude that, when considering dataset learning difficulty, the cross-domain overlap and the performance gain in summarization tasks exhibit an approximate linear relationship, which is not directly related to the number of words. Based on this finding, predicting a model's performance on unknown domain datasets is possible without undergoing training. Source code and scripts are available at https://github.com/li-aolong/Word-Matters.",
    "WORDFLOW: Social Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models": "Large language models (LLMs) require well-crafted prompts for effective use. Prompt engineering, the process of designing prompts, is challenging, particularly for non-experts who are less familiar with AI technologies. While researchers have proposed techniques and tools to assist LLM users in prompt design, these works primarily target AI application developers rather than non-experts. To address this research gap, we propose social prompt engineering, a novel paradigm that leverages social computing techniques to facilitate collaborative prompt design. To investigate social prompt engineering, we introduce WORDFLOW, an open-source and social text editor that enables everyday users to easily create, run, share, and discover LLM prompts. Additionally, by leveraging modern web technologies, WORDFLOW allows users to run LLMs locally and privately in their browsers. Two usage scenarios highlight how our tool's incorporation of social prompt engineering can enhance laypeople's interactions with LLMs. WORDFLOW is publicly accessible at https://poloclub.github.io/wordflow.",
    "WRP: Weight Recover Prune for Structured Sparsity": "As the scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) increases, it is necessary to compress the models to reduce the substantial demand on computational resources. Network pruning significantly reduces the model size by converting the weight matrix from dense to sparse data format. Current methodologies advocate for one-shot pruning to avoid the expense of retraining, ensuring the maintenance of model performance under conditions of 50%-60% unstructured pruning. Nevertheless, matrices characterized by this level of sparsity could not be treated as sparse matrices, because the indices would incur significant costs. To mitigate this problem, NVIDIA introduced the 2:4 structured sparsity. However, we observe a notable decline in model performance when adopting 2:4 structured sparsity due to group constraints. In this paper, we introduce the Weight Recover Prune (WRP) approach. By recovering a minimal set of critical weights, WRP aims to enhance model performance while maintaining the efficiency of the compression. Our evaluation of the WRP method on the LLAMA2 and OPT models shows that it outperforms other 2:4 pattern one-shot pruning methods. Meanwhile, WRP can guarantee that the size of the pruned model is about 60% of the dense model.",
    "WU_TLAXE at WASSA 2024 Explainability for Cross-Lingual Emotion in Tweets Shared Task 1: Emotion through Translation using TwHIN-BERT and GPT": "This paper describes our task 1 submission for the WASSA 2024 shared task on Explainability for Cross-lingual Emotion in Tweets. Our task is to predict the correct emotion label (Anger, Sadness, Fear, Joy, Love, and Neutral) for a dataset of English, Dutch, French, Spanish, and Russian tweets, while training exclusively on English emotion labeled data, to reveal what kind of emotion detection information is transferable cross-language (Maladry et al., 2024). To that end, we used an ensemble of models with a GPT-4 decider. Our ensemble consisted of a few-shot GPT-4 prompt system and a TwHIN-BERT system fine-tuned on the EXALT and additional English data. We ranked 8th place under the name WU_TLAXE with an F1 Macro score of 0.573 on the test set. We also experimented with an English-only TwHIN-BERT model by translating the other languages into English for inference, which proved to be worse than the other models.",
    "X-Instruction: Aligning Language Model in Low-resource Languages with Self-curated Cross-lingual Instructions": "Large language models respond well in high-resource languages like English but struggle in low-resource languages. It may arise from the lack of high-quality instruction following data in these languages. Directly translating English samples into these languages can be a solution but unreliable, leading to responses with translation errors and lacking language-specific or cultural knowledge. To address this issue, we propose a novel method to construct cross-lingual instruction following samples with instruction in English and response in low-resource languages. Specifically, the language model first learns to generate appropriate English instructions according to the natural web texts in other languages as responses. The candidate cross-lingual instruction tuning samples are further refined and diversified. We have employed this method to build a large-scale cross-lingual instruction tuning dataset on 10 languages, namely X-Instruction. The instruction data built using our method incorporate more language-specific knowledge compared with the naive translation method. Experimental results have shown that the response quality of the model tuned on X-Instruction greatly exceeds the model distilled from a powerful teacher model, reaching or even surpassing the ones of ChatGPT. In addition, we find that models tuned on cross-lingual instruction following samples can follow the instruction in the output language without further tuning.",
    "X-Shot: A Unified System to Handle Frequent, Few-shot and Zero-shot Learning Simultaneously in Classification": "In recent years, few-shot and zero-shot learning, which learn to predict labels with limited annotated instances, have garnered significant attention. Traditional approaches often treat frequent-shot (freq-shot; labels with abundant instances), few-shot, and zero-shot learning as distinct challenges, optimizing systems for just one of these scenarios. Yet, in real-world settings, label occurrences vary greatly. Some of them might appear thousands of times, while others might only appear sporadically or not at all. For practical deployment, it is crucial that a system can adapt to any label occurrence. We introduce a novel classification challenge: X-Shot, reflecting a real-world context where freq-shot, few-shot, and zero-shot labels co-occur without predefined limits. Here, X can span from 0 to +∞. The crux of X-Shot centers on open-domain generalization and devising a system versatile enough to manage various label scenarios. To solve X-Shot, we propose BinBin (binary inference based on instruction following) that leverages the Indirect Supervision from a large collection of NLP tasks via instruction following, bolstered by Weak Supervision provided by large language models. BinBin surpasses previous state-of-the-art techniques on three benchmark datasets across multiple domains. To our knowledge, this is the first work addressing X-Shot learning, where X remains variable.",
    "XCODEEVAL: An Execution-based Large Scale Multilingual Multitask Benchmark for Code Understanding, Generation, Translation and Retrieval": "Recently, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in generating codes from natural language descriptions, repairing buggy codes, translating codes between languages, and retrieving relevant code segments. However, the evaluation of these models has often been performed in a scattered way on only one or two specific tasks, in a few languages, at a partial granularity (e.g., function) level, and in many cases without proper training data. Even more concerning is that in most cases the evaluation of generated codes has been done in terms of mere lexical overlap with a reference code rather than actual execution. We introduce XCODEEVAL, the largest executable multilingual multitask benchmark to date consisting of 25M document-level coding examples (16.5B tokens) from about 7.5K unique problems covering up to 11 programming languages with execution-level parallelism. It features a total of 7 tasks involving code understanding, generation, translation and retrieval. XCODEEVAL adopts an execution-based evaluation and offers a multilingual code execution engine, ExecEval that supports unit test based execution in all the 11 languages. To address the challenge of balancing the distributions of text-code samples over multiple attributes in validation/test sets, we propose a novel data splitting and a data selection schema based on the geometric mean and graph-theoretic principle. Our experiments with OpenAI's LLMs (zero-shot) and open-LLMs (zero-shot and fine-tuned) on the tasks and languages demonstrate XCODEEVAL to be quite challenging as per the current advancements in language models.",
    "XFACT Team0331 at PerspectiveArg2024: Sampling from Bounded Clusters for Diverse Relevant Argument Retrieval": "This paper reports on the argument mining system submitted to the ArgMining workshop 2024 for The Perspective Argument Retrieval Shared Task (Falk et al., 2024). We combine the strengths of a smaller Sentence BERT model and a Large Language Model: the former is fine-tuned for a contrastive embedding objective and a classification objective whereas the latter is invoked to augment the query and populate the latent space with diverse relevant arguments. We conduct an ablation study on these components to find that each contributes substantially to the diversity and relevance criteria for the top-k retrieval of arguments from the given corpus.",
    "XFT: Unlocking the Power of Code Instruction Tuning by Simply Merging Upcycled Mixture-of-Experts": "We introduce XFT, a simple yet powerful training scheme, by simply merging upcycled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to unleash the performance limit of instruction-tuned code Large Language Models (LLMs). While vanilla sparse upcycling fails to improve instruction tuning, XFT introduces a shared expert mechanism with a novel routing weight normalization strategy into sparse upcycling, which significantly boosts instruction tuning. After fine-tuning the upcycled MoE model, XFT introduces a learnable model merging mechanism to compile the upcycled MoE model back to a dense model, achieving upcycled MoE-level performance with only dense-model compute. By applying XFT to a 1.3B model, we create a new state-of-the-art tiny code LLM (<3B) with 67.1 and 64.6 pass@1 on HumanEval and HumanEval+ respectively. With the same data and model architecture, XFT improves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by 13% on HumanEval+, along with consistent improvements from 2% to 13% on MBPP+, MultiPL-E, and DS-1000, demonstrating its generalizability. XFT is fully orthogonal to existing techniques such as Evol-Instruct and OSS-INSTRUCT, opening a new dimension for improving code instruction tuning.",
    "XMC-AGENT : Dynamic Navigation over Scalable Hierarchical Index for Incremental Extreme Multi-label Classification": "The eXtreme Multi-label Classification (XMC) aims to accurately assign a large number of labels to instances, presenting challenges in learning, managing, and predicting across a vast and rapidly growing set of labels. Traditional XMC methods, such as one-vs-all and tree-based methods struggle with the increasing set of labels due to their static label assumptions, while embedding-based methods face difficulties with complex mapping relationships due to their late-interaction paradigm. In this paper, we propose a large language model (LLM) powered agent framework for extreme multi-label classification - XMC-AGENT, which can effectively learn, manage and predict an extremely large and dynamically increasing set of labels. Specifically, XMC-AGENT models the extreme multi-label classification task as a dynamic navigation problem, employing a scalable hierarchical label index to effectively manage the unified label space. Additionally, we design two algorithms to enhance the dynamic navigation capabilities of XMC-AGENT: a self-construction algorithm for building the scalable hierarchical index, and an iterative feedback learning algorithm for adjusting the agent to specific tasks. Experiments demonstrate that XMC-AGENT achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three datasets.",
    "XNLP: An Interactive Demonstration System for Universal Structured NLP": "Structured Natural Language Processing (XNLP) is an important subset of NLP that entails understanding the underlying semantic or syntactic structure of texts, which serves as a foundational component for many downstream applications. Despite certain recent efforts to explore universal solutions for specific categories of XNLP tasks, a comprehensive and effective approach for unifying all XNLP tasks long remains underdeveloped. Meanwhile, while XNLP demonstration systems are vital for researchers exploring various XNLP tasks, existing platforms can be limited to, e.g., supporting few XNLP tasks, lacking interactivity and universalness. To this end, we propose an advanced XNLP demonstration system, where we leverage LLM to achieve universal XNLP, with one model for all with high generalizability. Overall, our system advances in multiple aspects, including universal XNLP modeling, high performance, interpretability, scalability, and interactivity, offering a unified platform for exploring diverse XNLP tasks in the community.",
    "XrayGPT: Chest Radiographs Summarization using Large Medical Vision-Language Models": "The latest breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have showcased promising capabilities toward performing a wide range of tasks. Such models are typically trained on massive datasets comprising billions of image-text pairs with diverse tasks. However, their performance on task-specific domains, such as radiology, is still under-explored. While few works have recently explored LLMs-based conversational medical models, they mainly focus on text-based analysis. In this paper, we introduce XrayGPT, a conversational medical vision-language (VLMs) model that can analyze and answer open-ended questions about chest radiographs. Specifically, we align both medical visual encoder with a fine-tuned LLM to possess visual conversation abilities, grounded in an understanding of radiographs and medical knowledge. For improved alignment of chest radiograph data, we generate 217k interactive and high-quality summaries from free-text radiology reports. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the merits of XrayGPT. To conduct an expert evaluation, certified medical doctors evaluated the output of our XrayGPT on a test subset and the results reveal that more than 70% of the responses are scientifically accurate, with an average score of 4/5.",
    "Yale at Discharge Me!: Evaluating Constrained Generation of Discharge Summaries with Unstructured and Structured Information": "In this work, we propose our top-ranking (2nd place) pipeline for the generation of discharge summary subsections as a part of the BioNLP 2024 Shared Task 2: Discharge Me!. We evaluate both encoder-decoder and state-of-the-art decoder-only language models on the generation of two key sections of the discharge summary. To evaluate the ability of NLP methods to further alleviate the documentation burden on physicians, we also design a novel pipeline to generate the brief hospital course directly from structured information found in the EHR. Finally, we evaluate a constrained beam search approach to inject external knowledge about relevant patient problems into the text generation process. We find that a BioBART model fine-tuned on a larger fraction of the data without constrained beam search outperforms all other models.",
    "YNU-HPCC at SIGHAN-2024 dimABSA Task: Using PLMs with a Joint Learning Strategy for Dimensional Intensity Prediction": "The dimensional approach can represent more fine-grained emotional information than discrete affective states. In this paper, a pre-trained language model (PLM) with a joint learning strategy is proposed for the SIGHAN-2024 shared task on Chinese dimensional aspect-based sentiment analysis (dimABSA), which requires submitted models to provide fine-grained multi-dimensional (Valence and Arousal) intensity predictions for given aspects of a review. The proposed model consists of three parts: an input layer that concatenates both given aspect terms and input sentences; a Chinese PLM encoder that generates aspect-specific review representation; and separate linear predictors that jointly predict Valence and Arousal sentiment intensities. Moreover, we merge simplified and traditional Chinese training data for data augmentation. Our system ranked 2nd place out of 5 participants in subtask 1-intensity prediction. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/WZH5127/2024_subtask1_intensity_prediction.",
    "You Only Look at Screens: Multimodal Chain-of-Action Agents": "Autonomous graphical user interface (GUI) agents aim to facilitate task automation by interacting with the user interface without manual intervention. Recent studies have investigated eliciting the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for effective engagement in diverse environments. To align with the input-output requirement of LLMs, most existing approaches are developed under a sandbox setting where they rely on external tools and application-specific APIs to parse the environment into textual elements and interpret the predicted actions. Consequently, those approaches often grapple with inference inefficiency and error propagation risks. To mitigate the challenges, we introduce Auto-GUI, a multimodal solution that directly interacts with the interface, bypassing the need for environment parsing or reliance on application-dependent APIs. Moreover, we propose a chain-of-action technique—leveraging a series of intermediate previous action histories and future action plans—to help the agent decide what action to execute. We evaluate our approach on a new device-control benchmark AITW with 30K unique instructions, spanning multi-step tasks such as application operation, web searching, and web shopping. Experimental results show that Auto-GUI achieves state-of-the-art performance with an action type prediction accuracy of 90% and an overall action success rate of 74%.",
    "Your Co-Workers Matter: Evaluating Collaborative Capabilities of Language Models in Blocks World": "Language agents that interact with the world on their own have great potential for automating digital tasks. While large language model (LLM) agents have made progress in understanding and executing tasks such as textual games and webpage control, many real-world tasks also require collaboration with humans or other LLMs in equal roles, which involves intent understanding, task coordination, and communication. To test LLM's ability to collaborate, we design a blocks-world environment, where two agents, each having unique goals and skills, build a target structure together. To complete the goals, they can act in the world and communicate in natural language. Under this environment, we design increasingly challenging settings to evaluate different collaboration perspectives, from independent to more complex, dependent tasks. We further adopt chain-of-thought prompts that include intermediate reasoning steps to model the partner's state and identify and correct execution errors. Both human-machine and machine-machine experiments show that LLM agents have strong grounding capacities, and our approach significantly improves the evaluation metric.",
    "Your Transformer is Secretly Linear": "This paper reveals a novel linear characteristic exclusive to transformer decoders, including models such as GPT, LLaMA, OPT, BLOOM and others. We analyze embedding transformations between sequential layers, uncovering a near-perfect linear relationship (Procrustes similarity score of 0.99). However, linearity decreases when the residual component is removed due to a consistently low output norm of the transformer layer. Our experiments show that removing or linearly approximating some of the most linear blocks of transformers does not affect significantly the loss or model performance. Moreover, in our pretraining experiments on smaller models we introduce a cosine-similarity-based regularization, aimed at reducing layer linearity. This regularization improves performance metrics on benchmarks like Tiny Stories and SuperGLUE and as well successfully decreases the linearity of the models. This study challenges the existing understanding of transformer architectures, suggesting that their operation may be more linear than previously assumed.",
    "Your Vision-Language Model Itself Is a Strong Filter: Towards High-Quality Instruction Tuning with Data Selection": "Data selection in instruction tuning emerges as a pivotal process for acquiring high-quality data and training instruction-following large language models (LLMs), but it is still a new and unexplored research area for vision-language models (VLMs). Existing data selection approaches on LLMs either rely on single unreliable scores, or use downstream tasks for selection, which is time-consuming and can lead to potential over-fitting on the chosen evaluation datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel dataset selection method, SELF-FILTER, that utilizes the VLM itself as a filter. This approach is inspired by the observation that VLMs benefit from training with the most challenging instructions. SELF-FILTER operates in two stages. In the first stage, we devise a scoring network to evaluate the difficulty of training instructions, which is co-trained with the VLM. In the second stage, we use the trained score net to measure the difficulty of each instruction, select the most challenging samples, and penalize similar samples to encourage diversity. Comprehensive experiments on LLaVA and MiniGPT-4 show that SELF-FILTER can reach better results compared to full data settings with merely about 15% samples, and can achieve superior performance against competitive baselines.",
    "Zero- and Few-Shots Knowledge Graph Triplet Extraction with Large Language Models": "In this work, we tested the Triplet Extraction (TE) capabilities of a variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) of different sizes in the Zero- and Few-Shots settings. In detail, we proposed a pipeline that dynamically gathers contextual information from a Knowledge Base (KB), both in the form of context triplets and of (sentence, triplets) pairs as examples, and provides it to the LLM through a prompt. The additional context allowed the LLMs to be competitive with all the older fully trained baselines based on the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) Network architecture. We further conducted a detailed analysis of the quality of the gathered KB context, finding it to be strongly correlated with the final TE performance of the model. In contrast, the size of the model appeared to only logarithmically improve the TE capabilities of the LLMs. We release the code on GitHub for reproducibility.",
    "Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Reranking with Large Language Models for Low-Resource Languages": "Large language models (LLMs) as listwise rerankers have shown impressive zero-shot capabilities in various passage ranking tasks. Despite their success, there is still a gap in existing literature on their effectiveness in reranking low-resource languages. To address this, we investigate how LLMs function as listwise rerankers in cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) systems with queries in English and passages in four African languages: Hausa, Somali, Swahili, and Yoruba. We analyze and compare the effectiveness of monolingual reranking using either query or document translations. We also evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs when leveraging their own generated translations. To grasp the general picture, we examine the effectiveness of multiple LLMs—the proprietary models RankGPT4 and RankGPT3.5, along with the open-source model RankZephyr. While the document translation setting, i.e., both queries and documents are in English, leads to the best reranking effectiveness, our results indicate that for specific LLMs, reranking in the African language setting achieves competitive effectiveness with the cross-lingual setting, and even performs better when using the LLM's own translations.",
    "Zero-Shot Fact-Checking with Semantic Triples and Knowledge Graphs": "Despite progress in automated fact-checking, most systems require a significant amount of labeled training data, which is expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-shot method, which instead of operating directly on the claim and evidence sentences, decomposes them into semantic triples augmented using external knowledge graphs, and uses large language models trained for natural language inference. This allows it to generalize to adversarial datasets and domains that supervised models require specific training data for. Our empirical results show that our approach outperforms previous zero-shot approaches on FEVER, FEVER-Symmetric, FEVER 2.0, and Climate-FEVER, while being comparable or better than supervised models on the adversarial and the out-of-domain datasets.",
    "Zero-shot Scientific Claim Verification Using LLMs and Citation Text": "Due to rapidly changing and advancing science, it is important to check the veracity of scientific claims and whether they are supported by research evidence. Previous versions of this task depended on supervised training, where labeled datasets were constructed through manual claim writing and evidence identification, sometimes coupled with mining citation relationships in papers. In this work, we investigate whether zero-shot scientific claim verification could be enabled using large language models (LLMs) and distant supervision examples taken directly from citation texts. We derive an in-context learning (ICL) dataset, SCitance, consisting of citation sentences (“citances”), LLM-generated negations, evidence documents, and veracity labels, and find that prompting GPT-4 with ICL examples from this dataset yields comparable performance (within 1 point F1) to previous finetuned models trained on manually curated claim-evidence pairs. Our results suggest that prompting LLMs with citance-evidence pairs directly poses a viable alternative to finetuning scientific claim verification models with manually-curated data.",
    "ZeroStance: Leveraging ChatGPT for Open-Domain Stance Detection via Dataset Generation": "Zero-shot stance detection that aims to detect the stance (typically against, favor or neutral) towards unseen targets has attracted considerable attention. However, most previous studies only focus on targets from a single or limited text domains (e.g., financial domain), and thus zero-shot models cannot generalize well to unseen targets of diverse domains (e.g., political domain). In this paper, we consider a more realistic task, i.e., open-domain stance detection, which aims at training a model that is able to generalize well to unseen targets across multiple domains of interest. Particularly, we propose a novel dataset generation method ZeroStance, which leverages ChatGPT to construct a synthetic open-domain dataset CHATStance that covers a wide range of domains. We then train an open-domain model on our synthetic dataset after proper data filtering. Extensive results indicate that our model, when trained on this synthetic dataset, shows superior generalization to unseen targets of diverse domains over baselines on most benchmarks. Our method requires only a task description in the form of a prompt and is much more cost-effective and data-efficient than previous methods. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/chenyez/ZeroStance.",
    "ZZU-NLP at SIGHAN-2024 dimABSA Task: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis with Coarse-to-Fine In-context Learning": "The DimABSA task requires fine-grained sentiment intensity prediction for restaurant reviews, including scores for Valence and Arousal dimensions for each Aspect Term. In this study, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine In-context Learning (CFICL) method based on the Baichuan2-7B model for the DimABSA task in the SIGHAN 2024 workshop. Our method improves prediction accuracy through a two-stage optimization process. In the first stage, we use fixed in-context examples and prompt templates to enhance the model's sentiment recognition capability and provide initial predictions for the test data. In the second stage, we encode the Opinion field using BERT and select the most similar training data as new in-context examples based on similarity. These examples include the Opinion field and its scores, as well as related opinion words and their average scores. By filtering for sentiment polarity, we ensure that the examples are consistent with the test data. Our method significantly improves prediction accuracy and consistency by effectively utilizing training data and optimizing in-context examples, as validated by experimental results.",
    "“My Answer is C”: First-Token Probabilities Do Not Match Text Answers in Instruction-Tuned Language Models": "The open-ended nature of language generation makes the evaluation of autoregressive large language models (LLMs) challenging. One common evaluation approach uses multiple-choice questions (MCQ) to limit the response space. The model is then evaluated by ranking the candidate answers by the log probability of the first token prediction. However, first-tokens may not consistently reflect the final response output, due to model's diverse response styles such as starting with Sure or refusing to answer. Consequently, MCQ evaluation is not indicative of model behaviour when interacting with users. But by how much? We evaluate how aligned first-token evaluation is with the text output along several dimensions, namely final option choice, refusal rate, choice distribution and robustness under prompt perturbation. Our results show that the two approaches are severely misaligned on all dimensions, reaching mismatch rates over 60%. Models heavily fine-tuned on conversational or safety data are especially impacted. Crucially, models remain misaligned even when we increasingly constrain prompts, i.e., force them to start with an option letter or example template. Our findings i) underscore the importance of inspecting the text output as well and ii) caution against relying solely on first-token evaluation.",
    "∞BENCH: Extending Long Context Evaluation Beyond 100K Tokens": "Processing and reasoning over long contexts is crucial for many practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as document comprehension and agent construction. Despite recent strides in making LLMs process contexts with more than 100K tokens, there is currently a lack of a standardized benchmark to evaluate this long-context capability. Existing public benchmarks typically focus on contexts around 10K tokens, limiting the assessment and comparison of LLMs in processing longer contexts. In this paper, we propose ∞BENCH, the first LLM benchmark featuring an average data length surpassing 100K tokens. ∞BENCH comprises synthetic and realistic tasks spanning diverse domains in English and Chinese. The tasks in ∞BENCH are designed to require an understanding of long dependencies in contexts and make simply retrieving a limited number of passages from contexts not sufficient for these tasks. Based on ∞BENCH, we evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs tailored for processing long contexts. The experimental results indicate that existing long-context LLMs still require significant advancements to process 100K+ contexts effectively. Furthermore, we present three intriguing analyses regarding the behavior of LLMs processing long context. Our code and data is released."
